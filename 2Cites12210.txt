 yes i know you citizen doctor we all know you citizen doctor said the other three he looked abstractedly from one to another and said in a lower voice after a pause will you answer his question to me then how does this happen citizen doctor said the first reluctantly he has been denounced to the section of saint antoine this citizen pointing out the second who had entered is from saint antoine the citizen here indicated nodded his head and added he is accused by saint antoine of what asked the doctor citizen doctor said the first with his former reluctance ask no more if the republic demands sacrifices from you without doubt you as a good patriot will be happy to make them the republic goes before all the people is supreme we are pressed one word the doctor entreated will you tell me who denounced him it is against rule answered the first but you can ask him of saint antoine here the doctor turned his eyes upon that man who moved uneasily on his feet rubbed his beard a little and at length said well truly it is against rule but he is denounced and gravely by the citizen and citizeness and by one other what other do you ask citizen doctor yes then said he of saint antoine with a strange look you will be answered to morrow now i am dumb happily unconscious of the new calamity at home threaded her way along the narrow streets and crossed the river by the bridge of the pont neuf reckoning in her mind the number of indispensable purchases she had to make with the basket walked at her side they both looked to the right and to the left into most of the shops they passed had a wary eye for all gregarious assemblages of people and turned out of their road to avoid any very excited group of talkers it was a raw evening and the misty river blurred to the eye with blazing lights and to the ear with harsh noises showed where the barges were stationed in which the smiths worked making guns for the army of the republic woe to the man who played tricks with that army or got undeserved promotion in it better for him that his beard had never grown for the national razor shaved him close having purchased a few small articles of grocery and a measure of oil for the lamp bethought herself of the wine they wanted after peeping into several wine shops she stopped at the sign of the good republican brutus of antiquity not far from the national palace once and twice the where the aspect of things rather took her fancy it had a quieter look than any other place of the same description they had passed and though red with patriotic caps was not so red as the rest sounding and finding him of her opinion resorted to the good republican brutus of antiquity attended by her cavalier slightly observant of the smoky lights of the people pipe in mouth playing with limp cards and yellow dominoes of the one bare breasted bare armed soot begrimed workman reading a journal aloud and of the others listening to him of the weapons worn or laid aside to be resumed of the two or three customers fallen forward asleep who in the popular high shouldered shaggy black spencer looked in that attitude like slumbering bears or dogs the two outlandish customers approached the counter and showed what they wanted as their wine was measuring out a man parted from another man in a corner and rose to depart in going he had to face no sooner did he face her than uttered a scream and clapped her hands in a moment the whole company were on their feet that somebody was assassinated by somebody vindicating a difference of opinion was the likeliest occurrence everybody looked to see somebody fall but only saw a man and a woman standing staring at each other the man with all the outward aspect of a frenchman and a thorough republican the woman evidently english what was said in this disappointing anti climax by the disciples of the good republican brutus of antiquity except that it was something very voluble and loud would have been as so much hebrew or chaldean to and her protector though they had been all ears but they had no ears for anything in their surprise for it must be recorded that not only was lost in amazement and agitation but though it seemed on his own separate and individual account was in a state of the greatest wonder what is the matter said the man who had caused to scream speaking in a vexed abrupt voice though in a low tone and in english oh dear cried clapping her hands again after not setting eyes upon you or hearing of you for so long a time do i find you here don t call me do you want to be the death of me asked the man in a furtive frightened way brother brother cried bursting into tears have i ever been so hard with you that you ask me such a cruel question then hold your meddlesome tongue said and come out if you want to speak to me pay for your wine and come out who s this man shaking her loving and dejected head at her by no means affectionate brother said through her tears let him come out too said does he think me a ghost apparently did to judge from his looks he said not a word however and exploring the depths of her reticule through her tears with great difficulty paid for her wine as she did so turned to the followers of the good republican brutus of antiquity and offered a few words of explanation in the french language which caused them all to relapse into their former places and pursuits now said stopping at the dark street corner what do you want how dreadfully unkind in a brother nothing has ever turned my love away from cried to give me such a greeting and show me no affection there confound it there said making a dab at s lips with his own now are you content only shook her head and wept in silence if you expect me to be surprised said her brother i am not surprised i knew you were here i know of most people who are here if you really don t want to endanger my existence which i half believe you do go your ways as soon as possible and let me go mine i am busy i am an official my english brother mourned casting up her tear fraught eyes that had the makings in him of one of the best and greatest of men in his native country an official among foreigners and such foreigners i would almost sooner have seen the dear boy lying in his i said so cried her brother interrupting i knew it you want to be the death of me i shall be rendered suspected by my own sister just as i am getting on the gracious and merciful heavens forbid cried far rather would i never see you again dear though i have ever loved you truly and ever shall say but one affectionate word to me and tell me there is nothing angry or estranged between us and i will detain you no longer good as if the estrangement between them had come of any culpability of hers as if had not known it for a fact years ago in the quiet corner in soho that this precious brother had spent her money and left her he was saying the affectionate word however with a far more grudging condescension and patronage than he could have shown if their relative merits and positions had been reversed which is invariably the case all the world over when touching him on the shoulder hoarsely and unexpectedly interposed with the following singular question i say might i ask the favour as to whether your name is or the official turned towards him with sudden distrust he had not previously uttered a word come said speak out you know which by the way was more than he could do himself or she calls you and she must know being your sister and i know you re you know which of the two goes first and regarding that name of likewise that warn t your name over the water what do you mean well i don t know all i mean for i can t call to mind what your name was over the water no no but i ll swear it was a name of two syllables indeed yes t other one s was one syllable i know you you was a spy witness at the bailey what in the name of the father of lies own father to yourself was you called at that time said another voice striking in that s the name for a thousand pound cried the speaker who struck in was he had his hands behind him under the skirts of his riding coat and he stood at s elbow as negligently as he might have stood at the old bailey itself don t be alarmed my dear i arrived at s to his surprise yesterday evening we agreed that i would not present myself elsewhere until all was well or unless i could be useful i present myself here to beg a little talk with your brother i wish you had a better employed brother than i wish for your sake was not a sheep of the prisons sheep was a cant word of the time for a spy under the gaolers the spy who was pale turned paler and asked him how he dared i ll tell you said i lighted on you coming out of the prison of the conciergerie while i was contemplating the walls an hour or more ago you have a face to be remembered and i remember faces well made curious by seeing you in that connection and having a reason to which you are no stranger for associating you with the misfortunes of a friend now very unfortunate i walked in your direction i walked into the wine shop here close after you and sat near you i had no difficulty in deducing from your unreserved conversation and the rumour openly going about among your admirers the nature of your calling and gradually what i had done at random seemed to shape itself into a purpose what purpose the spy asked it would be troublesome and might be dangerous to explain in the street could you favour me in confidence with some minutes of your company at the office of s bank for instance under a threat oh did i say that then why should i go there really i can t say if you can t do you mean that you won t say sir the spy irresolutely asked you apprehend me very clearly i won t s negligent recklessness of manner came powerfully in aid of his quickness and skill in such a business as he had in his secret mind and with such a man as he had to do with his practised eye saw it and made the most of it now i told you so said the spy casting a reproachful look at his sister if any trouble comes of this it s your doing come come exclaimed don t be ungrateful but for my great respect for your sister i might not have led up so pleasantly to a little proposal that i wish to make for our mutual satisfaction do you go with me to the bank i ll hear what you have got to say yes i ll go with you i propose that we first conduct your sister safely to the corner of her own street let me take your arm this is not a good city at this time for you to be out in unprotected and as your escort knows i will invite him to s with us are we ready come then recalled soon afterwards and to the end of her life remembered that as she pressed her hands on s arm and looked up in his face imploring him to do no hurt to there was a braced purpose in the arm and a kind of inspiration in the eyes which not only contradicted his light manner but changed and raised the man she was too much occupied then with fears for the brother who so little deserved her affection and with s friendly reassurances adequately to heed what she observed they left her at the corner of the street and led the way to s which was within a few minutes walk or walked at his side had just finished his dinner and was sitting before a cheery little log or two of fire perhaps looking into their blaze for the picture of that younger elderly gentleman from s who had looked into the red coals at the royal george at dover now a good many years ago he turned his head as they entered and showed the surprise with which he saw a stranger s brother sir said repeated the old gentleman i have an association with the name and with the face i told you you had a remarkable face observed coolly pray sit down as he took a chair himself he supplied the link that wanted by saying to him with a frown witness at that trial immediately remembered and regarded his new visitor with an undisguised look of abhorrence has been recognised by as the affectionate brother you have heard of said and has acknowledged the relationship i pass to worse news has been arrested again struck with consternation the old gentleman exclaimed what do you tell me i left him safe and free within these two hours and am about to return to him arrested for all that when was it done just now if at all is the best authority possible sir said and i have it from s communication to a friend and brother sheep over a bottle of wine that the arrest has taken place he left the messengers at the gate and saw them admitted by the porter there is no earthly doubt that he is retaken s business eye read in the speaker s face that it was loss of time to dwell upon the point confused but sensible that something might depend on his presence of mind he commanded himself and was silently attentive now i trust said to him that the name and influence of may stand him in as good stead to morrow you said he would be before the tribunal again to morrow yes i believe so in as good stead to morrow as to day but it may not be so i own to you i am shaken by s not having had the power to prevent this arrest he may not have known of it beforehand said but that very circumstance would be alarming when we remember how identified he is with his son in law that s true acknowledged with his troubled hand at his chin and his troubled eyes on in short said this is a desperate time when desperate games are played for desperate stakes let the doctor play the winning game i will play the losing one no man s life here is worth purchase any one carried home by the people to day may be condemned tomorrow now the stake i have resolved to play for in case of the worst is a friend in the conciergerie and the friend i purpose to myself to win is you need have good cards sir said the spy i ll run them over i ll see what i hold you know what a brute i am i wish you d give me a little brandy it was put before him and he drank off a glassful drank off another glassful pushed the bottle thoughtfully away he went on in the tone of one who really was looking over a hand at cards sheep of the prisons emissary of republican committees now turnkey now prisoner always spy and secret informer so much the more valuable here for being english that an englishman is less open to suspicion of subornation in those characters than a frenchman represents himself to his employers under a false name that s a very good card now in the employ of the republican french government was formerly in the employ of the aristocratic english government the enemy of france and freedom that s an excellent card inference clear as day in this region of suspicion that still in the pay of the aristocratic english government is the spy of the treacherous foe of the republic crouching in its bosom the english traitor and agent of all mischief so much spoken of and so difficult to find that s a card not to be beaten have you followed my hand not to understand your play returned the spy somewhat uneasily i play my ace denunciation of to the nearest section committee look over your hand and see what you have don t hurry he drew the bottle near poured out another glassful of brandy and drank it off he saw that the spy was fearful of his drinking himself into a fit state for the immediate denunciation of him seeing it he poured out and drank another glassful look over your hand carefully take time it was a poorer hand than he suspected saw losing cards in it that knew nothing of thrown out of his honourable employment in england through too much unsuccessful hard swearing there not because he was not wanted there our english reasons for vaunting our superiority to secrecy and spies are of very modern date he knew that he had crossed the channel and accepted service in france first as a tempter and an eavesdropper among his own countrymen there gradually as a tempter and an eavesdropper among the natives he knew that under the overthrown government he had been a spy upon saint antoine and s wine shop had received from the watchful police such heads of information concerning s imprisonment release and history as should serve him for an introduction to familiar conversation with the s and tried them on and had broken down with them signally he always remembered with fear and trembling that that terrible woman had knitted when he talked with her and had looked ominously at him as her fingers moved he had since seen her in the section of saint antoine over and over again produce her knitted registers and denounce people whose lives the guillotine then surely swallowed up he knew as every one employed as he was did that he was never safe that flight was impossible that he was tied fast under the shadow of the axe and that in spite of his utmost tergiversation and treachery in furtherance of the reigning terror a word might bring it down upon him once denounced and on such grave grounds as had just now been suggested to his mind he foresaw that the dreadful woman of whose unrelenting character he had seen many proofs would produce against him that fatal register and would quash his last chance of life besides that all secret men are men soon terrified here were surely cards enough of one black suit to justify the holder in growing rather livid as he turned them over you scarcely seem to like your hand said with the greatest composure do you play i think sir said the spy in the meanest manner as he turned to i may appeal to a gentleman of your years and benevolence to put it to this other gentleman so much your junior whether he can under any circumstances reconcile it to his station to play that ace of which he has spoken i admit that i am a spy and that it is considered a discreditable station though it must be filled by somebody but this gentleman is no spy and why should he so demean himself as to make himself one i play my ace said taking the answer on himself and looking at his watch without any scruple in a very few minutes i should have hoped gentlemen both said the spy always striving to hook into the discussion that your respect for my sister i could not better testify my respect for your sister than by finally relieving her of her brother said you think not sir i have thoroughly made up my mind about it the smooth manner of the spy curiously in dissonance with his ostentatiously rough dress and probably with his usual demeanour received such a check from the inscrutability of who was a mystery to wiser and honester men than he that it faltered here and failed him while he was at a loss said resuming his former air of contemplating cards and indeed now i think again i have a strong impression that i have another good card here not yet enumerated that friend and fellow sheep who spoke of himself as pasturing in the country prisons who was he french you don t know him said the spy quickly french eh repeated musing and not appearing to notice him at all though he echoed his word well he may be is i assure you said the spy though it s not important though it s not important repeated in the same mechanical way though it s not important no it s not important no yet i know the face i think not i am sure not it can t be said the spy it can t be muttered retrospectively and idling his glass which fortunately was a small one again can t be spoke good french yet like a foreigner i thought provincial said the spy no foreign cried striking his open hand on the table as a light broke clearly on his mind disguised but the same man we had that man before us at the old bailey now there you are hasty sir said with a smile that gave his aquiline nose an extra inclination to one side there you really give me an advantage over you who i will unreservedly admit at this distance of time was a partner of mine has been dead several years i attended him in his last illness he was buried in london at the church of saint pancras in the fields his unpopularity with the blackguard multitude at the moment prevented my following his remains but i helped to lay him in his coffin here became aware from where he sat of a most remarkable goblin shadow on the wall tracing it to its source he discovered it to be caused by a sudden extraordinary rising and stiffening of all the risen and stiff hair on s head let us be reasonable said the spy and let us be fair to show you how mistaken you are and what an unfounded assumption yours is i will lay before you a certificate of s burial which i happened to have carried in my pocket book with a hurried hand he produced and opened it ever since there it is oh look at it look at it you may take it in your hand it s no forgery here perceived the reflection on the wall to elongate and rose and stepped forward his hair could not have been more violently on end if it had been that moment dressed by the cow with the crumpled horn in the house that built unseen by the spy stood at his side and touched him on the shoulder like a ghostly bailiff that there master said with a taciturn and iron bound visage so you put him in his coffin i did who took him out of it leaned back in his chair and stammered what do you mean i mean said that he warn t never in it no not he i ll have my head took off if he was ever in it the spy looked round at the two gentlemen they both looked in unspeakable astonishment at i tell you said that you buried paving stones and earth in that there coffin don t go and tell me that you buried it was a take in me and two more knows it how do you know it what s that to you growled it s you i have got a old grudge again is it with your shameful impositions upon tradesmen i d catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a guinea who with had been lost in amazement at this turn of the business here requested to moderate and explain himself at another time sir he returned evasively the present time is ill conwenient for explainin what i stand to is that he knows well wot that there was never in that there coffin let him say he was in so much as a word of one syllable and i ll either catch hold of his throat and choke him for half a guinea dwelt upon this as
