peculiar ear of a place that as stood at the open window looking for the father and daughter whose steps he heard he fancied they would never approach not only would the echoes die away as though the steps had gone but echoes of other steps that never came would be heard in their stead and would die away for good when they seemed close at hand however father and daughter did at last appear and was ready at the street door to receive them was a pleasant sight albeit wild and red and grim taking off her darling s bonnet when she came up stairs and touching it up with the ends of her handkerchief and blowing the dust off it and folding her mantle ready for laying by and smoothing her rich hair with as much pride as she could possibly have taken in her own hair if she had been the vainest and handsomest of women her darling was a pleasant sight too embracing her and thanking her and protesting against her taking so much trouble for her which last she only dared to do playfully or sorely hurt would have retired to her own chamber and cried the doctor was a pleasant sight too looking on at them and telling how she spoilt in accents and with eyes that had as much spoiling in them as had and would have had more if it were possible was a pleasant sight too beaming at all this in his little wig and thanking his bachelor stars for having lighted him in his declining years to a home but no hundreds of people came to see the sights and looked in vain for the fulfilment of s prediction dinner time and still no hundreds of people in the arrangements of the little household took charge of the lower regions and always acquitted herself marvellously her dinners of a very modest quality were so well cooked and so well served and so neat in their contrivances half english and half french that nothing could be better s friendship being of the thoroughly practical kind she had ravaged soho and the adjacent provinces in search of impoverished french who tempted by shillings and half crowns would impart culinary mysteries to her from these decayed sons and daughters of gaul she had acquired such wonderful arts that the woman and girl who formed the staff of domestics regarded her as quite a sorceress or cinderella s godmother who would send out for a fowl a rabbit a vegetable or two from the garden and change them into anything she pleased on sundays dined at the doctor s table but on other days persisted in taking her meals at unknown periods either in the lower regions or in her own room on the second floor a blue chamber to which no one but her ever gained admittance on this occasion responding to s pleasant face and pleasant efforts to please her unbent exceedingly so the dinner was very pleasant too it was an oppressive day and after dinner proposed that the wine should be carried out under the plane tree and they should sit there in the air as everything turned upon her and revolved about her they went out under the plane tree and she carried the wine down for the special benefit of she had installed herself some time before as s cup bearer and while they sat under the plane tree talking she kept his glass replenished mysterious backs and ends of houses peeped at them as they talked and the plane tree whispered to them in its own way above their heads still the hundreds of people did not present themselves presented himself while they were sitting under the plane tree but he was only one received him kindly and so did but suddenly became afflicted with a twitching in the head and body and retired into the house she was not unfrequently the victim of this disorder and she called it in familiar conversation a fit of the jerks the doctor was in his best condition and looked specially young the resemblance between him and was very strong at such times and as they sat side by side she leaning on his shoulder and he resting his arm on the back of her chair it was very agreeable to trace the likeness he had been talking all day on many subjects and with unusual vivacity pray said as they sat under the plane tree and he said it in the natural pursuit of the topic in hand which happened to be the old buildings of london have you seen much of the tower and i have been there but only casually we have seen enough of it to know that it teems with interest little more i have been there as you remember said with a smile though reddening a little angrily in another character and not in a character that gives facilities for seeing much of it they told me a curious thing when i was there what was that asked in making some alterations the workmen came upon an old dungeon which had been for many years built up and forgotten every stone of its inner wall was covered by inscriptions which had been carved by prisoners dates names complaints and prayers upon a corner stone in an angle of the wall one prisoner who seemed to have gone to execution had cut as his last work three letters they were done with some very poor instrument and hurriedly with an unsteady hand at first they were read as d i c but on being more carefully examined the last letter was found to be there was no record or legend of any prisoner with those initials and many fruitless guesses were made what the name could have been at length it was suggested that the letters were not initials but the complete word dig the floor was examined very carefully under the inscription and in the earth beneath a stone or tile or some fragment of paving were found the ashes of a paper mingled with the ashes of a small leathern case or bag what the unknown prisoner had written will never be read but he had written something and hidden it away to keep it from the gaoler my father exclaimed you are ill he had suddenly started up with his hand to his head his manner and his look quite terrified them all no my dear not ill there are large drops of rain falling and they made me start we had better go in he recovered himself almost instantly rain was really falling in large drops and he showed the back of his hand with rain drops on it but he said not a single word in reference to the discovery that had been told of and as they went into the house the business eye of either detected or fancied it detected on his face as it turned towards the same singular look that had been upon it when it turned towards him in the passages of the court house he recovered himself so quickly however that had doubts of his business eye the arm of the golden giant in the hall was not more steady than he was when he stopped under it to remark to them that he was not yet proof against slight surprises if he ever would be and that the rain had startled him tea time and making tea with another fit of the jerks upon her and yet no hundreds of people had lounged in but he made only two the night was so very sultry that although they sat with doors and windows open they were overpowered by heat when the tea table was done with they all moved to one of the windows and looked out into the heavy twilight sat by her father sat beside her leaned against a window the curtains were long and white and some of the thunder gusts that whirled into the corner caught them up to the ceiling and waved them like spectral wings the rain drops are still falling large heavy and few said it comes slowly it comes surely said they spoke low as people watching and waiting mostly do as people in a dark room watching and waiting for lightning always do there was a great hurry in the streets of people speeding away to get shelter before the storm broke the wonderful corner for echoes resounded with the echoes of footsteps coming and going yet not a footstep was there a multitude of people and yet a solitude said when they had listened for a while is it not impressive asked sometimes i have sat here of an evening until i have fancied but even the shade of a foolish fancy makes me shudder to night when all is so black and solemn let us shudder too we may know what it is it will seem nothing to you such whims are only impressive as we originate them i think they are not to be communicated i have sometimes sat alone here of an evening listening until i have made the echoes out to be the echoes of all the footsteps that are coming by and bye into our lives there is a great crowd coming one day into our lives if that be so sydney struck in in his moody way the footsteps were incessant and the hurry of them became more and more rapid the corner echoed and re echoed with the tread of feet some as it seemed under the windows some as it seemed in the room some coming some going some breaking off some stopping altogether all in the distant streets and not one within sight are all these footsteps destined to come to all of us or are we to divide them among us i don t know i told you it was a foolish fancy but you asked for it when i have yielded myself to it i have been alone and then i have imagined them the footsteps of the people who are to come into my life and my father s i take them into mine said i ask no questions and make no stipulations there is a great crowd bearing down upon us and i see them by the lightning he added the last words after there had been a vivid flash which had shown him lounging in the window and i hear them he added again after a peal of thunder here they come fast fierce and furious it was the rush and roar of rain that he typified and it stopped him for no voice could be heard in it a memorable storm of thunder and lightning broke with that sweep of water and there was not a moment s interval in crash and fire and rain until after the moon rose at midnight the great bell of saint paul s was striking one in the cleared air when escorted by high booted and bearing a lantern set forth on his return passage to clerkenwell there were solitary patches of road on the way between soho and clerkenwell and mindful of foot pads always retained for this service though it was usually performed a good two hours earlier what a night it has been almost a night said to bring the dead out of their graves i never see the night myself master nor yet i don t expect to what would do that answered good night said the man of business good night shall we ever see such a night again together perhaps perhaps see the great crowd of people with its rush and roar bearing down upon them too monseigneur one of the great lords in power at the court held his fortnightly reception in his grand hotel in paris monseigneur was in his inner room his sanctuary of sanctuaries the holiest of holiests to the crowd of worshippers in the suite of rooms without monseigneur was about to take his chocolate monseigneur could swallow a great many things with ease and was by some few sullen minds supposed to be rather rapidly swallowing france but his morning s chocolate could not so much as get into the throat of monseigneur without the aid of four strong men besides the cook yes it took four men all four ablaze with gorgeous decoration and the chief of them unable to exist with fewer than two gold watches in his pocket emulative of the noble and chaste fashion set by monseigneur to conduct the happy chocolate to monseigneur s lips one lacquey carried the chocolate pot into the sacred presence a second milled and frothed the chocolate with the little instrument he bore for that function a third presented the favoured napkin a fourth he of the two gold watches poured the chocolate out it was impossible for monseigneur to dispense with one of these attendants on the chocolate and hold his high place under the admiring heavens deep would have been the blot upon his escutcheon if his chocolate had been ignobly waited on by only three men he must have died of two monseigneur had been out at a little supper last night where the comedy and the grand opera were charmingly represented monseigneur was out at a little supper most nights with fascinating company so polite and so impressible was monseigneur that the comedy and the grand opera had far more influence with him in the tiresome articles of state affairs and state secrets than the needs of all france a happy circumstance for france as the like always is for all countries similarly favoured always was for england by way of example in the regretted days of the merry stuart who sold it monseigneur had one truly noble idea of general public business which was to let everything go on in its own way of particular public business monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that it must all go his way tend to his own power and pocket of his pleasures general and particular monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that the world was made for them the text of his order altered from the original by only a pronoun which is not much ran the earth and the fulness thereof are mine saith monseigneur yet monseigneur had slowly found that vulgar embarrassments crept into his affairs both private and public and he had as to both classes of affairs allied himself perforce with a farmer general as to finances public because monseigneur could not make anything at all of them and must consequently let them out to somebody who could as to finances private because farmer generals were rich and monseigneur after generations of great luxury and expense was growing poor hence monseigneur had taken his sister from a convent while there was yet time to ward off the impending veil the cheapest garment she could wear and had bestowed her as a prize upon a very rich farmer general poor in family which farmer general carrying an appropriate cane with a golden apple on the top of it was now among the company in the outer rooms much prostrated before by mankind always excepting superior mankind of the blood of monseigneur who his own wife included looked down upon him with the loftiest contempt a sumptuous man was the farmer general thirty horses stood in his stables twenty four male domestics sat in his halls six body women waited on his wife as one who pretended to do nothing but plunder and forage where he could the farmer general howsoever his matrimonial relations conduced to social morality was at least the greatest reality among the personages who attended at the hotel of monseigneur that day for the rooms though a beautiful scene to look at and adorned with every device of decoration that the taste and skill of the time could achieve were in truth not a sound business considered with any reference to the scarecrows in the rags and nightcaps elsewhere and not so far off either but that the watching towers of notre dame almost equidistant from the two extremes could see them both they would have been an exceedingly uncomfortable business if that could have been anybody s business at the house of monseigneur military officers destitute of military knowledge naval officers with no idea of a ship civil officers without a notion of affairs brazen ecclesiastics of the worst world worldly with sensual eyes loose tongues and looser lives all totally unfit for their several callings all lying horribly in pretending to belong to them but all nearly or remotely of the order of monseigneur and therefore foisted on all public employments from which anything was to be got these were to be told off by the score and the score people not immediately connected with monseigneur or the state yet equally unconnected with anything that was real or with lives passed in travelling by any straight road to any true earthly end were no less abundant doctors who made great fortunes out of dainty remedies for imaginary disorders that never existed smiled upon their courtly patients in the ante chambers of monseigneur projectors who had discovered every kind of remedy for the little evils with which the state was touched except the remedy of setting to work in earnest to root out a single sin poured their distracting babble into any ears they could lay hold of at the reception of monseigneur unbelieving philosophers who were remodelling the world with words and making card towers of babel to scale the skies with talked with unbelieving chemists who had an eye on the transmutation of metals at this wonderful gathering accumulated by monseigneur exquisite gentlemen of the finest breeding which was at that remarkable time and has been since to be known by its fruits of indifference to every natural subject of human interest were in the most exemplary state of exhaustion at the hotel of monseigneur such homes had these various notabilities left behind them in the fine world of paris that the spies among the assembled devotees of monseigneur forming a goodly half of the polite company would have found it hard to discover among the angels of that sphere one solitary wife who in her manners and appearance owned to being a mother indeed except for the mere act of bringing a troublesome creature into this world which does not go far towards the realisation of the name of mother there was no such thing known to the fashion peasant women kept the unfashionable babies close and brought them up and charming grandmammas of sixty dressed and supped as at twenty the leprosy of unreality disfigured every human creature in attendance upon monseigneur in the outermost room were half a dozen exceptional people who had had for a few years some vague misgiving in them that things in general were going rather wrong as a promising way of setting them right half of the half dozen had become members of a fantastic sect of convulsionists and were even then considering within themselves whether they should foam rage roar and turn cataleptic on the spot thereby setting up a highly intelligible finger post to the future for monseigneur s guidance besides these dervishes were other three who had rushed into another sect which mended matters with a jargon about the centre of truth holding that man had got out of the centre of truth which did not need much demonstration but had not got out of the circumference and that he was to be kept from flying out of the circumference and was even to be shoved back into the centre by fasting and seeing of spirits among these accordingly much discoursing with spirits went on and it did a world of good which never became manifest but the comfort was that all the company at the grand hotel of monseigneur were perfectly dressed if the day of judgment had only been ascertained to be a dress day everybody there would have been eternally correct such frizzling and powdering and sticking up of hair such delicate complexions artificially preserved and mended such gallant swords to look at and such delicate honour to the sense of smell would surely keep anything going for ever and ever the exquisite gentlemen of the finest breeding wore little pendent trinkets that chinked as they languidly moved these golden fetters rang like precious little bells and what with that ringing and with the rustle of silk and brocade and fine linen there was a flutter in the air that fanned saint antoine and his devouring hunger far away dress was the one unfailing talisman and charm used for keeping all things in their places everybody was dressed for a fancy ball that was never to leave off from the palace of the tuileries through monseigneur and the whole court through the chambers the tribunals of justice and all society except the scarecrows the fancy ball descended to the common executioner who in pursuance of the charm was required to officiate frizzled powdered in a gold laced coat pumps and white silk stockings at the gallows and the wheel the axe was a rarity monsieur paris as it was the episcopal mode among his brother professors of the provinces monsieur orleans and the rest to call him presided in this dainty dress and who among the company at monseigneur s reception in that seventeen hundred and eightieth year of our lord could possibly doubt that a system rooted in a frizzled hangman powdered gold laced pumped and white silk stockinged would see the very stars out monseigneur having eased his four men of their burdens and taken his chocolate caused the doors of the holiest of holiests to be thrown open and issued forth then what submission what cringing and fawning what servility what abject humiliation as to bowing down in body and spirit nothing in that way was left for heaven which may have been one among other reasons why the worshippers of monseigneur never troubled it bestowing a word of promise here and a smile there a whisper on one happy slave and a wave of the hand on another monseigneur affably passed through his rooms to the remote region of the circumference of truth there monseigneur turned and came back again and so in due course of time got himself shut up in his sanctuary by the chocolate sprites and was seen no more the show being over the flutter in the air became quite a little storm and the precious little bells went ringing downstairs there was soon but one person left of all the crowd and he with his hat under his arm and his snuff box in his hand slowly passed among the mirrors on his way out i devote you said this person stopping at the last door on his way and turning in the direction of the sanctuary to the devil with that he shook the snuff from his fingers as if he had shaken the dust from his feet and quietly walked downstairs he was a man of about sixty handsomely dressed haughty in manner and with a face like a fine mask a face of a transparent paleness every feature in it clearly defined one set expression on it the nose beautifully formed otherwise was very slightly pinched at the top of each nostril in those two compressions or dints the only little change that the face ever showed resided they persisted in changing colour sometimes and they would be occasionally dilated and contracted by something like a faint pulsation then they gave a look of treachery and cruelty to the whole countenance examined with attention its capacity of helping such a look was to be found in the line of the mouth and the lines of the orbits of the eyes being much too horizontal and thin still in the effect of the face made it was a handsome face and a remarkable one its owner went downstairs into the courtyard got into his carriage and drove away not many people had talked with him at the reception he had stood in a little space apart and monseigneur might have been warmer in his manner it appeared under the circumstances rather agreeable to him to see the common people dispersed before his horses and often barely escaping from being run down his man drove as if he were charging an enemy and the furious recklessness of the man brought no check into the face or to the lips of the master the complaint had sometimes made itself audible even in that deaf city and dumb age that in the narrow streets without footways the fierce patrician custom of hard driving endangered and maimed the mere vulgar in a barbarous manner but few cared enough for that to think of it a second time and in this matter as in all others the common wretches were left to get out of their difficulties as they could with a wild rattle and clatter and an inhuman abandonment of consideration not easy to be understood in these days the carriage dashed through streets and swept round corners with women screaming before it and men clutching each other and clutching children out of its way at last swooping at a street corner by a fountain one of its wheels came to a sickening little jolt and there was a loud cry from a number of voices and the horses reared and plunged but for the latter inconvenience the carriage probably would not have stopped carriages were often known to drive on and leave their wounded behind and why not but the frightened valet had got down in a hurry and there were twenty hands at the horses bridles what has gone wrong said monsieur calmly looking out a tall man in a nightcap had caught up a bundle from among the feet of the horses and had laid it on the basement of the fountain and was down in the mud and wet howling over it like a wild animal pardon monsieur the marquis said a ragged and submissive man it is a child why does he make that abominable noise is it his child excuse me monsieur the marquis it is a pity yes the fountain was a little removed for the street opened where it was into a space some ten or twelve yards square as the tall man suddenly got up from the ground and came running at the carriage monsieur the marquis clapped his hand for an instant on his sword hilt killed shrieked the man in wild desperation extending both arms at their length above his head and staring at him dead the people closed round and looked at monsieur the marquis there was nothing revealed by the many eyes that looked at him but watchfulness and eagerness there was no visible menacing or anger neither did the people say anything after the first cry they had been silent and they remained so the voice of the submissive man who had spoken was flat and tame in its extreme submission monsieur the marquis ran his eyes over them all as if they had been mere rats come out of their holes he took out his purse it is extraordinary to me said he that you people cannot take care of yourselves and your children one or the other of you is for ever in the way how do i know what injury you have done my horses see give him that he threw out a gold coin for the valet to pick up and all the heads craned forward that all the eyes might look down at it as it fell the tall man called out again with a most unearthly cry dead he was arrested by the quick arrival of another man for whom the rest made way on seeing him the miserable creature fell upon his shoulder sobbing and crying and pointing to the fountain where some women were stooping over the motionless bundle and moving gently about it they were as silent however as the men i know all i know all said the last comer be a brave man my gaspard it is better for the poor little plaything to die so than to live it has died in a moment without pain could it have lived an hour as happily you are a philosopher you there said the marquis smiling how do they call you they call me of what trade monsieur the marquis vendor of wine pick up that philosopher and vendor of wine said the marquis throwing him another gold coin and spend it as you will the horses there are they right without deigning to look at the assemblage a second time monsieur the marquis leaned back in his seat and was just being driven away with the air of a gentleman who had accidentally broke some common thing and had paid for it and could afford to pay for it when his ease was suddenly disturbed by a coin flying into his carriage and ringing on its floor hold said monsieur the marquis hold the horses who threw that he looked to the spot where the vendor of wine had stood a moment before but the wretched father was grovelling on his face on the pavement in that spot and the figure that stood beside him was the figure of a dark stout woman knitting you dogs said the marquis but smoothly and with an unchanged front except as to the spots on his nose i would ride over any of you very willingly and exterminate you from the earth if i knew which rascal threw at the carriage and if that brigand were sufficiently near it he should be crushed under the wheels so cowed was their condition and so long and hard their experience of what such a man could do to them within the law and beyond it that not a voice or a hand or even an eye was raised among the men not one but the woman who stood knitting looked up steadily and looked the marquis in the face it was not for his dignity to notice it his contemptuous eyes passed over her and over all the other rats and he leaned back in his seat again and gave the word go on he was driven on and other carriages came whirling by in quick succession the minister the state projector the farmer general the doctor the lawyer the ecclesiastic the grand opera the comedy the whole fancy ball in a bright continuous flow came whirling by the rats had crept out of their holes to look on and they remained looking on for hours soldiers and police often passing between them and the spectacle and making a barrier behind which they slunk and through
