group when it was done some diamonds very bright and sparkling glanced on the bride s hand which were newly released from the dark obscurity of one of mr lorry s pockets they returned home to breakfast and all went well and in due course the golden hair that had mingled with the poor shoemaker s white locks in the paris garret were mingled with them again in the morning sunlight on the threshold of the door at parting it was a hard parting though it was not for long but her father cheered her and said at last gently disengaging himself from her enfolding arms take her charles she is yours and her agitated hand waved to them from a chaise window and she was gone the corner being out of the way of the idle and curious and the preparations having been very simple and few the doctor mr lorry and miss pross were left quite alone it was when they turned into the welcome shade of the cool old hall that mr lorry observed a great change to have come over the doctor as if the golden arm uplifted there had struck him a poisoned blow he had naturally repressed much and some revulsion might have been expected in him when the occasion for repression was gone but it was the old scared lost look that troubled mr lorry and through his absent manner of clasping his head and drearily wandering away into his own room when they got up stairs mr lorry was reminded of defarge the wine shop keeper and the starlight ride i think he whispered to miss pross after anxious consideration i think we had best not speak to him just now or at all disturb him i must look in at tellson s so i will go there at once and come back presently then we will take him a ride into the country and dine there and all will be well it was easier for mr lorry to look in at tellson s than to look out of tellson s he was detained two hours when he came back he ascended the old staircase alone having asked no question of the servant going thus into the doctor s rooms he was stopped by a low sound of knocking good god he said with a start what s that miss pross with a terrified face was at his ear o me o me all is lost cried she wringing her hands what is to be told to ladybird he doesn t know me and is making shoes mr lorry said what he could to calm her and went himself into the doctor s room the bench was turned towards the light as it had been when he had seen the shoemaker at his work before and his head was bent down and he was very busy doctor manette my dear friend doctor manette the doctor looked at him for a moment half inquiringly half as if he were angry at being spoken to and bent over his work again he had laid aside his coat and waistcoat his shirt was open at the throat as it used to be when he did that work and even the old haggard faded surface of face had come back to him he worked hard impatiently as if in some sense of having been interrupted mr lorry glanced at the work in his hand and observed that it was a shoe of the old size and shape he took up another that was lying by him and asked what it was a young lady s walking shoe he muttered without looking up it ought to have been finished long ago let it be but doctor manette look at me he obeyed in the old mechanically submissive manner without pausing in his work you know me my dear friend think again this is not your proper occupation think dear friend nothing would induce him to speak more he looked up for an instant at a time when he was requested to do so but no persuasion would extract a word from him he worked and worked and worked in silence and words fell on him as they would have fallen on an echoless wall or on the air the only ray of hope that mr lorry could discover was that he sometimes furtively looked up without being asked in that there seemed a faint expression of curiosity or perplexity as though he were trying to reconcile some doubts in his mind two things at once impressed themselves on mr lorry as important above all others the first that this must be kept secret from lucie the second that it must be kept secret from all who knew him in conjunction with miss pross he took immediate steps towards the latter precaution by giving out that the doctor was not well and required a few days of complete rest in aid of the kind deception to be practised on his daughter miss pross was to write describing his having been called away professionally and referring to an imaginary letter of two or three hurried lines in his own hand represented to have been addressed to her by the same post these measures advisable to be taken in any case mr lorry took in the hope of his coming to himself if that should happen soon he kept another course in reserve which was to have a certain opinion that he thought the best on the doctor s case in the hope of his recovery and of resort to this third course being thereby rendered practicable mr lorry resolved to watch him attentively with as little appearance as possible of doing so he therefore made arrangements to absent himself from tellson s for the first time in his life and took his post by the window in the same room he was not long in discovering that it was worse than useless to speak to him since on being pressed he became worried he abandoned that attempt on the first day and resolved merely to keep himself always before him as a silent protest against the delusion into which he had fallen or was falling he remained therefore in his seat near the window reading and writing and expressing in as many pleasant and natural ways as he could think of that it was a free place doctor manette took what was given him to eat and drink and worked on that first day until it was too dark to see worked on half an hour after mr lorry could not have seen for his life to read or write when he put his tools aside as useless until morning mr lorry rose and said to him will you go out he looked down at the floor on either side of him in the old manner looked up in the old manner and repeated in the old low voice out yes for a walk with me why not he made no effort to say why not and said not a word more but mr lorry thought he saw as he leaned forward on his bench in the dusk with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands that he was in some misty way asking himself why not the sagacity of the man of business perceived an advantage here and determined to hold it miss pross and he divided the night into two watches and observed him at intervals from the adjoining room he paced up and down for a long time before he lay down but when he did finally lay himself down he fell asleep in the morning he was up betimes and went straight to his bench and to work on this second day mr lorry saluted him cheerfully by his name and spoke to him on topics that had been of late familiar to them he returned no reply but it was evident that he heard what was said and that he thought about it however confusedly this encouraged mr lorry to have miss pross in with her work several times during the day at those times they quietly spoke of lucie and of her father then present precisely in the usual manner and as if there were nothing amiss this was done without any demonstrative accompaniment not long enough or often enough to harass him and it lightened mr lorry s friendly heart to believe that he looked up oftener and that he appeared to be stirred by some perception of inconsistencies surrounding him when it fell dark again mr lorry asked him as before dear doctor will you go out as before he repeated out yes for a walk with me why not this time mr lorry feigned to go out when he could extract no answer from him and after remaining absent for an hour returned in the meanwhile the doctor had removed to the seat in the window and had sat there looking down at the plane tree but on mr lorry s return he slipped away to his bench the time went very slowly on and mr lorry s hope darkened and his heart grew heavier again and grew yet heavier and heavier every day the third day came and went the fourth the fifth five days six days seven days eight days nine days with a hope ever darkening and with a heart always growing heavier and heavier mr lorry passed through this anxious time the secret was well kept and lucie was unconscious and happy but he could not fail to observe that the shoemaker whose hand had been a little out at first was growing dreadfully skilful and that he had never been so intent on his work and that his hands had never been so nimble and expert as in the dusk of the ninth evening worn out by anxious watching mr lorry fell asleep at his post on the tenth morning of his suspense he was startled by the shining of the sun into the room where a heavy slumber had overtaken him when it was dark night he rubbed his eyes and roused himself but he doubted when he had done so whether he was not still asleep for going to the door of the doctor s room and looking in he perceived that the shoemaker s bench and tools were put aside again and that the doctor himself sat reading at the window he was in his usual morning dress and his face which mr lorry could distinctly see though still very pale was calmly studious and attentive even when he had satisfied himself that he was awake mr lorry felt giddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking might not be a disturbed dream of his own for did not his eyes show him his friend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect and employed as usual and was there any sign within their range that the change of which he had so strong an impression had actually happened it was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment the answer being obvious if the impression were not produced by a real corresponding and sufficient cause how came he jarvis lorry there how came he to have fallen asleep in his clothes on the sofa in doctor manette s consulting room and to be debating these points outside the doctor s bedroom door in the early morning within a few minutes miss pross stood whispering at his side if he had had any particle of doubt left her talk would of necessity have resolved it but he was by that time clear headed and had none he advised that they should let the time go by until the regular breakfast hour and should then meet the doctor as if nothing unusual had occurred if he appeared to be in his customary state of mind mr lorry would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from the opinion he had been in his anxiety so anxious to obtain miss pross submitting herself to his judgment the scheme was worked out with care having abundance of time for his usual methodical toilette mr lorry presented himself at the breakfast hour in his usual white linen and with his usual neat leg the doctor was summoned in the usual way and came to breakfast so far as it was possible to comprehend him without overstepping those delicate and gradual approaches which mr lorry felt to be the only safe advance he at first supposed that his daughter s marriage had taken place yesterday an incidental allusion purposely thrown out to the day of the week and the day of the month set him thinking and counting and evidently made him uneasy in all other respects however he was so composedly himself that mr lorry determined to have the aid he sought and that aid was his own therefore when the breakfast was done and cleared away and he and the doctor were left together mr lorry said feelingly my dear manette i am anxious to have your opinion in confidence on a very curious case in which i am deeply interested that is to say it is very curious to me perhaps to your better information it may be less so glancing at his hands which were discoloured by his late work the doctor looked troubled and listened attentively he had already glanced at his hands more than once doctor manette said mr lorry touching him affectionately on the arm the case is the case of a particularly dear friend of mine pray give your mind to it and advise me well for his sake and above all for his daughter s his daughter s my dear manette if i understand said the doctor in a subdued tone some mental shock yes be explicit said the doctor spare no detail mr lorry saw that they understood one another and proceeded my dear manette it is the case of an old and a prolonged shock of great acuteness and severity to the affections the feelings the the as you express it the mind the mind it is the case of a shock under which the sufferer was borne down one cannot say for how long because i believe he cannot calculate the time himself and there are no other means of getting at it it is the case of a shock from which the sufferer recovered by a process that he cannot trace himself as i once heard him publicly relate in a striking manner it is the case of a shock from which he has recovered so completely as to be a highly intelligent man capable of close application of mind and great exertion of body and of constantly making fresh additions to his stock of knowledge which was already very large but unfortunately there has been he paused and took a deep breath a slight relapse the doctor in a low voice asked of how long duration nine days and nights how did it show itself i infer glancing at his hands again in the resumption of some old pursuit connected with the shock that is the fact now did you ever see him asked the doctor distinctly and collectedly though in the same low voice engaged in that pursuit originally once and when the relapse fell on him was he in most respects or in all respects as he was then i think in all respects you spoke of his daughter does his daughter know of the relapse no it has been kept from her and i hope will always be kept from her it is known only to myself and to one other who may be trusted the doctor grasped his hand and murmured that was very kind that was very thoughtful mr lorry grasped his hand in return and neither of the two spoke for a little while now my dear manette said mr lorry at length in his most considerate and most affectionate way i am a mere man of business and unfit to cope with such intricate and difficult matters i do not possess the kind of information necessary i do not possess the kind of intelligence i want guiding there is no man in this world on whom i could so rely for right guidance as on you tell me how does this relapse come about is there danger of another could a repetition of it be prevented how should a repetition of it be treated how does it come about at all what can i do for my friend no man ever can have been more desirous in his heart to serve a friend than i am to serve mine if i knew how but i don t know how to originate in such a case if your sagacity knowledge and experience could put me on the right track i might be able to do so much unenlightened and undirected i can do so little pray discuss it with me pray enable me to see it a little more clearly and teach me how to be a little more useful doctor manette sat meditating after these earnest words were spoken and mr lorry did not press him i think it probable said the doctor breaking silence with an effort that the relapse you have described my dear friend was not quite unforeseen by its subject was it dreaded by him mr lorry ventured to ask very much he said it with an involuntary shudder you have no idea how such an apprehension weighs on the sufferer s mind and how difficult how almost impossible it is for him to force himself to utter a word upon the topic that oppresses him would he asked mr lorry be sensibly relieved if he could prevail upon himself to impart that secret brooding to any one when it is on him i think so but it is as i have told you next to impossible i even believe it in some cases to be quite impossible now said mr lorry gently laying his hand on the doctor s arm again after a short silence on both sides to what would you refer this attack i believe returned doctor manette that there had been a strong and extraordinary revival of the train of thought and remembrance that was the first cause of the malady some intense associations of a most distressing nature were vividly recalled i think it is probable that there had long been a dread lurking in his mind that those associations would be recalled say under certain circumstances say on a particular occasion he tried to prepare himself in vain perhaps the effort to prepare himself made him less able to bear it would he remember what took place in the relapse asked mr lorry with natural hesitation the doctor looked desolately round the room shook his head and answered in a low voice not at all now as to the future hinted mr lorry as to the future said the doctor recovering firmness i should have great hope as it pleased heaven in its mercy to restore him so soon i should have great hope he yielding under the pressure of a complicated something long dreaded and long vaguely foreseen and contended against and recovering after the cloud had burst and passed i should hope that the worst was over well well that s good comfort i am thankful said mr lorry i am thankful repeated the doctor bending his head with reverence there are two other points said mr lorry on which i am anxious to be instructed i may go on you cannot do your friend a better service the doctor gave him his hand to the first then he is of a studious habit and unusually energetic he applies himself with great ardour to the acquisition of professional knowledge to the conducting of experiments to many things now does he do too much i think not it may be the character of his mind to be always in singular need of occupation that may be in part natural to it in part the result of affliction the less it was occupied with healthy things the more it would be in danger of turning in the unhealthy direction he may have observed himself and made the discovery you are sure that he is not under too great a strain i think i am quite sure of it my dear manette if he were overworked now my dear lorry i doubt if that could easily be there has been a violent stress in one direction and it needs a counterweight excuse me as a persistent man of business assuming for a moment that he was overworked it would show itself in some renewal of this disorder i do not think so i do not think said doctor manette with the firmness of self conviction that anything but the one train of association would renew it i think that henceforth nothing but some extraordinary jarring of that chord could renew it after what has happened and after his recovery i find it difficult to imagine any such violent sounding of that string again i trust and i almost believe that the circumstances likely to renew it are exhausted he spoke with the diffidence of a man who knew how slight a thing would overset the delicate organisation of the mind and yet with the confidence of a man who had slowly won his assurance out of personal endurance and distress it was not for his friend to abate that confidence he professed himself more relieved and encouraged than he really was and approached his second and last point he felt it to be the most difficult of all but remembering his old sunday morning conversation with miss pross and remembering what he had seen in the last nine days he knew that he must face it the occupation resumed under the influence of this passing affliction so happily recovered from said mr lorry clearing his throat we will call blacksmith s work blacksmith s work we will say to put a case and for the sake of illustration that he had been used in his bad time to work at a little forge we will say that he was unexpectedly found at his forge again is it not a pity that he should keep it by him the doctor shaded his forehead with his hand and beat his foot nervously on the ground he has always kept it by him said mr lorry with an anxious look at his friend now would it not be better that he should let it go still the doctor with shaded forehead beat his foot nervously on the ground you do not find it easy to advise me said mr lorry i quite understand it to be a nice question and yet i think and there he shook his head and stopped you see said doctor manette turning to him after an uneasy pause it is very hard to explain consistently the innermost workings of this poor man s mind he once yearned so frightfully for that occupation and it was so welcome when it came no doubt it relieved his pain so much by substituting the perplexity of the fingers for the perplexity of the brain and by substituting as he became more practised the ingenuity of the hands for the ingenuity of the mental torture that he has never been able to bear the thought of putting it quite out of his reach even now when i believe he is more hopeful of himself than he has ever been and even speaks of himself with a kind of confidence the idea that he might need that old employment and not find it gives him a sudden sense of terror like that which one may fancy strikes to the heart of a lost child he looked like his illustration as he raised his eyes to mr lorry s face but may not mind i ask for information as a plodding man of business who only deals with such material objects as guineas shillings and bank notes may not the retention of the thing involve the retention of the idea if the thing were gone my dear manette might not the fear go with it in short is it not a concession to the misgiving to keep the forge there was another silence you see too said the doctor tremulously it is such an old companion i would not keep it said mr lorry shaking his head for he gained in firmness as he saw the doctor disquieted i would recommend him to sacrifice it i only want your authority i am sure it does no good come give me your authority like a dear good man for his daughter s sake my dear manette very strange to see what a struggle there was within him in her name then let it be done i sanction it but i would not take it away while he was present let it be removed when he is not there let him miss his old companion after an absence mr lorry readily engaged for that and the conference was ended they passed the day in the country and the doctor was quite restored on the three following days he remained perfectly well and on the fourteenth day he went away to join lucie and her husband the precaution that had been taken to account for his silence mr lorry had previously explained to him and he had written to lucie in accordance with it and she had no suspicions on the night of the day on which he left the house mr lorry went into his room with a chopper saw chisel and hammer attended by miss pross carrying a light there with closed doors and in a mysterious and guilty manner mr lorry hacked the shoemaker s bench to pieces while miss pross held the candle as if she were assisting at a murder for which indeed in her grimness she was no unsuitable figure the burning of the body previously reduced to pieces convenient for the purpose was commenced without delay in the kitchen fire and the tools shoes and leather were buried in the garden so wicked do destruction and secrecy appear to honest minds that mr lorry and miss pross while engaged in the commission of their deed and in the removal of its traces almost felt and almost looked like accomplices in a horrible crime when the newly married pair came home the first person who appeared to offer his congratulations was sydney carton they had not been at home many hours when he presented himself he was not improved in habits or in looks or in manner but there was a certain rugged air of fidelity about him which was new to the observation of charles darnay he watched his opportunity of taking darnay aside into a window and of speaking to him when no one overheard mr darnay said carton i wish we might be friends we are already friends i hope you are good enough to say so as a fashion of speech but i don t mean any fashion of speech indeed when i say i wish we might be friends i scarcely mean quite that either charles darnay as was natural asked him in all good humour and good fellowship what he did mean upon my life said carton smiling i find that easier to comprehend in my own mind than to convey to yours however let me try you remember a certain famous occasion when i was more drunk than than usual i remember a certain famous occasion when you forced me to confess that you had been drinking i remember it too the curse of those occasions is heavy upon me for i always remember them i hope it may be taken into account one day when all days are at an end for me don t be alarmed i am not going to
