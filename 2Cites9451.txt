and stifled by the bunches of grass and straw that were thrust into his face by hundreds of hands torn bruised panting bleeding yet always entreating and beseeching for mercy now full of vehement agony of action with a small clear space about him as the people drew one another back that they might see now a log of dead wood drawn through a forest of legs he was hauled to the nearest street corner where one of the fatal lamps swung and there madame defarge let him go as a cat might have done to a mouse and silently and composedly looked at him while they made ready and while he besought her the women passionately screeching at him all the time and the men sternly calling out to have him killed with grass in his mouth once he went aloft and the rope broke and they caught him shrieking twice he went aloft and the rope broke and they caught him shrieking then the rope was merciful and held him and his head was soon upon a pike with grass enough in the mouth for all saint antoine to dance at the sight of nor was this the end of the day s bad work for saint antoine so shouted and danced his angry blood up that it boiled again on hearing when the day closed in that the son in law of the despatched another of the people s enemies and insulters was coming into paris under a guard five hundred strong in cavalry alone saint antoine wrote his crimes on flaring sheets of paper seized him would have torn him out of the breast of an army to bear foulon company set his head and heart on pikes and carried the three spoils of the day in wolf procession through the streets not before dark night did the men and women come back to the children wailing and breadless then the miserable bakers shops were beset by long files of them patiently waiting to buy bad bread and while they waited with stomachs faint and empty they beguiled the time by embracing one another on the triumphs of the day and achieving them again in gossip gradually these strings of ragged people shortened and frayed away and then poor lights began to shine in high windows and slender fires were made in the streets at which neighbours cooked in common afterwards supping at their doors scanty and insufficient suppers those and innocent of meat as of most other sauce to wretched bread yet human fellowship infused some nourishment into the flinty viands and struck some sparks of cheerfulness out of them fathers and mothers who had had their full share in the worst of the day played gently with their meagre children and lovers with such a world around them and before them loved and hoped it was almost morning when defarge s wine shop parted with its last knot of customers and monsieur defarge said to madame his wife in husky tones while fastening the door at last it is come my dear eh well returned madame almost saint antoine slept the defarges slept even the vengeance slept with her starved grocer and the drum was at rest the drum s was the only voice in saint antoine that blood and hurry had not changed the vengeance as custodian of the drum could have wakened him up and had the same speech out of him as before the bastille fell or old foulon was seized not so with the hoarse tones of the men and women in saint antoine s bosom there was a change on the village where the fountain fell and where the mender of roads went forth daily to hammer out of the stones on the highway such morsels of bread as might serve for patches to hold his poor ignorant soul and his poor reduced body together the prison on the crag was not so dominant as of yore there were soldiers to guard it but not many there were officers to guard the soldiers but not one of them knew what his men would do beyond this that it would probably not be what he was ordered far and wide lay a ruined country yielding nothing but desolation every green leaf every blade of grass and blade of grain was as shrivelled and poor as the miserable people everything was bowed down dejected oppressed and broken habitations fences domesticated animals men women children and the soil that bore them all worn out monseigneur often a most worthy individual gentleman was a national blessing gave a chivalrous tone to things was a polite example of luxurious and shining life and a great deal more to equal purpose nevertheless monseigneur as a class had somehow or other brought things to this strange that creation designed expressly for monseigneur should be so soon wrung dry and squeezed out there must be something short sighted in the eternal arrangements surely thus it was however and the last drop of blood having been extracted from the flints and the last screw of the rack having been turned so often that its purchase crumbled and it now turned and turned with nothing to bite monseigneur began to run away from a phenomenon so low and unaccountable but this was not the change on the village and on many a village like it for scores of years gone by monseigneur had squeezed it and wrung it and had seldom graced it with his presence except for the pleasures of the chase now found in hunting the people now found in hunting the beasts for whose preservation monseigneur made edifying spaces of barbarous and barren wilderness no the change consisted in the appearance of strange faces of low caste rather than in the disappearance of the high caste chiselled and otherwise beautified and beautifying features of monseigneur for in these times as the mender of roads worked solitary in the dust not often troubling himself to reflect that dust he was and to dust he must return being for the most part too much occupied in thinking how little he had for supper and how much more he would eat if he had it in these times as he raised his eyes from his lonely labour and viewed the prospect he would see some rough figure approaching on foot the like of which was once a rarity in those parts but was now a frequent presence as it advanced the mender of roads would discern without surprise that it was a shaggy haired man of almost barbarian aspect tall in wooden shoes that were clumsy even to the eyes of a mender of roads grim rough swart steeped in the mud and dust of many highways dank with the marshy moisture of many low grounds sprinkled with the thorns and leaves and moss of many byways through woods such a man came upon him like a ghost at noon in the july weather as he sat on his heap of stones under a bank taking such shelter as he could get from a shower of hail the man looked at him looked at the village in the hollow at the mill and at the prison on the crag when he had identified these objects in what benighted mind he had he said in a dialect that was just intelligible how goes it jacques all well jacques touch then they joined hands and the man sat down on the heap of stones no dinner nothing but supper now said the mender of roads with a hungry face it is the fashion growled the man i meet no dinner anywhere he took out a blackened pipe filled it lighted it with flint and steel pulled at it until it was in a bright glow then suddenly held it from him and dropped something into it from between his finger and thumb that blazed and went out in a puff of smoke touch then it was the turn of the mender of roads to say it this time after observing these operations they again joined hands to night said the mender of roads to night said the man putting the pipe in his mouth where here he and the mender of roads sat on the heap of stones looking silently at one another with the hail driving in between them like a pigmy charge of bayonets until the sky began to clear over the village show me said the traveller then moving to the brow of the hill see returned the mender of roads with extended finger you go down here and straight through the street and past the fountain to the devil with all that interrupted the other rolling his eye over the landscape i go through no streets and past no fountains well well about two leagues beyond the summit of that hill above the village good when do you cease to work at sunset will you wake me before departing i have walked two nights without resting let me finish my pipe and i shall sleep like a child will you wake me surely the wayfarer smoked his pipe out put it in his breast slipped off his great wooden shoes and lay down on his back on the heap of stones he was fast asleep directly as the road mender plied his dusty labour and the hail clouds rolling away revealed bright bars and streaks of sky which were responded to by silver gleams upon the landscape the little man who wore a red cap now in place of his blue one seemed fascinated by the figure on the heap of stones his eyes were so often turned towards it that he used his tools mechanically and one would have said to very poor account the bronze face the shaggy black hair and beard the coarse woollen red cap the rough medley dress of home spun stuff and hairy skins of beasts the powerful frame attenuated by spare living and the sullen and desperate compression of the lips in sleep inspired the mender of roads with awe the traveller had travelled far and his feet were footsore and his ankles chafed and bleeding his great shoes stuffed with leaves and grass had been heavy to drag over the many long leagues and his clothes were chafed into holes as he himself was into sores stooping down beside him the road mender tried to get a peep at secret weapons in his breast or where not but in vain for he slept with his arms crossed upon him and set as resolutely as his lips fortified towns with their stockades guard houses gates trenches and drawbridges seemed to the mender of roads to be so much air as against this figure and when he lifted his eyes from it to the horizon and looked around he saw in his small fancy similar figures stopped by no obstacle tending to centres all over france the man slept on indifferent to showers of hail and intervals of brightness to sunshine on his face and shadow to the paltering lumps of dull ice on his body and the diamonds into which the sun changed them until the sun was low in the west and the sky was glowing then the mender of roads having got his tools together and all things ready to go down into the village roused him good said the sleeper rising on his elbow two leagues beyond the summit of the hill about about good the mender of roads went home with the dust going on before him according to the set of the wind and was soon at the fountain squeezing himself in among the lean kine brought there to drink and appearing even to whisper to them in his whispering to all the village when the village had taken its poor supper it did not creep to bed as it usually did but came out of doors again and remained there a curious contagion of whispering was upon it and also when it gathered together at the fountain in the dark another curious contagion of looking expectantly at the sky in one direction only monsieur gabelle chief functionary of the place became uneasy went out on his house top alone and looked in that direction too glanced down from behind his chimneys at the darkening faces by the fountain below and sent word to the sacristan who kept the keys of the church that there might be need to ring the tocsin by and bye the night deepened the trees environing the old chateau keeping its solitary state apart moved in a rising wind as though they threatened the pile of building massive and dark in the gloom up the two terrace flights of steps the rain ran wildly and beat at the great door like a swift messenger rousing those within uneasy rushes of wind went through the hall among the old spears and knives and passed lamenting up the stairs and shook the curtains of the bed where the last marquis had slept east west north and south through the woods four heavy treading unkempt figures crushed the high grass and cracked the branches striding on cautiously to come together in the courtyard four lights broke out there and moved away in different directions and all was black again but not for long presently the chateau began to make itself strangely visible by some light of its own as though it were growing luminous then a flickering streak played behind the architecture of the front picking out transparent places and showing where balustrades arches and windows were then it soared higher and grew broader and brighter soon from a score of the great windows flames burst forth and the stone faces awakened stared out of fire a faint murmur arose about the house from the few people who were left there and there was a saddling of a horse and riding away there was spurring and splashing through the darkness and bridle was drawn in the space by the village fountain and the horse in a foam stood at monsieur gabelle s door help gabelle help every one the tocsin rang impatiently but other help if that were any there was none the mender of roads and two hundred and fifty particular friends stood with folded arms at the fountain looking at the pillar of fire in the sky it must be forty feet high said they grimly and never moved the rider from the chateau and the horse in a foam clattered away through the village and galloped up the stony steep to the prison on the crag at the gate a group of officers were looking at the fire removed from them a group of soldiers help gentlemen officers the chateau is on fire valuable objects may be saved from the flames by timely aid help help the officers looked towards the soldiers who looked at the fire gave no orders and answered with shrugs and biting of lips it must burn as the rider rattled down the hill again and through the street the village was illuminating the mender of roads and the two hundred and fifty particular friends inspired as one man and woman by the idea of lighting up had darted into their houses and were putting candles in every dull little pane of glass the general scarcity of everything occasioned candles to be borrowed in a rather peremptory manner of monsieur gabelle and in a moment of reluctance and hesitation on that functionary s part the mender of roads once so submissive to authority had remarked that carriages were good to make bonfires with and that post horses would roast the chateau was left to itself to flame and burn in the roaring and raging of the conflagration a red hot wind driving straight from the infernal regions seemed to be blowing the edifice away with the rising and falling of the blaze the stone faces showed as if they were in torment when great masses of stone and timber fell the face with the two dints in the nose became obscured anon struggled out of the smoke again as if it were the face of the cruel marquis burning at the stake and contending with the fire the chateau burned the nearest trees laid hold of by the fire scorched and shrivelled trees at a distance fired by the four fierce figures begirt the blazing edifice with a new forest of smoke molten lead and iron boiled in the marble basin of the fountain the water ran dry the extinguisher tops of the towers vanished like ice before the heat and trickled down into four rugged wells of flame great rents and splits branched out in the solid walls like crystallisation stupefied birds wheeled about and dropped into the furnace four fierce figures trudged away east west north and south along the night enshrouded roads guided by the beacon they had lighted towards their next destination the illuminated village had seized hold of the tocsin and abolishing the lawful ringer rang for joy not only that but the village light headed with famine fire and bell ringing and bethinking itself that monsieur gabelle had to do with the collection of rent and taxes though it was but a small instalment of taxes and no rent at all that gabelle had got in those latter days became impatient for an interview with him and surrounding his house summoned him to come forth for personal conference whereupon monsieur gabelle did heavily bar his door and retire to hold counsel with himself the result of that conference was that gabelle again withdrew himself to his housetop behind his stack of chimneys this time resolved if his door were broken in he was a small southern man of retaliative temperament to pitch himself head foremost over the parapet and crush a man or two below probably monsieur gabelle passed a long night up there with the distant chateau for fire and candle and the beating at his door combined with the joy ringing for music not to mention his having an ill omened lamp slung across the road before his posting house gate which the village showed a lively inclination to displace in his favour a trying suspense to be passing a whole summer night on the brink of the black ocean ready to take that plunge into it upon which monsieur gabelle had resolved but the friendly dawn appearing at last and the rush candles of the village guttering out the people happily dispersed and monsieur gabelle came down bringing his life with him for that while within a hundred miles and in the light of other fires there were other functionaries less fortunate that night and other nights whom the rising sun found hanging across once peaceful streets where they had been born and bred also there were other villagers and townspeople less fortunate than the mender of roads and his fellows upon whom the functionaries and soldiery turned with success and whom they strung up in their turn but the fierce figures were steadily wending east west north and south be that as it would and whosoever hung fire burned the altitude of the gallows that would turn to water and quench it no functionary by any stretch of mathematics was able to calculate successfully in such risings of fire and risings of sea the firm earth shaken by the rushes of an angry ocean which had now no ebb but was always on the flow higher and higher to the terror and wonder of the beholders on the shore three years of tempest were consumed three more birthdays of little lucie had been woven by the golden thread into the peaceful tissue of the life of her home many a night and many a day had its inmates listened to the echoes in the corner with hearts that failed them when they heard the thronging feet for the footsteps had become to their minds as the footsteps of a people tumultuous under a red flag and with their country declared in danger changed into wild beasts by terrible enchantment long persisted in monseigneur as a class had dissociated himself from the phenomenon of his not being appreciated of his being so little wanted in france as to incur considerable danger of receiving his dismissal from it and this life together like the fabled rustic who raised the devil with infinite pains and was so terrified at the sight of him that he could ask the enemy no question but immediately fled so monseigneur after boldly reading the lord s prayer backwards for a great number of years and performing many other potent spells for compelling the evil one no sooner beheld him in his terrors than he took to his noble heels the shining bull s eye of the court was gone or it would have been the mark for a hurricane of national bullets it had never been a good eye to see with had long had the mote in it of lucifer s pride sardanapalus s luxury and a mole s blindness but it had dropped out and was gone the court from that exclusive inner circle to its outermost rotten ring of intrigue corruption and dissimulation was all gone together royalty was gone had been besieged in its palace and suspended when the last tidings came over the august of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety two was come and monseigneur was by this time scattered far and wide as was natural the head quarters and great gathering place of monseigneur in london was tellson s bank spirits are supposed to haunt the places where their bodies most resorted and monseigneur without a guinea haunted the spot where his guineas used to be moreover it was the spot to which such french intelligence as was most to be relied upon came quickest again tellson s was a munificent house and extended great liberality to old customers who had fallen from their high estate again those nobles who had seen the coming storm in time and anticipating plunder or confiscation had made provident remittances to tellson s were always to be heard of there by their needy brethren to which it must be added that every new comer from france reported himself and his tidings at tellson s almost as a matter of course for such variety of reasons tellson s was at that time as to french intelligence a kind of high exchange and this was so well known to the public and the inquiries made there were in consequence so numerous that tellson s sometimes wrote the latest news out in a line or so and posted it in the bank windows for all who ran through temple bar to read on a steaming misty afternoon mr lorry sat at his desk and charles darnay stood leaning on it talking with him in a low voice the penitential den once set apart for interviews with the house was now the news exchange and was filled to overflowing it was within half an hour or so of the time of closing but although you are the youngest man that ever lived said charles darnay rather hesitating i must still suggest to you i understand that i am too old said mr lorry unsettled weather a long journey uncertain means of travelling a disorganised country a city that may not be even safe for you my dear charles said mr lorry with cheerful confidence you touch some of the reasons for my going not for my staying away it is safe enough for me nobody will care to interfere with an old fellow of hard upon fourscore when there are so many people there much better worth interfering with as to its being a disorganised city if it were not a disorganised city there would be no occasion to send somebody from our house here to our house there who knows the city and the business of old and is in tellson s confidence as to the uncertain travelling the long journey and the winter weather if i were not prepared to submit myself to a few inconveniences for the sake of tellson s after all these years who ought to be i wish i were going myself said charles darnay somewhat restlessly and like one thinking aloud indeed you are a pretty fellow to object and advise exclaimed mr lorry you wish you were going yourself and you a frenchman born you are a wise counsellor my dear mr lorry it is because i am a frenchman born that the thought which i did not mean to utter here however has passed through my mind often one cannot help thinking having had some sympathy for the miserable people and having abandoned something to them he spoke here in his former thoughtful manner that one might be listened to and might have the power to persuade to some restraint only last night after you had left us when i was talking to lucie when you were talking to lucie mr lorry repeated yes i wonder you are not ashamed to mention the name of lucie wishing you were going to france at this time of day however i am not going said charles darnay with a smile it is more to the purpose that you say you are and i am in plain reality the truth is my dear charles mr lorry glanced at the distant house and lowered his voice you can have no conception of the difficulty with which our business is transacted and of the peril in which our books and papers over yonder are involved the lord above knows what the compromising consequences would be to numbers of people if some of our documents were seized or destroyed and they might be at any time you know for who can say that paris is not set afire to day or sacked to morrow now a judicious selection from these with the least possible delay and the burying of them or otherwise getting of them out of harm s way is within the power without loss of precious time of scarcely any one but myself if any one and shall i hang back when tellson s knows this and says this tellson s whose bread i have eaten these sixty years because i am a little stiff about the joints why i am a boy sir to half a dozen old codgers here how i admire the gallantry of your youthful spirit mr lorry tut nonsense sir and my dear charles said mr lorry glancing at the house again you are to remember that getting things out of paris at this present time no matter what things is next to an impossibility papers and precious matters were this very day brought to us here i speak in strict confidence it is not business like to whisper it even to you by the strangest bearers you can imagine every one of whom had his head hanging on by a single hair as he passed the barriers at another time our parcels would come and go as easily as in business like old england but now everything is stopped and do you really go to night i really go to night for the case has become too pressing to admit of delay and do you take no one with you all sorts of people have been proposed to me but i will have nothing to say to any of them i intend to take jerry jerry has been my bodyguard on sunday nights for a long time past and i am used to him nobody will suspect jerry of being anything but an english bull dog or of having any design in his head but to fly at anybody who touches his master i must say again that i heartily admire your gallantry and youthfulness i must say again nonsense nonsense when i have executed this little commission i shall perhaps accept tellson s proposal to retire and live at my ease time enough then to think about growing old this dialogue had taken place at mr lorry s usual desk with monseigneur swarming within a yard or two of it boastful of what he would do to avenge himself on the rascal people before long it was too much the way of monseigneur under his reverses as a refugee and it was much too much the way of native british orthodoxy to talk of this terrible revolution as if it were the only harvest ever known under the skies that had not been sown as if nothing had ever been done or omitted to be done that had led to it as if observers of the wretched millions in france and of the misused and perverted resources that should have made them prosperous had not seen it inevitably coming years before and had not in plain words recorded what they saw such vapouring combined with the extravagant plots of monseigneur for the restoration of a state of things that had utterly exhausted itself and worn out heaven and earth as well as itself was hard to be endured without some remonstrance by any sane man who knew the truth and it was such vapouring all about his ears like a troublesome confusion of blood in his own head added to a latent uneasiness in his mind which had already made charles darnay restless and which still kept him so among the talkers was stryver of the king s bench bar far on his way to state promotion and therefore loud on the theme broaching to monseigneur his devices for blowing the people up and exterminating them from the face of the earth and doing without them and for accomplishing many similar objects akin in their nature to the abolition of eagles by sprinkling salt on the tails of the race him darnay heard with a particular feeling of objection and darnay stood divided between going away that he might hear no more and remaining to interpose his word when the thing that was to be went on to shape itself out the house approached mr lorry and laying a soiled and unopened letter before him asked if he had yet discovered any traces of the person to whom it was addressed the house laid the letter down so close to darnay that he saw the direction the more quickly because it was his own right name the address turned into english ran very pressing to monsieur heretofore the marquis st evremonde of france confided to the cares of messrs tellson and co bankers london england on the marriage morning doctor manette had made it his one urgent and express request to charles darnay that the secret of this name should be unless he the doctor dissolved the obligation kept inviolate between them nobody else knew it to be his name his own wife had no
