1,does it seem incongruous to you that a surgeon should dream of himself as a discoverer most of us indeed know little of the great originators until they have been lifted up among the constellations and already rule our fates but that for example who broke the barriers of the heavens did he not once play a provincial church organ and give music lessons to stumbling pianists each of those shining ones had to walk on the earth among neighbors who perhaps thought much more of his gait and his garments than of anything which was to give him a title to everlasting fame each of them had his little local personal history sprinkled with small temptations and sordid cares which made the retarding friction of his course towards final companionship with the immortals was not blind to the dangers of such friction but he had plenty of confidence in his resolution to avoid it as far as possible being seven and twenty he felt himself experienced and he was not going to have his vanities provoked by contact with the showy worldly successes of the capital but to live among people who could hold no rivalry with that pursuit of a great idea which was to be a twin object with the assiduous practice of his profession there was fascination in the hope that the two purposes would illuminate each other the careful observation and inference which was his daily work the use of the lens to further his judgment in special cases would further his thought as an instrument of larger inquiry was not this the typical pre eminence of his profession he would be a good doctor and by that very means keep himself in the track of far reaching investigation on one point he may fairly claim approval at this particular stage of his career he did not mean to imitate those philanthropic models who make a profit out of poisonous pickles to support themselves while they are exposing adulteration or hold shares in a gambling hell that they may have leisure to represent the cause of public morality he intended to begin in his own case some particular reforms which were quite certainly within his reach and much less of a problem than the demonstrating of an anatomical conception one of these reforms was to act stoutly on the strength of a recent legal decision and simply prescribe without dispensing drugs or taking percentage from druggists this was an innovation for one who had chosen to adopt the style of general practitioner in a country town and would be felt as offensive criticism by his professional brethren but meant to innovate in his treatment also and he was wise enough to see that the best security for his practising honestly according to his belief was to get rid of systematic temptations to the contrary perhaps that was a more cheerful time for observers and theorizers than the present we are apt to think it the finest era of the world when was beginning to be discovered when a bold sailor even if he were wrecked might alight on a new kingdom and about the dark territories of pathology were a fine for a spirited young adventurer was ambitious above all to contribute towards enlarging the scientific rational basis of his profession the more he became interested in special questions of disease such as the nature of fever or fevers the more keenly he felt the need for that fundamental knowledge of structure which just at the beginning of the century had been illuminated by the brief and glorious career of who died when he was only one and thirty but like another alexander left a realm large enough for many heirs that great frenchman first carried out the conception that living bodies fundamentally considered are not associations of organs which can be understood by studying them first apart and then as it were federally but must be regarded as consisting of certain primary webs or tissues out of which the various organs brain heart lungs and so on are compacted as the various accommodations of a house are built up in various proportions of wood iron stone brick zinc and the rest each material having its peculiar composition and proportions no man one sees can understand and estimate the entire structure or its parts what are its frailties and what its repairs without knowing the nature of the materials and the conception wrought out by with his detailed study of the different tissues acted necessarily on medical questions as the turning of gas light would act on a dim oil lit street showing new connections and hitherto hidden facts of structure which must be taken into account in considering the symptoms of maladies and the action of medicaments but results which depend on human conscience and intelligence work slowly and now at the end of most medical practice was still strutting or shambling along the old paths and there was still scientific work to be done which might have seemed to be a direct sequence of s this great seer did not go beyond the consideration of the tissues as ultimate facts in the living organism marking the limit of anatomical analysis but it was open to another mind to say have not these structures some common basis from which they have all started as your sarsnet gauze net satin and velvet from the raw cocoon here would be another light as of oxy hydrogen showing the very grain of things and revising all former explanations of this sequence to s work already vibrating along many currents of the european mind was enamoured he longed to demonstrate the more intimate relations of living structure and help to define men s thought more accurately after the true order the work had not yet been done but only prepared for those who knew how to use the preparation what was the primitive tissue in that way put the question not quite in the way required by the awaiting answer but such missing of the right word befalls many seekers and he counted on quiet intervals to be watchfully seized for taking up the threads of investigation on many hints to be won from diligent application not only of the scalpel but of the microscope which research had begun to use again with new enthusiasm of reliance such was s plan of his future to do good small work for and great work for the world he was certainly a happy fellow at this time to be seven and twenty without any fixed vices with a generous resolution that his action should be beneficent and with ideas in his brain that made life interesting quite apart from the cultus of horseflesh and other mystic rites of costly observance which the eight hundred pounds left him after buying his practice would certainly not have gone far in paying for he was at a starting point which makes many a man s career a fine subject for betting if there were any gentlemen given to that amusement who could appreciate the complicated probabilities of an arduous purpose with all the possible thwartings and furtherings of circumstance all the niceties of inward balance by which a man swims and makes his point or else is carried headlong the risk would remain even with close knowledge of s character for character too is a process and an unfolding the man was still in the making as much as the doctor and immortal discoverer and there were both virtues and faults capable of shrinking or expanding the faults will not i hope be a reason for the withdrawal of your interest in him among our valued friends is there not some one or other who is a little too self confident and disdainful whose distinguished mind is a little spotted with commonness who is a little pinched here and protuberant there with native prejudices or whose better energies are liable to lapse down the wrong channel under the influence of transient solicitations all these things might be alleged against but then they are the periphrases of a polite preacher who talks of and would not like to mention anything painful to the pew renters the particular faults from which these delicate generalities are distilled have distinguishable physiognomies diction accent and grimaces filling up parts in very various dramas our vanities differ as our noses do all conceit is not the same conceit but varies in correspondence with the minutiae of mental make in which one of us differs from another s conceit was of the arrogant sort never simpering never impertinent but massive in its claims and benevolently contemptuous he would do a great deal for noodles being sorry for them and feeling quite sure that they could have no power over him he had thought of joining the when he was in in order to turn them against some of their own doctrines all his faults were marked by kindred traits and were those of a man who had a fine baritone whose clothes hung well upon him and who even in his ordinary gestures had an air of inbred distinction where then lay the spots of commonness says a young lady enamoured of that careless grace how could there be any commonness in a man so well bred so ambitious of social distinction so generous and unusual in his views of social duty as easily as there may be stupidity in a man of genius if you take him unawares on the wrong subject or as many a man who has the best will to advance the social millennium might be ill inspired in imagining its lighter pleasures unable to go beyond s music or the brilliant punning in the last burlesque s spots of commonness lay in the complexion of his prejudices which in spite of noble intention and sympathy were half of them such as are found in ordinary men of the world that distinction of mind which belonged to his intellectual ardor did not penetrate his feeling and judgment about furniture or women or the desirability of its being known without his telling that he was better born than other country surgeons he did not mean to think of furniture at present but whenever he did so it was to be feared that neither biology nor schemes of reform would lift him above the vulgarity of feeling that there would be an incompatibility in his furniture not being of the best as to women he had once already been drawn headlong by impetuous folly which he meant to be final since marriage at some distant period would of course not be impetuous for those who want to be acquainted with it will be good to know what was that case of impetuous folly for it may stand as an example of the fitful swerving of passion to which he was prone together with the chivalrous kindness which helped to make him morally lovable the story can be told without many words it happened when he was studying in and just at the time when over and above his other work he was occupied with some galvanic experiments one evening tired with his experimenting and not being able to elicit the facts he needed he left his frogs and rabbits to some repose under their trying and mysterious dispensation of unexplained shocks and went to finish his evening at the theatre of the where there was a melodrama which he had already seen several times attracted not by the ingenious work of the collaborating authors but by an actress whose part it was to stab her lover mistaking him for the evil designing duke of the piece was in love with this actress as a man is in love with a woman whom he never expects to speak to she was a provencale with dark eyes a greek profile and rounded majestic form having that sort of beauty which carries a sweet matronliness even in youth and her voice was a soft cooing she had but lately come to and bore a virtuous reputation her husband acting with her as the unfortunate lover it was her acting which was no better than it should be but the public was satisfied s only relaxation now was to go and look at this woman just as he might have thrown himself under the breath of the sweet south on a bank of violets for a while without prejudice to his galvanism to which he would presently return but this evening the old drama had a new catastrophe at the moment when the heroine was to act the stabbing of her lover and he was to fall gracefully the wife veritably stabbed her husband who fell as death willed a wild shriek pierced the house and the provencale fell swooning a shriek and a swoon were demanded by the play but the swooning too was real this time leaped and climbed he hardly knew how on to the stage and was active in help making the acquaintance of his heroine by finding a contusion on her head and lifting her gently in his arms rang with the story of this death was it a murder some of the actress s warmest admirers were inclined to believe in her guilt and liked her the better for it such was the taste of those times but was not one of these he vehemently contended for her innocence and the remote impersonal passion for her beauty which he had felt before had passed now into personal devotion and tender thought of her lot the notion of murder was absurd no motive was discoverable the young couple being understood to dote on each other and it was not unprecedented that an accidental slip of the foot should have brought these grave consequences the legal investigation ended in s release by this time had had many interviews with her and found her more and more adorable she talked little but that was an additional charm she was melancholy and seemed grateful her presence was enough like that of the evening light was madly anxious about her affection and jealous lest any other man than himself should win it and ask her to marry him but instead of reopening her engagement at the where she would have been all the more popular for the fatal episode she left without warning forsaking her little court of admirers perhaps no one carried inquiry far except who felt that all science had come to a stand still while he imagined the unhappy stricken by ever wandering sorrow herself wandering and finding no faithful comforter hidden actresses however are not so difficult to find as some other hidden facts and it was not long before gathered indications that had taken the route to he found her at last acting with great success at under the same name looking more majestic than ever as a forsaken wife carrying her child in her arms he spoke to her after the play was received with the usual quietude which seemed to him beautiful as clear depths of water and obtained leave to visit her the next day when he was bent on telling her that he adored her and on asking her to marry him he knew that this was like the sudden impulse of a madman incongruous even with his habitual foibles no matter it was the one thing which he was resolved to do he had two selves within him apparently and they must learn to accommodate each other and bear reciprocal impediments strange that some of us with quick alternate vision see beyond our infatuations and even while we rave on the heights behold the wide plain where our persistent self pauses and awaits us to have approached with any suit that was not reverentially tender would have been simply a contradiction of his whole feeling towards her you have come all the way from to find me she said to him the next day sitting before him with folded arms and looking at him with eyes that seemed to wonder as an untamed ruminating animal wonders are all englishmen like that i came because i could not live without trying to see you you are lonely i love you i want you to consent to be my wife i will wait but i want you to promise that you will marry me no one else looked at him in silence with a melancholy radiance from under her grand eyelids until he was full of rapturous certainty and knelt close to her knees i will tell you something she said in her cooing way keeping her arms folded my foot really slipped i know i know said deprecatingly it was a fatal accident a dreadful stroke of calamity that bound me to you the more again paused a little and then said slowly i meant to do it strong man as he was turned pale and trembled moments seemed to pass before he rose and stood at a distance from her there was a secret then he said at last even vehemently he was brutal to you you hated him no he wearied me he was too fond he would live in and not in my country that was not agreeable to me great god said in a groan of horror and you planned to murder him i did not plan it came to me in the play i meant to do it stood mute and unconsciously pressed his hat on while he looked at her he saw this woman the first to whom he had given his young adoration amid the throng of stupid criminals you are a good young man she said but i do not like husbands i will never have another three days afterwards was at his galvanism again in his chambers believing that illusions were at an end for him he was saved from hardening effects by the abundant kindness of his heart and his belief that human life might be made better but he had more reason than ever for trusting his judgment now that it was so experienced and henceforth he would take a strictly scientific view of woman entertaining no expectations but such as were justified beforehand no one in was likely to have such a notion of s past as has here been faintly shadowed and indeed the respectable townsfolk there were not more given than mortals generally to any eager attempt at exactness in the representation to themselves of what did not come under their own senses not only young virgins of that town but gray bearded men also were often in haste to conjecture how a new acquaintance might be wrought into their purposes contented with very vague knowledge as to the way in which life had been shaping him for that instrumentality in fact counted on swallowing and assimilating him very comfortably the question whether should be appointed as salaried chaplain to the hospital was an exciting topic to the ers and heard it discussed in a way that threw much light on the power exercised in the town by the banker was evidently a ruler but there was an opposition party and even among his supporters there were some who allowed it to be seen that their support was a compromise and who frankly stated their impression that the general scheme of things and especially the casualties of trade required you to hold a candle to the devil s power was not due simply to his being a country banker who knew the financial secrets of most traders in the town and could touch the springs of their credit it was fortified by a beneficence that was at once ready and severe ready to confer obligations and severe in watching the result he had gathered as an industrious man always at his post a chief share in administering the town charities and his private charities were both minute and abundant he would take a great deal of pains about apprenticing the shoemaker s son and he would watch over s church going he would defend the washerwoman against s unjust exaction on the score of her drying ground and he would himself scrutinize a calumny against his private minor loans were numerous but he would inquire strictly into the circumstances both before and after in this way a man gathers a domain in his neighbors hope and fear as well as gratitude and power when once it has got into that subtle region propagates itself spreading out of all proportion to its external means it was a principle with to gain as much power as possible that he might use it for the glory of god he went through a great deal of spiritual conflict and inward argument in order to adjust his motives and make clear to himself what god s glory required but as we have seen his motives were not always rightly appreciated there were many crass minds in whose reflective scales could only weigh things in the lump and they had a strong suspicion that since could not enjoy life in their fashion eating and drinking so little as he did and worreting himself about everything he must have a sort of vampire s feast in the sense of mastery the subject of the chaplaincy came up at s table when was dining there and the family connection with did not he observed prevent some freedom of remark even on the part of the host himself though his reasons against the proposed arrangement turned entirely on his objection to s sermons which were all doctrine and his preference for whose sermons were free from that taint liked well enough the notion of the chaplain s having a salary supposing it were given to who was as good a little fellow as ever breathed and the best preacher anywhere and companionable too what line shall you take then said the coroner a great coursing comrade of s oh i m precious glad i m not one of the directors now i shall vote for referring the matter to the directors and the medical board together i shall roll some of my responsibility on your shoulders doctor said glancing first at the senior physician of the town and then at who sat opposite you medical gentlemen must consult which sort of black draught you will prescribe eh i know little of either said but in general appointments are apt to be made too much a question of personal liking the fittest man for a particular post is not always the best fellow or the most agreeable sometimes if you wanted to get a reform your only way would be to pension off the good fellows whom everybody is fond of and put them out of the question who was considered the physician of most weight though was usually said to have more penetration divested his large heavy face of all expression and looked at his wine glass while was speaking whatever was not problematical and suspected about this young man for example a certain showiness as to foreign ideas and a disposition to unsettle what had been settled and forgotten by his elders was positively unwelcome to a physician whose standing had been fixed thirty years before by a treatise on of which at least one copy marked own was bound in calf for my part i have some fellow feeling with one s self satisfaction is an untaxed kind of property which it is very unpleasant to find deprecated s remark however did not meet the sense of the company said that if he could have his way he would not put disagreeable fellows anywhere hang your reforms said there s no greater humbug in the
2,oh you know well what your advantages are you know that our young men here cannot cope with you where you frequent a house it may militate very much against a girl s making a desirable settlement in life and prevent her from accepting offers even if they are made was less flattered by his advantage over the than he was annoyed by the perception of s meaning she felt that she had spoken as impressively as it was necessary to do and that in using the superior word militate she had thrown a noble drapery over a mass of particulars which were still evident enough was fuming a little pushed his hair back with one hand felt curiously in his waistcoat pocket with the other and then stooped to beckon the tiny black spaniel which had the insight to decline his hollow caresses it would not have been decent to go away because he had been dining with other guests and had just taken tea but having no doubt that she had been understood turned the conversation s proverbs i think have omitted to say that as the sore palate findeth grit so an uneasy consciousness heareth innuendoes the next day parting from in the street supposed that they should meet at s in the evening answered curtly no he had work to do he must give up going out in the evening what you are going to get lashed to the mast eh and are stopping your ears said the vicar well if you don t mean to be won by the sirens you are right to take precautions in time a few days before would have taken no notice of these words as anything more than the vicar s usual way of putting things they seemed now to convey an innuendo which confirmed the impression that he had been making a fool of himself and behaving so as to be misunderstood not he believed by herself she he felt sure took everything as lightly as he intended it she had an exquisite tact and insight in relation to all points of manners but the people she lived among were blunderers and busybodies however the mistake should go no farther he resolved and kept his resolution that he would not go to s except on business became very unhappy the uneasiness first stirred by her aunt s questions grew and grew till at the end of ten days that she had not seen it grew into terror at the blank that might possibly come into foreboding of that ready fatal sponge which so cheaply wipes out the hopes of mortals the world would have a new dreariness for her as a wilderness that a magician s spells had turned for a little while into a garden she felt that she was beginning to know the pang of disappointed love and that no other man could be the occasion of such delightful aerial building as she had been enjoying for the last six months poor lost her appetite and felt as forlorn as as a charming stage left behind with all her boxes full of costumes and no hope of a coach there are many wonderful mixtures in the world which are all alike called love and claim the privileges of a sublime rage which is an apology for everything in literature and the drama happily did not think of committing any desperate act she plaited her fair hair as beautifully as usual and kept herself proudly calm her most cheerful supposition was that her aunt had interfered in some way to hinder s visits everything was better than a spontaneous indifference in him any one who imagines ten days too short a time not for falling into leanness lightness or other measurable effects of passion but for the whole spiritual circuit of alarmed conjecture and disappointment is ignorant of what can go on in the elegant leisure of a young lady s mind on the eleventh day however when leaving was requested by to let her husband know that there was a marked change in s health and that she wished him to come to on that day now might have called at the warehouse or might have written a message on a leaf of his pocket book and left it at the door yet these simple devices apparently did not occur to him from which we may conclude that he had no strong objection to calling at the house at an hour when was not at home and leaving the message with a man may from various motives decline to give his company but perhaps not even a sage would be gratified that nobody missed him it would be a graceful easy way of piecing on the new habits to the old to have a few playful words with about his resistance to dissipation and his firm resolve to take long fasts even from sweet sounds it must be confessed also that momentary speculations as to all the possible grounds for s hints had managed to get woven like slight clinging hairs into the more substantial web of his thoughts was alone and blushed so deeply when came in that he felt a corresponding embarrassment and instead of any playfulness he began at once to speak of his reason for calling and to beg her almost formally to deliver the message to her father who at the first moment felt as if her happiness were returning was keenly hurt by s manner her blush had departed and she assented coldly without adding an unnecessary word some trivial chain work which she had in her hands enabling her to avoid looking at higher than his chin in all failures the beginning is certainly the half of the whole after sitting two long moments while he moved his whip and could say nothing rose to go and made nervous by her struggle between mortification and the wish not to betray it dropped her chain as if startled and rose too mechanically instantaneously stooped to pick up the chain when he rose he was very near to a lovely little face set on a fair long neck which he had been used to see turning about under the most perfect management of self contented grace but as he raised his eyes now he saw a certain helpless quivering which touched him quite newly and made him look at with a questioning flash at this moment she was as natural as she had ever been when she was five years old she felt that her tears had risen and it was no use to try to do anything else than let them stay like water on a blue flower or let them fall over her cheeks even as they would that moment of naturalness was the crystallizing feather touch it shook flirtation into love remember that the ambitious man who was looking at those forget me nots under the water was very warm hearted and rash he did not know where the chain went an idea had thrilled through the recesses within him which had a miraculous effect in raising the power of passionate love lying buried there in no sealed sepulchre but under the lightest easily pierced mould his words were quite abrupt and awkward but the tone made them sound like an ardent appealing avowal what is the matter you are distressed tell me pray had never been spoken to in such tones before i am not sure that she knew what the words were but she looked at and the tears fell over her cheeks there could have been no more complete answer than that silence and forgetting everything else completely mastered by the outrush of tenderness at the sudden belief that this sweet young creature depended on him for her joy actually put his arms round her folding her gently and protectingly he was used to being gentle with the weak and suffering and kissed each of the two large tears this was a strange way of arriving at an understanding but it was a short way was not angry but she moved backward a little in timid happiness and could now sit near her and speak less incompletely had to make her little confession and he poured out words of gratitude and tenderness with impulsive lavishment in half an hour he left the house an engaged man whose soul was not his own but the woman s to whom he had bound himself he came again in the evening to speak with who just returned from was feeling sure that it would not be long before he heard of s demise the felicitous word demise which had seasonably occurred to him had raised his spirits even above their usual evening pitch the right word is always a power and communicates its definiteness to our action considered as a demise old s death assumed a merely legal aspect so that could tap his snuff box over it and be jovial without even an intermittent affectation of solemnity and hated both solemnity and affectation who was ever awe struck about a testator or sang a hymn on the title to real property was inclined to take a jovial view of all things that evening he even observed to that had got the family constitution after all and would soon be as fine a fellow as ever again and when his approbation of s engagement was asked for he gave it with astonishing facility passing at once to general remarks on the desirableness of matrimony for young men and maidens and apparently deducing from the whole the appropriateness of a little more punch the triumphant confidence of the mayor founded on s insistent demand that and his mother should not leave him was a feeble emotion compared with all that was agitating the breasts of the old man s blood relations who naturally manifested more their sense of the family tie and were more visibly numerous now that he had become bedridden naturally for when poor had occupied his arm chair in the wainscoted parlor no assiduous beetles for whom the cook prepares boiling water could have been less welcome on a hearth which they had reasons for preferring than those persons whose blood was ill nourished not from penuriousness on their part but from poverty brother and sister were rich and the family candor and total abstinence from false politeness with which they were always received seemed to them no argument that their brother in the solemn act of making his will would overlook the superior claims of wealth themselves at least he had never been unnatural enough to banish from his house and it seemed hardly eccentric that he should have kept away brother sister and the rest who had no shadow of such claims they knew s maxim that money was a good egg and should be laid in a warm nest but brother sister and all the needy exiles held a different point of view probabilities are as various as the faces to be seen at will in fretwork or paper hangings every form is there from to if you only look with creative inclination to the poorer and least favored it seemed likely that since had done nothing for them in his life he would remember them at the last argued that men liked to make a surprise of their wills while said that nobody need be surprised if he left the best part of his money to those who least expected it also it was not to be thought but that an own brother lying there with dropsy in his legs must come to feel that blood was thicker than water and if he didn t alter his will he might have money by him at any rate some blood relations should be on the premises and on the watch against those who were hardly relations at all such things had been known as forged wills and disputed wills which seemed to have the golden hazy advantage of somehow enabling non legatees to live out of them again those who were no blood relations might be caught making away with things and poor lying there helpless somebody should be on the watch but in this conclusion they were at one with and also some nephews nieces and cousins arguing with still greater subtilty as to what might be done by a man able to will away his property and give himself large treats of oddity felt in a handsome sort of way that there was a family interest to be attended to and thought of as a place which it would be nothing but right for them to visit sister otherwise living with some wheeziness in the chalky flats could not undertake the journey but her son as being poor s own nephew could represent her advantageously and watch lest his uncle should make an unfair use of the improbable things which seemed likely to happen in fact there was a general sense running in the blood that everybody must watch everybody else and that it would be well for everybody else to reflect that the almighty was watching him thus continually saw one or other blood relation alighting or departing and had the unpleasant task of carrying their messages to who would see none of them and sent her down with the still more unpleasant task of telling them so as manager of the household she felt bound to ask them in good provincial fashion to stay and eat but she chose to consult on the point of extra down stairs consumption now that was laid up oh my dear you must do things handsomely where there s last illness and a property god knows i don t grudge them every ham in the house only save the best for the funeral have some stuffed veal always and a fine cheese in cut you must expect to keep open house in these last illnesses said liberal once more of cheerful note and bright plumage but some of the visitors alighted and did not depart after the handsome treating to veal and ham brother for example there are such unpleasant people in most families perhaps even in the highest aristocracy there are specimens gigantically in debt and bloated at greater expense brother i say having come down in the world was mainly supported by a calling which he was modest enough not to boast of though it was much better than swindling either on exchange or turf but which did not require his presence at brassing so long as he had a good corner to sit in and a supply of food he chose the kitchen corner partly because he liked it best and partly because he did not want to sit with concerning whom he had a strong brotherly opinion seated in a famous arm chair and in his best suit constantly within sight of good cheer he had a comfortable consciousness of being on the premises mingled with fleeting suggestions of sunday and the bar at the green man and he informed that he should not go out of reach of his brother while that poor fellow was above ground the troublesome ones in a family are usually either the wits or the idiots was the wit among the s and joked with the maid servants when they came about the hearth but seemed to consider a suspicious character and followed her with cold eyes would have borne this one pair of eyes with comparative ease but unfortunately there was young who having come all the way from the chalky flats to represent his mother and watch his uncle also felt it his duty to stay and to sit chiefly in the kitchen to give his uncle company young was not exactly the balancing point between the wit and the idiot verging slightly towards the latter type and squinting so as to leave everything in doubt about his sentiments except that they were not of a forcible character when entered the kitchen and began to follow her with his cold detective eyes young turning his head in the same direction seemed to insist on it that she should remark how he was squinting as if he did it with design like the gypsies when borrow read the new testament to them this was rather too much for poor sometimes it made her bilious sometimes it upset her gravity one day that she had an opportunity she could not resist describing the kitchen scene to who would not be hindered from immediately going to see it affecting simply to pass through but no sooner did he face the four eyes than he had to rush through the nearest door which happened to lead to the dairy and there under the high roof and among the pans he gave way to laughter which made a hollow resonance perfectly audible in the kitchen he fled by another doorway but who had not before seen s white complexion long legs and pinched delicacy of face prepared many sarcasms in which these points of appearance were wittily combined with the lowest moral attributes why you don t wear such gentlemanly trousers you haven t got half such fine long legs said to his nephew winking at the same time to imply that there was something more in these statements than their undeniableness looked at his legs but left it uncertain whether he preferred his moral advantages to a more vicious length of limb and reprehensible gentility of trouser in the large wainscoted parlor too there were constantly pairs of eyes on the watch and own relatives eager to be sitters up many came lunched and departed but brother and the lady who had been for twenty five years before she was found it good to be there every day for hours without other calculable occupation than that of observing the cunning who was so deep that she could be found out in nothing and giving occasional dry wrinkly indications of crying as if capable of torrents in a wetter season at the thought that they were not allowed to go into s room for the old man s dislike of his own family seemed to get stronger as he got less able to amuse himself by saying biting things to them too languid to sting he had the more venom refluent in his blood not fully believing the message sent through they had presented themselves together within the door of the bedroom both in black having a white handkerchief partially unfolded in her hand and both with faces in a sort of half mourning purple while with her pink cheeks and pink ribbons flying was actually administering a cordial to their own brother and the light complexioned his short hair curling as might be expected in a gambler s was lolling at his ease in a large chair old no sooner caught sight of these funereal figures appearing in spite of his orders than rage came to strengthen him more successfully than the cordial he was propped up on a bed rest and always had his gold headed stick lying by him he seized it now and swept it backwards and forwards in as large an area as he could apparently to ban these ugly spectres crying in a hoarse sort of screech back back back oh brother began but put his hand before her repressingly he was a large cheeked man nearly seventy with small furtive eyes and was not only of much blander temper but thought himself much deeper than his brother indeed not likely to be deceived in any of his fellow men inasmuch as they could not well be more greedy and deceitful than he suspected them of being even the invisible powers he thought were likely to be soothed by a bland parenthesis here and there coming from a man of property who might have been as impious as others brother he said in a wheedling yet gravely official tone it s nothing but right i should speak to you about the three crofts and the manganese the almighty knows what i ve got on my mind then he knows more than i want to know said laying down his stick with a show of truce which had a threat in it too for he reversed the stick so as to make the gold handle a club in case of closer fighting and looked hard at s bald head there s things you might repent of brother for want of speaking to me said not advancing however i could sit up with you to night and with me willingly and you might take your own time to speak or let me speak yes i shall take my own time you needn t offer me yours said but you can t take your own time to die in brother began with her usual woolly tone and when you lie speechless you may be tired of having strangers about you and you may think of me and my children but here her voice broke under the touching thought which she was attributing to her speechless brother the mention of ourselves being naturally affecting no i shan t said old contradictiously i shan t think of any of you i ve made my will i tell you i ve made my will here he turned his head towards and swallowed some more of his cordial some people would be ashamed to fill up a place belonging by rights to others said turning her narrow eyes in the same direction oh sister said with ironical softness you and me are not fine and handsome and clever enough we must be humble and let smart people push themselves before us s spirit could not bear this rising and looking at he said shall my mother and i leave the room sir that you may be alone with your friends sit down i tell you said old snappishly stop where you are good by he added trying to wield his stick again but failing now that he had reversed the handle good by don t you come again i shall be down stairs brother whether or no said i shall do my duty and it remains to be seen what the almighty will allow yes in property going out of families said in continuation and where there s steady young men to carry on but i pity them who are not such and i pity their mothers good by brother remember i m the eldest after you brother and prospered from the first just as you did and have got land already by the name of said relying much on that reflection as one which might be suggested in the watches of the night but i bid you good by for the present their exit was hastened by their seeing old pull his wig on each side and shut his eyes with his mouth widening grimace as if he were determined to be deaf and blind none the less they came to daily and sat below at the post of duty sometimes carrying on a slow dialogue in an undertone in which the observation and response were so far apart that any one hearing them might have imagined himself listening to speaking automata in some doubt whether the ingenious mechanism would really work or wind itself up for a long time in order to stick and be silent and would have been sorry to be quick what that led to might be seen on the other side of the wall in the person of brother but their watch in the wainscoted parlor was sometimes varied by the presence of other guests from far or near now that was up stairs his property could be discussed with all that local enlightenment to be found on the spot some rural and neighbors expressed much agreement with the family and sympathy with their interest against the s and feminine visitors were even moved to tears in conversation with when they recalled the fact that they themselves had been disappointed in times past by codicils and marriages for spite on the part of ungrateful elderly gentlemen who it might have been supposed had been spared for something better such conversation paused suddenly like an organ when the bellows are let drop if came into the room and all eyes were turned on her as a possible legatee or one who might get access to iron chests but the younger men who were relatives or connections of the family were disposed to admire her in this problematic light as a girl who showed much conduct and who among all the chances that were flying might turn out to be at least a moderate prize hence she had her share of compliments and polite attentions especially from a distinguished bachelor and auctioneer of those parts much concerned in the sale of land and cattle a public character indeed whose name was seen on widely distributed placards and who might reasonably be sorry for those who did not know of him he was second cousin to and had been treated by him with more amenity than any other relative being useful in matters of business and in that programme of his funeral which the old man had himself dictated he had been named as a bearer there was no odious cupidity in nothing more than a sincere sense of his own merit which he was aware in case of rivalry might tell against competitors so that if who so far as he was concerned had behaved like as good a soul as ever breathed should have done anything handsome by him all he could say was that he had never fished and fawned but had advised him to the best of his experience which now extended over twenty years from the time of his apprenticeship at fifteen and was likely to yield a knowledge of no surreptitious kind his admiration was far from being confined to himself but was accustomed professionally as well as privately to delight in estimating things at a high rate he was an amateur of superior phrases and never used poor language without immediately correcting himself which was fortunate as he was rather loud and given to predominate standing or walking about frequently pulling down his waistcoat with the air of a man who is very much of his own opinion trimming himself rapidly with his fore finger and marking each new series in these movements by a busy play with his large seals there was occasionally a little fierceness in his demeanor but it was directed chiefly against false opinion of which there is so much to correct in the world that a man of some reading and experience necessarily has his patience tried he felt that the family generally was of limited understanding but being a man of the world and a public character took everything as a matter of course and even went to converse with and young in the kitchen not doubting that he had impressed the latter greatly by his leading questions concerning the chalky flats if anybody had observed that being an auctioneer was bound to know the nature of everything he would have smiled and trimmed himself silently with the sense that he came pretty near that on the whole in an auctioneering way he was an honorable man not ashamed of his business and feeling that the celebrated now if introduced to him would not fail to recognize his importance i don t mind if i have a slice of that ham and a glass of that ale if you will allow me he said coming into the parlor at half past eleven after having had the exceptional privilege of seeing old and standing with his back to the fire between and it s not necessary for you to go out let me ring the bell thank you said i have an errand well you re highly favored said what seeing the old man said the auctioneer playing with his seals dispassionately ah you see he has relied on me considerably here he pressed his lips together and frowned meditatively might anybody ask what their brother has been saying said in a soft tone of humility in which he had a sense of luxurious cunning he being a rich man and not in need of it oh yes anybody may ask said with loud and good humored though cutting sarcasm anybody may interrogate any one may give their remarks an interrogative turn he continued his sonorousness rising with his style this is constantly done by good speakers even when they anticipate no answer it is what we call a figure of speech speech at a high figure as one may say the eloquent auctioneer smiled at his own ingenuity i shouldn t be sorry to hear he d remembered you said i never was against the deserving it s the undeserving i m against ah there it is you see there it is said significantly it can t be denied that undeserving people have been legatees and even residuary legatees it is so with testamentary dispositions again he pursed up his lips and frowned a little do you mean to say for certain that my brother has left his land away from our family said on whom as an unhopeful woman those long words had a depressing effect a man might as well turn his land into charity land at once as leave it to some people observed his sister s question having drawn no answer what blue coat land said again oh you never can mean to say that it would be flying in the face of the almighty that s prospered him while was speaking walked away from the fireplace towards the window patrolling with his fore finger round the inside of his stock then along his whiskers and the curves of his hair he now walked to s work table opened a book which lay there and read the title aloud with pompous emphasis as if he were offering it for sale of pronounced or the maiden of the mist by the author of then turning the page he began sonorously the course of four centuries has well nigh elapsed since the series of events which are related in the following chapters took place on the continent he pronounced the last truly admirable word with the accent on the last syllable not as unaware of vulgar usage but feeling that this novel delivery enhanced the sonorous beauty which his reading had given to the whole and now the servant came in with the tray so that the moments for answering s question had gone by safely while she and watching s movements were thinking that high learning interfered sadly with serious affairs really knew nothing about old s will but he could hardly have been brought to declare any ignorance unless he had been arrested for misprision of treason i shall take a mere mouthful of ham and a glass of ale he said reassuringly as a man with public business i take a snack when i can i will back this ham he added after swallowing some morsels with alarming haste against any ham in the three kingdoms in my opinion it is better than the hams at and i think i am a tolerable judge some don t like so much sugar in their hams said but my poor brother would always have sugar
3,and liked to give others their due feeling that he could afford it he had caught the words expectant method and rang chimes on this and other learned phrases to accompany the assurance that knew a thing or two more than the rest of the doctors was far better versed in the secrets of his profession than the majority of his compeers this had happened before the affair of s illness had given to s enmity towards more definite personal ground the new comer already threatened to be a nuisance in the shape of rivalry and was certainly a nuisance in the shape of practical criticism or reflections on his hard driven elders who had had something else to do than to busy themselves with untried notions his practice had spread in one or two quarters and from the first the report of his high family had led to his being pretty generally invited so that the other medical men had to meet him at dinner in the best houses and having to meet a man whom you dislike is not observed always to end in a mutual attachment there was hardly ever so much unanimity among them as in the opinion that was an arrogant young fellow and yet ready for the sake of ultimately predominating to show a crawling subservience to that whose name was a chief flag of the anti party always defended and made a friend of him was referred to s unaccountable way of fighting on both sides here was plenty of preparation for the outburst of professional disgust at the announcement of the laws was laying down for the direction of the new hospital which were the more exasperating because there was no present possibility of interfering with his will and pleasure everybody except having refused help towards the building on the ground that they preferred giving to the old infirmary met all the expenses and had ceased to be sorry that he was purchasing the right to carry out his notions of improvement without hindrance from prejudiced coadjutors but he had had to spend large sums and the building had lingered had undertaken it had failed during its progress and before the interior fittings were begun had retired from the management of the business and when referring to the hospital he often said that however might ring if you tried him he liked good solid carpentry and masonry and had a notion both of drains and chimneys in fact the hospital had become an object of intense interest to and he would willingly have continued to spare a large yearly sum that he might rule it dictatorially without any board but he had another favorite object which also required money for its accomplishment he wished to buy some land in the neighborhood of and therefore he wished to get considerable contributions towards maintaining the hospital meanwhile he framed his plan of management the hospital was to be reserved for fever in all its forms was to be chief medical superintendent that he might have free authority to pursue all comparative investigations which his studies particularly in had shown him the importance of the other medical visitors having a consultative influence but no power to contravene s ultimate decisions and the general management was to be lodged exclusively in the hands of five directors associated with who were to have votes in the ratio of their contributions the board itself filling up any vacancy in its numbers and no mob of small contributors being admitted to a share of government there was an immediate refusal on the part of every medical man in the town to become a visitor at the fever hospital very well said to we have a capital house surgeon and dispenser a clear headed neat handed fellow we ll get from as good a country practitioner as any of them to come over twice a week and in case of any exceptional operation will come from brassing i must work the harder that s all and i have given up my post at the infirmary the plan will flourish in spite of them and then they ll be glad to come in things can t last as they are there must be all sorts of reform soon and then young fellows may be glad to come and study here was in high spirits i shall not flinch you may depend upon it said while i see you carrying out high intentions with vigor you shall have my unfailing support and i have humble confidence that the blessing which has hitherto attended my efforts against the spirit of evil in this town will not be withdrawn suitable directors to assist me i have no doubt of securing of has already given me his concurrence and a pledge to contribute yearly he has not specified the sum probably not a great one but he will be a useful member of the board a useful member was perhaps to be defined as one who would originate nothing and always vote with the medical aversion to was hardly disguised now neither nor said that he disliked s knowledge or his disposition to improve treatment what they disliked was his arrogance which nobody felt to be altogether deniable they implied that he was insolent pretentious and given to that reckless innovation for the sake of noise and show which was the essence of the charlatan the word charlatan once thrown on the air could not be let drop in those days the world was agitated about the wondrous doings of noblemen and gentlemen attesting his extraction of a fluid like mercury from the temples of a patient remarked one day smilingly to that had found a man to suit him in a charlatan in religion is sure to like other sorts of charlatans yes indeed i can imagine said keeping the number of thirty stitches carefully in her mind all the while there are so many of that sort i remember with his irons trying to make people straight when the almighty had made them crooked no no said was all right all fair and above board but there s that s the kind of fellow we call a charlatan advertising cures in ways nobody knows anything about a fellow who wants to make a noise by pretending to go deeper than other people the other day he was pretending to tap a man s brain and get quicksilver out of it good gracious what dreadful trifling with people s constitutions said after this it came to be held in various quarters that played even with respectable constitutions for his own purposes and how much more likely that in his flighty experimenting he should make sixes and sevens of hospital patients especially it was to be expected as the landlady of the had said that he would recklessly cut up their dead bodies for having attended who died apparently of a heart disease not very clearly expressed in the symptoms too daringly asked leave of her relatives to open the body and thus gave an offence quickly spreading beyond where that lady had long resided on an income such as made this association of her body with the victims of and a flagrant insult to her memory affairs were in this stage when opened the subject of the hospital to we see that he was bearing enmity and silly misconception with much spirit aware that they were partly created by his good share of success they will not drive me away he said talking confidentially in s study i have got a good opportunity here for the ends i care most about and i am pretty sure to get income enough for our wants by and by i shall go on as quietly as possible i have no seductions now away from home and work and i am more and more convinced that it will be possible to demonstrate the homogeneous origin of all the tissues and others are on the same track and i have been losing time i have no power of prophecy there said who had been puffing at his pipe thoughtfully while talked but as to the hostility in the town you ll weather it if you are prudent how am i to be prudent said i just do what comes before me to do i can t help people s ignorance and spite any more than could it isn t possible to square one s conduct to silly conclusions which nobody can foresee quite true i didn t mean that i meant only two things one is keep yourself as separable from as you can of course you can go on doing good work of your own by his help but don t get tied perhaps it seems like personal feeling in me to say so and there s a good deal of that i own but personal feeling is not always in the wrong if you boil it down to the impressions which make it simply an opinion is nothing to me said carelessly except on public grounds as to getting very closely united to him i am not fond enough of him for that but what was the other thing you meant said who was nursing his leg as comfortably as possible and feeling in no great need of advice why this take care experto crede take care not to get hampered about money matters i know by a word you let fall one day that you don t like my playing at cards so much for money you are right enough there but try and keep clear of wanting small sums that you haven t got i am perhaps talking rather superfluously but a man likes to assume superiority over himself by holding up his bad example and sermonizing on it took s hints very cordially though he would hardly have borne them from another man he could not help remembering that he had lately made some debts but these had seemed inevitable and he had no intention now to do more than keep house in a simple way the furniture for which he owed would not want renewing nor even the stock of wine for a long while many thoughts cheered him at that time and justly a man conscious of enthusiasm for worthy aims is sustained under petty hostilities by the memory of great workers who had to fight their way not without wounds and who hover in his mind as patron saints invisibly helping at home that same evening when he had been chatting with he had his long legs stretched on the sofa his head thrown back and his hands clasped behind it according to his favorite ruminating attitude while sat at the piano and played one tune after another of which her husband only knew like the emotional elephant he was that they fell in with his mood as if they had been melodious sea breezes there was something very fine in s look just then and any one might have been encouraged to bet on his achievement in his dark eyes and on his mouth and brow there was that placidity which comes from the fulness of contemplative thought the mind not searching but beholding and the glance seeming to be filled with what is behind it presently left the piano and seated herself on a chair close to the sofa and opposite her husband s face is that enough music for you my lord she said folding her hands before her and putting on a little air of meekness yes dear if you are tired said gently turning his eyes and resting them on her but not otherwise moving s presence at that moment was perhaps no more than a spoonful brought to the lake and her woman s instinct in this matter was not dull what is absorbing you she said leaning forward and bringing her face nearer to his he moved his hands and placed them gently behind her shoulders i am thinking of a great fellow who was about as old as i am three hundred years ago and had already begun a new era in anatomy i can t guess said shaking her head we used to play at guessing historical characters at s but not anatomists i ll tell you his name was and the only way he could get to know anatomy as he did was by going to snatch bodies at night from graveyards and places of execution oh said with a look of disgust on her pretty face i am very glad you are not i should have thought he might find some less horrible way than that no he couldn t said going on too earnestly to take much notice of her answer he could only get a complete skeleton by snatching the whitened bones of a criminal from the gallows and burying them and fetching them away by bits secretly in the dead of night i hope he is not one of your great heroes said half playfully half anxiously else i shall have you getting up in the night to go to s churchyard you know how angry you told me the people were about you have enemies enough already so had no wonder the medical fogies in are jealous when some of the greatest doctors living were fierce upon because they had believed in and he showed that was wrong they called him a liar and a poisonous monster but the facts of the human frame were on his side and so he got the better of them and what happened to him afterwards said with some interest oh he had a good deal of fighting to the last and they did exasperate him enough at one time to make him burn a good deal of his work then he got shipwrecked just as he was coming from to take a great chair at he died rather miserably there was a moment s pause before said do you know i often wish you had not been a medical man nay don t say that said drawing her closer to him that is like saying you wish you had married another man not at all you are clever enough for anything you might easily have been something else and your cousins at all think that you have sunk below them in your choice of a profession the cousins at may go to the devil said with scorn it was like their impudence if they said anything of the sort to you ll said i do not think it is a nice profession dear we know that she had much quiet perseverance in her opinion it is the grandest profession in the world said gravely and to say that you love me without loving the medical man in me is the same sort of thing as to say that you like eating a peach but don t like its flavor don t say that again dear it pains me very well doctor grave face said dimpling i will declare in future that i dote on skeletons and body snatchers and bits of things in phials and quarrels with everybody that end in your dying miserably no no not so bad as that said giving up remonstrance and petting her resignedly while safely married and with the hospital under his command felt himself struggling for medical reform against was becoming more and more conscious of the national struggle for another kind of reform by the time that s measure was being debated in the house of commons there was a new political animation in and a new definition of parties which might show a decided change of balance if a new election came and there were some who already predicted this event declaring that a reform bill would never be carried by the actual parliament this was what dwelt on to as a reason for congratulation that he had not yet tried his strength at the hustings things will grow and ripen as if it were a comet year said the public temper will soon get to a cometary heat now the question of reform has set in there is likely to be another election before long and by that time will have got more ideas into its head what we have to work at now is the pioneer and political meetings quite right we shall make a new thing of opinion here said only i want to keep myself independent about reform you know i don t want to go too far i want to take up s and s line you know and work at negro emancipation criminal law that kind of thing but of course i should support if you go in for the principle of reform you must be prepared to take what the situation offers said if everybody pulled for his own bit against everybody else the whole question would go to tatters yes yes i agree with you i quite take that point of view i should put it in that light i should support you know but i don t want to change the balance of the constitution and i don t think would but that is what the country wants said else there would be no meaning in political unions or any other movement that knows what it s about it wants to have a house of commons which is not weighted with nominees of the landed class but with representatives of the other interests and as to contending for a reform short of that it is like asking for a bit of an avalanche which has already begun to thunder that is fine that is the way to put it write that down now we must begin to get documents about the feeling of the country as well as the machine breaking and general distress as to documents said a two inch card will hold plenty a few rows of figures are enough to deduce misery from and a few more will show the rate at which the political determination of the people is growing good draw that out a little more at length that is an idea now write it out in the pioneer put the figures and deduce the misery you know and put the other figures and deduce and so on you have a way of putting things now when i think of i can t help wishing somebody had a pocket borough to give you you d never get elected you know and we shall always want talent in the house reform as we will we shall always want talent that avalanche and the thunder now was really a little like i want that sort of thing not ideas you know but a way of putting them pocket boroughs would be a fine thing said if they were always in the right pocket and there were always a at hand was not displeased with that complimentary comparison even from for it is a little too trying to human flesh to be conscious of expressing one s self better than others and never to have it noticed and in the general dearth of admiration for the right thing even a chance bray of applause falling exactly in time is rather fortifying felt that his literary refinements were usually beyond the limits of perception nevertheless he was beginning thoroughly to like the work of which when he began he had said to himself rather languidly why not and he studied the political situation with as ardent an interest as he had ever given to poetic metres or mediaevalism it is undeniable that but for the desire to be where was and perhaps the want of knowing what else to do would not at this time have been meditating on the needs of the english people or criticising english statesmanship he would probably have been rambling in italy sketching plans for several dramas trying prose and finding it too jejune trying verse and finding it too artificial beginning to copy bits from old pictures leaving off because they were no good and observing that after all self culture was the principal point while in politics he would have been sympathizing warmly with liberty and progress in general our sense of duty must often wait for some work which shall take the place of dilettanteism and make us feel that the quality of our action is not a matter of indifference had now accepted his bit of work though it was not that indeterminate loftiest thing which he had once dreamed of as alone worthy of continuous effort his nature warmed easily in the presence of subjects which were visibly mixed with life and action and the easily stirred rebellion in him helped the glow of public spirit in spite of and the banishment from he was rather happy getting a great deal of fresh knowledge in a vivid way and for practical purposes and making the pioneer celebrated as far as brassing never mind the smallness of the area the writing was not worse than much that reaches the four corners of the earth was occasionally irritating but s impatience was relieved by the division of his time between visits to the and retreats to his lodgings which gave variety to his life shift the pegs a little he said to himself and might be in the cabinet while i was under secretary that is the common order of things the little waves make the large ones and are of the same pattern i am better here than in the sort of life would have trained me for where the doing would be all laid down by a precedent too rigid for me to react upon i don t care for prestige or high pay as had said of him he was a sort of gypsy rather enjoying the sense of belonging to no class he had a feeling of romance in his position and a pleasant consciousness of creating a little surprise wherever he went that sort of enjoyment had been disturbed when he had felt some new distance between himself and in their accidental meeting at s and his irritation had gone out towards who had declared beforehand that would lose caste i never had any caste he would have said if that prophecy had been uttered to him and the quick blood would have come and gone like breath in his transparent skin but it is one thing to like defiance and another thing to like its consequences meanwhile the town opinion about the new editor of the pioneer was tending to confirm s view s relationship in that distinguished quarter did not like s high connections serve as an advantageous introduction if it was rumored that young was s nephew or cousin it was also rumored that would have nothing to do with him has taken him up said because that is what no man in his senses could have expected has devilish good reasons you may be sure for turning the cold shoulder on a young fellow whose bringing up he paid for just like one of those fellows who would praise a cat to sell a horse and some oddities of s more or less poetical appeared to support the editor of the trumpet in asserting that if the truth were known was not only a polish emissary but crack brained which accounted for the preternatural quickness and glibness of his speech when he got on to a platform as he did whenever he had an opportunity speaking with a facility which cast reflections on solid englishmen generally it was disgusting to to see a strip of a fellow with light curls round his head get up and speechify by the hour against institutions which had existed when he was in his cradle and in a leading article of the trumpet characterized s speech at a reform meeting as the violence of an energumen a miserable effort to shroud in the brilliancy of fireworks the daring of irresponsible statements and the poverty of a knowledge which was of the cheapest and most recent description that was a rattling article yesterday said with sarcastic intentions but what is an energumen oh a term that came up in the french revolution said this dangerous aspect of was strangely contrasted with other habits which became matter of remark he had a fondness half artistic half affectionate for little children the smaller they were on tolerably active legs and the funnier their clothing the better liked to surprise and please them we know that in rome he was given to ramble about among the poor people and the taste did not quit him in he had somehow picked up a troop of droll children little hatless boys with their galligaskins much worn and scant shirting to hang out little girls who tossed their hair out of their eyes to look at him and guardian brothers at the mature age of seven this troop he had led out on gypsy excursions to at nutting time and since the cold weather had set in he had taken them on a clear day to gather sticks for a bonfire in the hollow of a hillside where he drew out a small feast of gingerbread for them and improvised a punch and judy drama with some private home made puppets here was one oddity another was that in houses where he got friendly he was given to stretch himself at full length on the rug while he talked and was apt to be discovered in this attitude by occasional callers for whom such an irregularity was likely to confirm the notions of his dangerously mixed blood and general laxity but s articles and speeches naturally recommended him in families which the new strictness of party division had marked off on the side of reform he was invited to s but here he could not lie down on the rug and felt that his mode of talking about catholic countries as if there were any truce with antichrist illustrated the usual tendency to unsoundness in intellectual men at s however whom the irony of events had brought on the same side with in the national movement became a favorite with the ladies especially with little whom it was one of his oddities to escort when he met her in the street with her little basket giving her his arm in the eyes of the town and insisting on going with her to pay some call where she distributed her small filchings from her own share of sweet things but the house where he visited oftenest and lay most on the rug was s the two men were not at all alike but they agreed none the worse was abrupt but not irritable taking little notice of megrims in healthy people and did not usually throw away his susceptibilities on those who took no notice of them with on the other hand he pouted and was wayward nay often uncomplimentary much to her inward surprise nevertheless he was gradually becoming necessary to her entertainment by his companionship in her music his varied talk and his freedom from the grave preoccupation which with all her husband s tenderness and indulgence often made his manners unsatisfactory to her and confirmed her dislike of the medical profession inclined to be sarcastic on the superstitious faith of the people in the efficacy of the bill while nobody cared about the low state of pathology sometimes assailed with troublesome questions one evening in march in her cherry colored dress with swansdown trimming about the throat sat at the tea table lately come in tired from his outdoor work was seated sideways on an easy chair by the fire with one leg over the elbow his brow looking a little troubled as his eyes rambled over the columns of the pioneer while having noticed that he was perturbed avoided looking at him and inwardly thanked heaven that she herself had not a moody disposition was stretched on the rug contemplating the curtain pole abstractedly and humming very low the notes of when first i saw thy face while the house spaniel also stretched out with small choice of room looked from between his paws at the usurper of the rug with silent but strong objection bringing his cup of tea he threw down the paper and said to who had started up and gone to the table it s no use your puffing as a reforming landlord they only pick the more holes in his coat in the trumpet no matter those who read the pioneer don t read the trumpet said swallowing his tea and walking about do you suppose the public reads with a view to its own conversion we should have a witches brewing with a vengeance then mingle mingle mingle mingle you that mingle may and nobody would know which side he was going to take says he doesn t believe would get elected if the opportunity came the very men who profess to be for him would bring another member out of the bag at the right moment there s no harm in trying it s good to have resident members why said who was much given to use that inconvenient word in a curt tone they represent the local stupidity better said laughing and shaking his curls and they are kept on their best behavior in the neighborhood is not a bad fellow but he has done some good things on his estate that he never would have done but for this parliamentary bite he s not fitted to be a public man said with contemptuous decision he would disappoint everybody who counted on him i can see that at the hospital only there holds the reins and drives him
4,with those words uttered impetuously rose put out his hand to still with the air of a somnambulist and went away when he was gone left her chair and walked to the other end of the room leaning when she got there against a chiffonniere and looking out of the window wearily she was oppressed by ennui and by that dissatisfaction which in women s minds is continually turning into a trivial jealousy referring to no real claims springing from no deeper passion than the vague exactingness of egoism and yet capable of impelling action as well as speech there really is nothing to care for much said poor inwardly thinking of the family at who did not write to her and that perhaps when he came home would tease her about expenses she had already secretly disobeyed him by asking her father to help them and he had ended decisively by saying i am more likely to want help myself a few days afterwards it was already the end of august there was an occasion which caused some excitement in the public if it chose was to have the advantage of buying under the distinguished auspices of the furniture books and pictures which anybody might see by the handbills to be the best in every kind belonging to this was not one of the sales indicating the depression of trade on the contrary it was due to s great success in the carrying business which warranted his purchase of a mansion near already furnished in high style by an illustrious spa physician furnished indeed with such large framefuls of expensive flesh painting in the dining room that was nervous until reassured by finding the subjects to be scriptural hence the fine opportunity to purchasers which was well pointed out in the handbills of whose acquaintance with the history of art enabled him to state that the hall furniture to be sold without reserve comprised a piece of carving by a contemporary of at in those times a large sale was regarded as a kind of festival there was a table spread with the best cold eatables as at a superior funeral and facilities were offered for that generous drinking of cheerful glasses which might lead to generous and cheerful bidding for undesirable articles s sale was the more attractive in the fine weather because the house stood just at the end of the town with a garden and stables attached in that pleasant issue from called the london road which was also the road to the new hospital and to s retired residence known as the in short the auction was as good as a fair and drew all classes with leisure at command to some who risked making bids in order simply to raise prices it was almost equal to betting at the races the second day when the best furniture was to be sold everybody was there even the rector of s had looked in for a short time wishing to buy the carved table and had rubbed elbows with and there was a wreath of ladies accommodated with seats round the large table in the dining room where was mounted with desk and hammer but the rows chiefly of masculine faces behind were often varied by incomings and outgoings both from the door and the large bow window opening on to the lawn everybody that day did not include whose health could not well endure crowds and draughts but had particularly wished to have a certain picture a supper at emmaus attributed in the catalogue to and at the last moment before the day of the sale had called at the office of the pioneer of which he was now one of the proprietors to beg of as a great favor that he would obligingly use his remarkable knowledge of pictures on behalf of and judge of the value of this particular painting if added the scrupulously polite banker attendance at the sale would not interfere with the arrangements for your departure which i know is imminent this proviso might have sounded rather satirically in s ear if he had been in a mood to care about such satire it referred to an understanding entered into many weeks before with the proprietors of the paper that he should be at liberty any day he pleased to hand over the management to the subeditor whom he had been training since he wished finally to quit but indefinite visions of ambition are weak against the ease of doing what is habitual or beguilingly agreeable and we all know the difficulty of carrying out a resolve when we secretly long that it may turn out to be unnecessary in such states of mind the most incredulous person has a private leaning towards miracle impossible to conceive how our wish could be fulfilled still very wonderful things have happened did not confess this weakness to himself but he lingered what was the use of going to london at that time of the year the rugby men who would remember him were not there and so far as political writing was concerned he would rather for a few weeks go on with the pioneer at the present moment however when was speaking to him he had both a strengthened resolve to go and an equally strong resolve not to go till he had once more seen hence he replied that he had reasons for deferring his departure a little and would be happy to go to the sale was in a defiant mood his consciousness being deeply stung with the thought that the people who looked at him probably knew a fact tantamount to an accusation against him as a fellow with low designs which were to be frustrated by a disposal of property like most people who assert their freedom with regard to conventional distinction he was prepared to be sudden and quick at quarrel with any one who might hint that he had personal reasons for that assertion that there was anything in his blood his bearing or his character to which he gave the mask of an opinion when he was under an irritating impression of this kind he would go about for days with a defiant look the color changing in his transparent skin as if he were on the qui vive watching for something which he had to dart upon this expression was peculiarly noticeable in him at the sale and those who had only seen him in his moods of gentle oddity or of bright enjoyment would have been struck with a contrast he was not sorry to have this occasion for appearing in public before the tribes of and the rest who looked down on him as an adventurer and were in a state of brutal ignorance about who sneered at his polish blood and were themselves of a breed very much in need of crossing he stood in a conspicuous place not far from the auctioneer with a fore finger in each side pocket and his head thrown backward not caring to speak to anybody though he had been cordially welcomed as a connoiss ure by who was enjoying the utmost activity of his great faculties and surely among all men whose vocation requires them to exhibit their powers of speech the happiest is a prosperous provincial auctioneer keenly alive to his own jokes and sensible of his encyclopedic knowledge some saturnine sour blooded persons might object to be constantly insisting on the merits of all articles from boot jacks to but had a kindly liquid in his veins he was an admirer by nature and would have liked to have the universe under his hammer feeling that it would go at a higher figure for his recommendation meanwhile s drawing room furniture was enough for him when had come in a second fender said to have been forgotten in its right place suddenly claimed the auctioneer s enthusiasm which he distributed on the equitable principle of praising those things most which were most in need of praise the fender was of polished steel with much lancet shaped open work and a sharp edge now ladies said he i shall appeal to you here is a fender which at any other sale would hardly be offered with out reserve being as i may say for quality of steel and quaintness of design a kind of thing here dropped his voice and became slightly nasal trimming his outlines with his left finger that might not fall in with ordinary tastes allow me to tell you that by and by this style of workmanship will be the only one in vogue half a crown you said thank you going at half a crown this characteristic fender and i have particular information that the antique style is very much sought after in high quarters three shillings three and sixpence hold it well up look ladies at the chastity of the design i have no doubt myself that it was turned out in the last century four shillings four shillings it s not a thing i would put in my drawing room said audibly for the warning of the rash husband i wonder at every blessed child s head that fell against it would be cut in two the edge is like a knife quite true rejoined quickly and most uncommonly useful to have a fender at hand that will cut if you have a leather shoe tie or a bit of string that wants cutting and no knife at hand many a man has been left hanging because there was no knife to cut him down gentlemen here s a fender that if you had the misfortune to hang yourselves would cut you down in no time with astonishing celerity four and sixpence five five and sixpence an appropriate thing for a spare bedroom where there was a four poster and a guest a little out of his mind six shillings thank you going at six shillings going gone the auctioneer s glance which had been searching round him with a preternatural susceptibility to all signs of bidding here dropped on the paper before him and his voice too dropped into a tone of indifferent despatch as he said be handy it was worth six shillings to have a fender you could always tell that joke on said laughing low and apologetically to his next neighbor he was a diffident though distinguished nurseryman and feared that the audience might regard his bid as a foolish one meanwhile had brought a trayful of small articles now ladies said taking up one of the articles this tray contains a very recherchy lot a collection of trifles for the drawing room table and trifles make the sum of human things nothing more important than trifles yes yes by and by but pass the tray round these bijoux must be examined ladies this i have in my hand is an ingenious contrivance a sort of practical rebus i may call it here you see it looks like an elegant heart shaped box portable for the pocket there again it becomes like a splendid double flower an ornament for the table and now allowed the flower to fall alarmingly into strings of heart shaped leaves a book of riddles no less than five hundred printed in a beautiful red gentlemen if i had less of a conscience i should not wish you to bid high for this lot i have a longing for it myself what can promote innocent mirth and i may say virtue more than a good riddle it hinders profane language and attaches a man to the society of refined females this ingenious article itself without the elegant domino box card basket c ought alone to give a high price to the lot carried in the pocket it might make an individual welcome in any society four shillings sir four shillings for this remarkable collection of riddles with the et caeteras here is a sample how must you spell honey to make it catch lady birds answer money you hear lady birds honey money this is an amusement to sharpen the intellect it has a sting it has what we call satire and wit without indecency four and sixpence five shillings the bidding ran on with warming rivalry was a bidder and this was too exasperating couldn t afford it and only wanted to hinder every other man from making a figure the current carried even with it but this committal of himself to an opinion fell from him with so little sacrifice of his neutral expression that the bid might not have been detected as his but for the friendly oaths of who wanted to know what would do with blasted stuff only fit for haberdashers given over to that state of perdition which the horse dealer so cordially recognized in the majority of earthly existences the lot was finally knocked down at a guinea to a young slender of the neighborhood who was reckless with his pocket money and felt his want of memory for riddles come this is too bad you ve been putting some old maid s rubbish into the sale murmured getting close to the auctioneer i want to see how the prints go and i must be off soon immediately it was only an act of benevolence which your noble heart would approve quick with the prints lot now gentlemen you who are connoiss ures you are going to have a treat here is an engraving of the duke of wellington surrounded by his staff on the field of waterloo and notwithstanding recent events which have as it were enveloped our great hero in a cloud i will be bold to say for a man in my line must not be blown about by political winds that a finer subject of the modern order belonging to our own time and epoch the understanding of man could hardly conceive angels might perhaps but not men sirs not men who painted it said much impressed it is a proof before the letter the painter is not known answered with a certain gaspingness in his last words after which he pursed up his lips and stared round him i ll bid a pound said in a tone of resolved emotion as of a man ready to put himself in the breach whether from awe or pity nobody raised the price on him next came two dutch prints which had been eager for and after he had secured them he went away other prints and afterwards some paintings were sold to leading ers who had come with a special desire for them and there was a more active movement of the audience in and out some who had bought what they wanted going away others coming in either quite newly or from a temporary visit to the refreshments which were spread under the marquee on the lawn it was this marquee that was bent on buying and he appeared to like looking inside it frequently as a foretaste of its possession on the last occasion of his return from it he was observed to bring with him a new companion a stranger to and every one else whose appearance however led to the supposition that he might be a relative of the horse dealer s also given to indulgence his large whiskers imposing swagger and swing of the leg made him a striking figure but his suit of black rather shabby at the edges caused the prejudicial inference that he was not able to afford himself as much indulgence as he liked who is it you ve picked up said aside ask him yourself returned he said he d just turned in from the road eyed the stranger who was leaning back against his stick with one hand using his toothpick with the other and looking about him with a certain restlessness apparently under the silence imposed on him by circumstances at length the supper at emmaus was brought forward to s immense relief for he was getting so tired of the proceedings that he had drawn back a little and leaned his shoulder against the wall just behind the auctioneer he now came forward again and his eye caught the conspicuous stranger who rather to his surprise was staring at him markedly but was immediately appealed to by yes yes this interests you as a connoiss ure i think it is some pleasure the auctioneer went on with a rising fervor to have a picture like this to show to a company of ladies and gentlemen a picture worth any sum to an individual whose means were on a level with his judgment it is a painting of the italian school by the celebrated the greatest painter in the world the chief of the old masters as they are called i take it because they were up to a thing or two beyond most of us in possession of secrets now lost to the bulk of mankind let me tell you gentlemen i have seen a great many pictures by the old masters and they are not all up to this mark some of them are darker than you might like and not family subjects but here is a the frame alone is worth pounds which any lady might be proud to hang up a suitable thing for what we call a refectory in a charitable institution if any gentleman of the corporation wished to show his munifi cence turn it a little sir yes turn it a little towards having been abroad understands the merit of these things you observe all eyes were for a moment turned towards who said coolly five pounds the auctioneer burst out in deep remonstrance ah the frame alone is worth that ladies and gentlemen for the credit of the town suppose it should be discovered hereafter that a gem of art has been amongst us in this town and nobody in awake to it five guineas five seven six five ten ll ladies still it is a gem and full many a gem as the poet says has been allowed to go at a nominal price because the public knew no better because it was offered in circles where there was i was going to say a low feeling but no six pounds six guineas a of the first order going at six guineas it is an insult to religion ladies it touches us all as christians gentlemen that a subject like this should go at such a low figure six pounds ten seven the bidding was brisk and continued to share in it remembering that had a strong wish for the picture and thinking that he might stretch the price to twelve pounds but it was knocked down to him at ten guineas whereupon he pushed his way towards the bow window and went out he chose to go under the marquee to get a glass of water being hot and thirsty it was empty of other visitors and he asked the woman in attendance to fetch him some fresh water but before she was well gone he was annoyed to see entering the florid stranger who had stared at him it struck at this moment that the man might be one of those political parasitic insects of the bloated kind who had once or twice claimed acquaintance with him as having heard him speak on the reform question and who might think of getting a shilling by news in this light his person already rather heating to behold on a summer s day appeared the more disagreeable and half seated on the elbow of a garden chair turned his eyes carefully away from the comer but this signified little to our acquaintance who never hesitated to thrust himself on unwilling observation if it suited his purpose to do so he moved a step or two till he was in front of and said with full mouthed haste excuse me was your mother s name starting to his feet moved backward a step frowning and saying with some fierceness yes sir it was and what is that to you it was in s nature that the first spark it threw out was a direct answer of the question and a challenge of the consequences to have said what is that to you in the first instance would have seemed like shuffling as if he minded who knew anything about his origin on his side had not the same eagerness for a collision which was implied in s threatening air the slim young fellow with his girl s complexion looked like a tiger cat ready to spring on him under such circumstances s pleasure in annoying his company was kept in abeyance no offence my good sir no offence i only remember your mother knew her when she was a girl but it is your father that you feature sir i had the pleasure of seeing your father too parents alive no thundered in the same attitude as before should be glad to do you a service by i should hope to meet again hereupon who had lifted his hat with the last words turned himself round with a swing of his leg and walked away looked after him a moment and could see that he did not re enter the auction room but appeared to be walking towards the road for an instant he thought that he had been foolish not to let the man go on talking but no on the whole he preferred doing without knowledge from that source later in the evening however overtook him in the street and appearing either to have forgotten the roughness of his former reception or to intend avenging it by a forgiving familiarity greeted him jovially and walked by his side remarking at first on the pleasantness of the town and neighborhood suspected that the man had been drinking and was considering how to shake him off when said i ve been abroad myself i ve seen the world used to parley vous a little it was at i saw your father a most uncommon likeness you are of him by mouth nose eyes hair turned off your brow just like his a little in the foreign style doesn t do much of that but your father was very ill when i saw him lord lord hands you might see through you were a small youngster then did he get well no said curtly ah well i ve often wondered what became of your mother she ran away from her friends when she was a young lass a proud spirited lass and pretty by i knew the reason why she ran away said winking slowly as he looked sideways at you know nothing dishonorable of her sir said turning on him rather savagely but just now was not sensitive to shades of manner not a bit said he tossing his head decisively she was a little too honorable to like her friends that was it here again winked slowly lord bless you i knew all about em a little in what you may call the respectable thieving line the high style of receiving house none of your holes and corners first rate slap up shop high profits and no mistake but lord would have known nothing about it a dashing young lady she was fine boarding school fit for a lord s wife only threw it at her out of spite because she would have nothing to do with him and so she ran away from the whole concern i travelled for em sir in a gentlemanly way at a high salary they didn t mind her running away at first godly folks sir very godly and she was for the stage the son was alive then and the daughter was at a discount hallo here we are at the blue what do you say shall we turn in and have a glass no i must say good evening said dashing up a passage which led into and almost running to get out of s reach he walked a long while on the road away from the town glad of the starlit darkness when it came he felt as if he had had dirt cast on him amidst shouts of scorn there was this to confirm the fellow s statement that his mother never would tell him the reason why she had run away from her family well what was he the worse supposing the truth about that family to be the ugliest his mother had braved hardship in order to separate herself from it but if s friends had known this story if the had known it they would have had a fine color to give their suspicions a welcome ground for thinking him unfit to come near her however let them suspect what they pleased they would find themselves in the wrong they would find out that the blood in his veins was as free from the taint of meanness as theirs the same night when returned from a journey to brassing on business his good wife met him in the entrance hall and drew him into his private sitting room she said fixing her honest eyes upon him anxiously there has been such a disagreeable man here asking for you it has made me quite uncomfortable what kind of man my dear said dreadfully certain of the answer a red faced man with large whiskers and most impudent in his manner he declared he was an old friend of yours and said you would be sorry not to see him he wanted to wait for you here but i told him he could see you at the bank to morrow morning most impudent he was stared at me and said his friend had luck in wives i don t believe he would have gone away if had not happened to break his chain and come running round on the gravel for i was in the garden so i said you d better go away the dog is very fierce and i can t hold him do you really know anything of such a man i believe i know who he is my dear said in his usual subdued voice an unfortunate dissolute wretch whom i helped too much in days gone by however i presume you will not be troubled by him again he will probably come to the bank to beg doubtless no more was said on the subject until the next day when had returned from the town and was dressing for dinner his wife not sure that he was come home looked into his dressing room and saw him with his coat and cravat off leaning one arm on a chest of drawers and staring absently at the ground he started nervously and looked up as she entered you look very ill is there anything the matter i have a good deal of pain in my head said who was so frequently ailing that his wife was always ready to believe in this cause of depression sit down and let me sponge it with vinegar physically did not want the vinegar but morally the affectionate attention soothed him though always polite it was his habit to receive such services with marital coolness as his wife s duty but to day while she was bending over him he said you are very good in a tone which had something new in it to her ear she did not know exactly what the novelty was but her woman s solicitude shaped itself into a darting thought that he might be going to have an illness has anything worried you she said did that man come to you at the bank yes it was as i had supposed he is a man who at one time might have done better but he has sunk into a drunken debauched creature is he quite gone away said anxiously but for certain reasons she refrained from adding it was very disagreeable to hear him calling himself a friend of yours at that moment she would not have liked to say anything which implied her habitual consciousness that her husband s earlier connections were not quite on a level with her own not that she knew much about them that her husband had at first been employed in a bank that he had afterwards entered into what he called city business and gained a fortune before he was three and thirty that he had married a widow who was much older than himself a dissenter and in other ways probably of that disadvantageous quality usually perceptible in a first wife if inquired into with the dispassionate judgment of a second was almost as much as she had cared to learn beyond the glimpses which s narrative occasionally gave of his early bent towards religion his inclination to be a preacher and his association with missionary and philanthropic efforts she believed in him as an excellent man whose piety carried a peculiar eminence in belonging to a layman whose influence had turned her own mind toward seriousness and whose share of perishable good had been the means of raising her own position but she also liked to think that it was well in every sense for to have won the hand of whose family was undeniable in a light a better light surely than any thrown in london thoroughfares or dissenting chapel yards the unreformed provincial mind distrusted london and while true religion was everywhere saving honest was convinced that to be saved in the church was more respectable she so much wished to ignore towards others that her husband had ever been a london dissenter that she liked to keep it out of sight even in talking to him he was quite aware of this indeed in some respects he was rather afraid of this ingenuous wife whose imitative piety and native worldliness were equally sincere who had nothing to be ashamed of and whom he had married out of a thorough inclination still subsisting but his fears were such as belong to a man who cares to maintain his recognized supremacy the loss of high consideration from his wife as from every one else who did not clearly hate him out of enmity to the truth would be as the beginning of death to him when she said is he quite gone away oh i trust so he answered with an effort to throw as much sober unconcern into his tone as possible but in truth was very far from a state of quiet trust in the interview at the bank had made it evident that his eagerness to torment was almost as strong in him as any other greed he had frankly said that he had turned out of the way to come to just to look about him and see whether the neighborhood would suit him to live in he had certainly had a few debts to pay more than he expected but the two hundred pounds were not gone yet a cool five and twenty would suffice him to go away with for the present what he had wanted chiefly was to see his friend and family and know all about the prosperity of a man to whom he was so much attached by and by he might come back for a longer stay this time declined to be seen off the premises as he expressed it declined to quit under s eyes he meant to go by coach the next day if he chose felt himself helpless neither threats nor coaxing could avail he could not count on any persistent fear nor on any promise on the contrary he felt a cold certainty at his heart that unless
5,it came shortly before the memorable meeting at the town hall and was nothing less than a letter from to which turned indeed chiefly on his new interest in plans of colonization but mentioned incidentally that he might find it necessary to pay a visit to within the next few weeks a very pleasant necessity he said almost as good as holidays to a schoolboy he hoped there was his old place on the rug and a great deal of music in store for him but he was quite uncertain as to the time while was reading the letter to her face looked like a reviving flower it grew prettier and more blooming there was nothing unendurable now the debts were paid was coming and would be persuaded to leave and settle in london which was so different from a provincial town that was a bright bit of morning but soon the sky became black over poor the presence of a new gloom in her husband about which he was entirely reserved towards her for he dreaded to expose his lacerated feeling to her neutrality and misconception soon received a painfully strange explanation alien to all her previous notions of what could affect her happiness in the new gayety of her spirits thinking that had merely a worse fit of moodiness than usual causing him to leave her remarks unanswered and evidently to keep out of her way as much as possible she chose a few days after the meeting and without speaking to him on the subject to send out notes of invitation for a small evening party feeling convinced that this was a judicious step since people seemed to have been keeping aloof from them and wanted restoring to the old habit of intercourse when the invitations had been accepted she would tell and give him a wise admonition as to how a medical man should behave to his neighbors for had the gravest little airs possible about other people s duties but all the invitations were declined and the last answer came into s hands this is s scratch what is he writing to you about said wonderingly as he handed the note to her she was obliged to let him see it and looking at her severely he said why on earth have you been sending out invitations without telling me i beg i insist that you will not invite any one to this house i suppose you have been inviting others and they have refused too she said nothing do you hear me thundered yes certainly i hear you said turning her head aside with the movement of a graceful long necked bird tossed his head without any grace and walked out of the room feeling himself dangerous s thought was that he was getting more and more unbearable not that there was any new special reason for this peremptoriness his indisposition to tell her anything in which he was sure beforehand that she would not be interested was growing into an unreflecting habit and she was in ignorance of everything connected with the thousand pounds except that the loan had come from her uncle s odious humors and their neighbors apparent avoidance of them had an unaccountable date for her in their relief from money difficulties if the invitations had been accepted she would have gone to invite her mamma and the rest whom she had seen nothing of for several days and she now put on her bonnet to go and inquire what had become of them all suddenly feeling as if there were a conspiracy to leave her in isolation with a husband disposed to offend everybody it was after the dinner hour and she found her father and mother seated together alone in the drawing room they greeted her with sad looks saying well my dear and no more she had never seen her father look so downcast and seating herself near him she said is there anything the matter papa he did not answer but said oh my dear have you heard nothing it won t be long before it reaches you is it anything about said turning pale the idea of trouble immediately connected itself with what had been unaccountable to her in him oh my dear yes to think of your marrying into this trouble debt was bad enough but this will be worse stay stay said have you heard nothing about your uncle no papa said the poor thing feeling as if trouble were not anything she had before experienced but some invisible power with an iron grasp that made her soul faint within her her father told her everything saying at the end it s better for you to know my dear i think must leave the town things have gone against him i dare say he couldn t help it i don t accuse him of any harm said he had always before been disposed to find the utmost fault with the shock to was terrible it seemed to her that no lot could be so cruelly hard as hers to have married a man who had become the centre of infamous suspicions in many cases it is inevitable that the shame is felt to be the worst part of crime and it would have required a great deal of disentangling reflection such as had never entered into s life for her in these moments to feel that her trouble was less than if her husband had been certainly known to have done something criminal all the shame seemed to be there and she had innocently married this man with the belief that he and his family were a glory to her she showed her usual reticence to her parents and only said that if had done as she wished he would have left long ago she bears it beyond anything said her mother when she was gone ah thank god said who was much broken down but went home with a sense of justified repugnance towards her husband what had he really done how had he really acted she did not know why had he not told her everything he did not speak to her on the subject and of course she could not speak to him it came into her mind once that she would ask her father to let her go home again but dwelling on that prospect made it seem utter dreariness to her a married woman gone back to live with her parents life seemed to have no meaning for her in such a position she could not contemplate herself in it the next two days observed a change in her and believed that she had heard the bad news would she speak to him about it or would she go on forever in the silence which seemed to imply that she believed him guilty we must remember that he was in a morbid state of mind in which almost all contact was pain certainly in this case had equal reason to complain of reserve and want of confidence on his part but in the bitterness of his soul he excused himself was he not justified in shrinking from the task of telling her since now she knew the truth she had no impulse to speak to him but a deeper lying consciousness that he was in fault made him restless and the silence between them became intolerable to him it was as if they were both adrift on one piece of wreck and looked away from each other he thought i am a fool haven t i given up expecting anything i have married care not help and that evening he said have you heard anything that distresses you yes she answered laying down her work which she had been carrying on with a languid semi consciousness most unlike her usual self what have you heard everything i suppose papa told me that people think me disgraced yes said faintly beginning to sew again automatically there was silence thought if she has any trust in me any notion of what i am she ought to speak now and say that she does not believe i have deserved disgrace but on her side went on moving her fingers languidly whatever was to be said on the subject she expected to come from what did she know and if he were innocent of any wrong why did he not do something to clear himself this silence of hers brought a new rush of gall to that bitter mood in which had been saying to himself that nobody believed in him even had not come forward he had begun to question her with the intent that their conversation should disperse the chill fog which had gathered between them but he felt his resolution checked by despairing resentment even this trouble like the rest she seemed to regard as if it were hers alone he was always to her a being apart doing what she objected to he started from his chair with an angry impulse and thrusting his hands in his pockets walked up and down the room there was an underlying consciousness all the while that he should have to master this anger and tell her everything and convince her of the facts for he had almost learned the lesson that he must bend himself to her nature and that because she came short in her sympathy he must give the more soon he recurred to his intention of opening himself the occasion must not be lost if he could bring her to feel with some solemnity that here was a slander which must be met and not run away from and that the whole trouble had come out of his desperate want of money it would be a moment for urging powerfully on her that they should be one in the resolve to do with as little money as possible so that they might weather the bad time and keep themselves independent he would mention the definite measures which he desired to take and win her to a willing spirit he was bound to try this and what else was there for him to do he did not know how long he had been walking uneasily backwards and forwards but felt that it was long and wished that he would sit down she too had begun to think this an opportunity for urging on what he ought to do whatever might be the truth about all this misery there was one dread which asserted itself at last seated himself not in his usual chair but in one nearer to leaning aside in it towards her and looking at her gravely before he reopened the sad subject he had conquered himself so far and was about to speak with a sense of solemnity as on an occasion which was not to be repeated he had even opened his lips when letting her hands fall looked at him and said surely well surely now at last you have given up the idea of staying in i cannot go on living here let us go to london papa and every one else says you had better go whatever misery i have to put up with it will be easier away from here felt miserably jarred instead of that critical outpouring for which he had prepared himself with effort here was the old round to be gone through again he could not bear it with a quick change of countenance he rose and went out of the room perhaps if he had been strong enough to persist in his determination to be the more because she was less that evening might have had a better issue if his energy could have borne down that check he might still have wrought on s vision and will we cannot be sure that any natures however inflexible or peculiar will resist this effect from a more massive being than their own they may be taken by storm and for the moment converted becoming part of the soul which enwraps them in the ardor of its movement but poor had a throbbing pain within him and his energy had fallen short of its task the beginning of mutual understanding and resolve seemed as far off as ever nay it seemed blocked out by the sense of unsuccessful effort they lived on from day to day with their thoughts still apart going about what work he had in a mood of despair and feeling with some justification that he was behaving cruelly it was of no use to say anything to but when came she was determined to tell him everything in spite of her general reticence she needed some one who would recognize her wrongs some days later was riding to in consequence of a summons from the summons had not been unexpected since it had followed a letter from in which he stated that he had resumed his arrangements for quitting and must remind of his previous communications about the hospital to the purport of which he still adhered it had been his duty before taking further steps to reopen the subject with who now wished as before to discuss the question with your views may possibly have undergone some change wrote but in that case also it is desirable that you should lay them before her awaited his arrival with eager interest though in deference to her masculine advisers she had refrained from what had called interfering in this business the hardship of s position was continually in her mind and when applied to her again about the hospital she felt that the opportunity was come to her which she had been hindered from hastening in her luxurious home wandering under the boughs of her own great trees her thought was going out over the lot of others and her emotions were imprisoned the idea of some active good within her reach haunted her like a passion and another s need having once come to her as a distinct image preoccupied her desire with the yearning to give relief and made her own ease tasteless she was full of confident hope about this interview with never heeding what was said of his personal reserve never heeding that she was a very young woman nothing could have seemed more irrelevant to than insistence on her youth and sex when she was moved to show her human fellowship as she sat waiting in the library she could do nothing but live through again all the past scenes which had brought into her memories they all owed their significance to her marriage and its troubles but no there were two occasions in which the image of had come painfully in connection with his wife and some one else the pain had been allayed for but it had left in her an awakened conjecture as to what s marriage might be to him a susceptibility to the slightest hint about these thoughts were like a drama to her and made her eyes bright and gave an attitude of suspense to her whole frame though she was only looking out from the brown library on to the turf and the bright green buds which stood in relief against the dark evergreens when came in she was almost shocked at the change in his face which was strikingly perceptible to her who had not seen him for two months it was not the change of emaciation but that effect which even young faces will very soon show from the persistent presence of resentment and despondency her cordial look when she put out her hand to him softened his expression but only with melancholy i have wished very much to see you for a long while said when they were seated opposite each other but i put off asking you to come until applied to me again about the hospital i know that the advantage of keeping the management of it separate from that of the infirmary depends on you or at least on the good which you are encouraged to hope for from having it under your control and i am sure you will not refuse to tell me exactly what you think you want to decide whether you should give a generous support to the hospital said i cannot conscientiously advise you to do it in dependence on any activity of mine i may be obliged to leave the town he spoke curtly feeling the ache of despair as to his being able to carry out any purpose that had set her mind against not because there is no one to believe in you said pouring out her words in clearness from a full heart i know the unhappy mistakes about you i knew them from the first moment to be mistakes you have never done anything vile you would not do anything dishonorable it was the first assurance of belief in him that had fallen on s ears he drew a deep breath and said thank you he could say no more it was something very new and strange in his life that these few words of trust from a woman should be so much to him i beseech you to tell me how everything was said fearlessly i am sure that the truth would clear you started up from his chair and went towards the window forgetting where he was he had so often gone over in his mind the possibility of explaining everything without aggravating appearances that would tell perhaps unfairly against and had so often decided against it he had so often said to himself that his assertions would not change people s impressions that s words sounded like a temptation to do something which in his soberness he had pronounced to be unreasonable tell me pray said with simple earnestness then we can consult together it is wicked to let people think evil of any one falsely when it can be hindered turned remembering where he was and saw s face looking up at him with a sweet trustful gravity the presence of a noble nature generous in its wishes ardent in its charity changes the lights for us we begin to see things again in their larger quieter masses and to believe that we too can be seen and judged in the wholeness of our character that influence was beginning to act on who had for many days been seeing all life as one who is dragged and struggling amid the throng he sat down again and felt that he was recovering his old self in the consciousness that he was with one who believed in it i don t want he said to bear hard on who has lent me money of which i was in need though i would rather have gone without it now he is hunted down and miserable and has only a poor thread of life in him but i should like to tell you everything it will be a comfort to me to speak where belief has gone beforehand and where i shall not seem to be offering assertions of my own honesty you will feel what is fair to another as you feel what is fair to me do trust me said i will not repeat anything without your leave but at the very least i could say that you have made all the circumstances clear to me and that i know you are not in any way guilty would believe me and my uncle and nay there are persons in to whom i could go although they don t know much of me they would believe me they would know that i could have no other motive than truth and justice i would take any pains to clear you i have very little to do there is nothing better that i can do in the world s voice as she made this childlike picture of what she would do might have been almost taken as a proof that she could do it effectively the searching tenderness of her woman s tones seemed made for a defence against ready accusers did not stay to think that she was quixotic he gave himself up for the first time in his life to the exquisite sense of leaning entirely on a generous sympathy without any check of proud reserve and he told her everything from the time when under the pressure of his difficulties he unwillingly made his first application to gradually in the relief of speaking getting into a more thorough utterance of what had gone on in his mind entering fully into the fact that his treatment of the patient was opposed to the dominant practice into his doubts at the last his ideal of medical duty and his uneasy consciousness that the acceptance of the money had made some difference in his private inclination and professional behavior though not in his fulfilment of any publicly recognized obligation it has come to my knowledge since he added that sent some one to examine the housekeeper at stone court and she said that she gave the patient all the opium in the phial i left as well as a good deal of brandy but that would not have been opposed to ordinary prescriptions even of first rate men the suspicions against me had no hold there they are grounded on the knowledge that i took money that had strong motives for wishing the man to die and that he gave me the money as a bribe to concur in some malpractices or other against the patient that in any case i accepted a bribe to hold my tongue they are just the suspicions that cling the most obstinately because they lie in people s inclination and can never be disproved how my orders came to be disobeyed is a question to which i don t know the answer it is still possible that was innocent of any criminal intention even possible that he had nothing to do with the disobedience and merely abstained from mentioning it but all that has nothing to do with the public belief it is one of those cases on which a man is condemned on the ground of his character it is believed that he has committed a crime in some undefined way because he had the motive for doing it and s character has enveloped me because i took his money i am simply blighted like a damaged ear of corn the business is done and can t be undone oh it is hard said i understand the difficulty there is in your vindicating yourself and that all this should have come to you who had meant to lead a higher life than the common and to find out better ways i cannot bear to rest in this as unchangeable i know you meant that i remember what you said to me when you first spoke to me about the hospital there is no sorrow i have thought more about than that to love what is great and try to reach it and yet to fail yes said feeling that here he had found room for the full meaning of his grief i had some ambition i meant everything to be different with me i thought i had more strength and mastery but the most terrible obstacles are such as nobody can see except oneself suppose said meditatively suppose we kept on the hospital according to the present plan and you stayed here though only with the friendship and support of a few the evil feeling towards you would gradually die out there would come opportunities in which people would be forced to acknowledge that they had been unjust to you because they would see that your purposes were pure you may still win a great fame like the and i have heard you speak of and we shall all be proud of you she ended with a smile that might do if i had my old trust in myself said mournfully nothing galls me more than the notion of turning round and running away before this slander leaving it unchecked behind me still i can t ask any one to put a great deal of money into a plan which depends on me it would be quite worth my while said simply only think i am very uncomfortable with my money because they tell me i have too little for any great scheme of the sort i like best and yet i have too much i don t know what to do i have seven hundred a year of my own fortune and nineteen hundred a year that left me and between three and four thousand of ready money in the bank i wished to raise money and pay it off gradually out of my income which i don t want to buy land with and found a village which should be a school of industry but and my uncle have convinced me that the risk would be too great so you see that what i should most rejoice at would be to have something good to do with my money i should like it to make other people s lives better to them it makes me very uneasy coming all to me who don t want it a smile broke through the gloom of s face the childlike grave eyed earnestness with which said all this was irresistible blent into an adorable whole with her ready understanding of high experience of lower experience such as plays a great part in the world poor had a very blurred shortsighted knowledge little helped by her imagination but she took the smile as encouragement of her plan i think you see now that you spoke too scrupulously she said in a tone of persuasion the hospital would be one good and making your life quite whole and well again would be another s smile had died away you have the goodness as well as the money to do all that if it could be done he said but he hesitated a little while looking vaguely towards the window and she sat in silent expectation at last he turned towards her and said impetuously why should i not tell you you know what sort of bond marriage is you will understand everything felt her heart beginning to beat faster had he that sorrow too but she feared to say any word and he went on immediately it is impossible for me now to do anything to take any step without considering my wife s happiness the thing that i might like to do if i were alone is become impossible to me i can t see her miserable she married me without knowing what she was going into and it might have been better for her if she had not married me i know i know you could not give her pain if you were not obliged to do it said with keen memory of her own life and she has set her mind against staying she wishes to go the troubles she has had here have wearied her said breaking off again lest he should say too much but when she saw the good that might come of staying said remonstrantly looking at as if he had forgotten the reasons which had just been considered he did not speak immediately she would not see it he said at last curtly feeling at first that this statement must do without explanation and indeed i have lost all spirit about carrying on my life here he paused a moment and then following the impulse to let see deeper into the difficulty of his life he said the fact is this trouble has come upon her confusedly we have not been able to speak to each other about it i am not sure what is in her mind about it she may fear that i have really done something base it is my fault i ought to be more open but i have been suffering cruelly may i go and see her said eagerly would she accept my sympathy i would tell her that you have not been blamable before any one s judgment but your own i would tell her that you shall be cleared in every fair mind i would cheer her heart you ask her if i may go to see her i did see her once i am sure you may said seizing the proposition with some hope she would feel honored cheered i think by the proof that you at least have some respect for me i will not speak to her about your coming that she may not connect it with my wishes at all i know very well that i ought not to have left anything to be told her by others but he broke off and there was a moment s silence refrained from saying what was in her mind how well she knew that there might be invisible barriers to speech between husband and wife this was a point on which even sympathy might make a wound she returned to the more outward aspect of s position saying cheerfully and if knew that there were friends who would believe in you and support you she might then be glad that you should stay in your place and recover your hopes and do what you meant to do perhaps then you would see that it was right to agree with what i proposed about your continuing at the hospital surely you would if you still have faith in it as a means of making your knowledge useful did not answer and she saw that he was debating with himself you need not decide immediately she said gently a few days hence it will be early enough for me to send my answer to still waited but at last turned to speak in his most decisive tones no i prefer that there should be no interval left for wavering i am no longer sure enough of myself i mean of what it would be possible for me to do under the changed circumstances of my life it would be dishonorable to let others engage themselves to anything serious in dependence on me i might be obliged to go away after all i see little chance of anything else the whole thing is too problematic i cannot consent to be the cause of your goodness being wasted no let the new hospital be joined with the old infirmary and everything go on as it might have done if i had never come i have kept a valuable register since i have been there i shall send it to a man who will make use of it he ended bitterly i can think of nothing for a long while but getting an income it hurts me very much to hear you speak so hopelessly said it would be a happiness to your friends who believe in your future in your power to do great things if you would let them save you from that think how much money i have it would be like taking a burthen from me if you took some of it every year till you got free from this fettering want of income why should not people do these things it is
