CD(...2Cities),peculiar ear of a place that as mr lorry stood at the open window looking for the father and daughter whose steps he heard he fancied they would never approach not only would the echoes die away as though the steps had gone but echoes of other steps that never came would be heard in their stead and would die away for good when they seemed close at hand however father and daughter did at last appear and miss pross was ready at the street door to receive them miss pross was a pleasant sight albeit wild and red and grim taking off her darling s bonnet when she came up stairs and touching it up with the ends of her handkerchief and blowing the dust off it and folding her mantle ready for laying by and smoothing her rich hair with as much pride as she could possibly have taken in her own hair if she had been the vainest and handsomest of women her darling was a pleasant sight too embracing her and thanking her and protesting against her taking so much trouble for her which last she only dared to do playfully or miss pross sorely hurt would have retired to her own chamber and cried the doctor was a pleasant sight too looking on at them and telling miss pross how she spoilt lucie in accents and with eyes that had as much spoiling in them as miss pross had and would have had more if it were possible mr lorry was a pleasant sight too beaming at all this in his little wig and thanking his bachelor stars for having lighted him in his declining years to a home but no hundreds of people came to see the sights and mr lorry looked in vain for the fulfilment of miss pross s prediction dinner time and still no hundreds of people in the arrangements of the little household miss pross took charge of the lower regions and always acquitted herself marvellously her dinners of a very modest quality were so well cooked and so well served and so neat in their contrivances half english and half french that nothing could be better miss pross s friendship being of the thoroughly practical kind she had ravaged soho and the adjacent provinces in search of impoverished french who tempted by shillings and half crowns would impart culinary mysteries to her from these decayed sons and daughters of gaul she had acquired such wonderful arts that the woman and girl who formed the staff of domestics regarded her as quite a sorceress or cinderella s godmother who would send out for a fowl a rabbit a vegetable or two from the garden and change them into anything she pleased on sundays miss pross dined at the doctor s table but on other days persisted in taking her meals at unknown periods either in the lower regions or in her own room on the second floor a blue chamber to which no one but her ladybird ever gained admittance on this occasion miss pross responding to ladybird s pleasant face and pleasant efforts to please her unbent exceedingly so the dinner was very pleasant too it was an oppressive day and after dinner lucie proposed that the wine should be carried out under the plane tree and they should sit there in the air as everything turned upon her and revolved about her they went out under the plane tree and she carried the wine down for the special benefit of mr lorry she had installed herself some time before as mr lorry s cup bearer and while they sat under the plane tree talking she kept his glass replenished mysterious backs and ends of houses peeped at them as they talked and the plane tree whispered to them in its own way above their heads still the hundreds of people did not present themselves mr darnay presented himself while they were sitting under the plane tree but he was only one doctor manette received him kindly and so did lucie but miss pross suddenly became afflicted with a twitching in the head and body and retired into the house she was not unfrequently the victim of this disorder and she called it in familiar conversation a fit of the jerks the doctor was in his best condition and looked specially young the resemblance between him and lucie was very strong at such times and as they sat side by side she leaning on his shoulder and he resting his arm on the back of her chair it was very agreeable to trace the likeness he had been talking all day on many subjects and with unusual vivacity pray doctor manette said mr darnay as they sat under the plane tree and he said it in the natural pursuit of the topic in hand which happened to be the old buildings of london have you seen much of the tower lucie and i have been there but only casually we have seen enough of it to know that it teems with interest little more i have been there as you remember said darnay with a smile though reddening a little angrily in another character and not in a character that gives facilities for seeing much of it they told me a curious thing when i was there what was that lucie asked in making some alterations the workmen came upon an old dungeon which had been for many years built up and forgotten every stone of its inner wall was covered by inscriptions which had been carved by prisoners dates names complaints and prayers upon a corner stone in an angle of the wall one prisoner who seemed to have gone to execution had cut as his last work three letters they were done with some very poor instrument and hurriedly with an unsteady hand at first they were read as d i c but on being more carefully examined the last letter was found to be g there was no record or legend of any prisoner with those initials and many fruitless guesses were made what the name could have been at length it was suggested that the letters were not initials but the complete word dig the floor was examined very carefully under the inscription and in the earth beneath a stone or tile or some fragment of paving were found the ashes of a paper mingled with the ashes of a small leathern case or bag what the unknown prisoner had written will never be read but he had written something and hidden it away to keep it from the gaoler my father exclaimed lucie you are ill he had suddenly started up with his hand to his head his manner and his look quite terrified them all no my dear not ill there are large drops of rain falling and they made me start we had better go in he recovered himself almost instantly rain was really falling in large drops and he showed the back of his hand with rain drops on it but he said not a single word in reference to the discovery that had been told of and as they went into the house the business eye of mr lorry either detected or fancied it detected on his face as it turned towards charles darnay the same singular look that had been upon it when it turned towards him in the passages of the court house he recovered himself so quickly however that mr lorry had doubts of his business eye the arm of the golden giant in the hall was not more steady than he was when he stopped under it to remark to them that he was not yet proof against slight surprises if he ever would be and that the rain had startled him tea time and miss pross making tea with another fit of the jerks upon her and yet no hundreds of people mr carton had lounged in but he made only two the night was so very sultry that although they sat with doors and windows open they were overpowered by heat when the tea table was done with they all moved to one of the windows and looked out into the heavy twilight lucie sat by her father darnay sat beside her carton leaned against a window the curtains were long and white and some of the thunder gusts that whirled into the corner caught them up to the ceiling and waved them like spectral wings the rain drops are still falling large heavy and few said doctor manette it comes slowly it comes surely said carton they spoke low as people watching and waiting mostly do as people in a dark room watching and waiting for lightning always do there was a great hurry in the streets of people speeding away to get shelter before the storm broke the wonderful corner for echoes resounded with the echoes of footsteps coming and going yet not a footstep was there a multitude of people and yet a solitude said darnay when they had listened for a while is it not impressive mr darnay asked lucie sometimes i have sat here of an evening until i have fancied but even the shade of a foolish fancy makes me shudder to night when all is so black and solemn let us shudder too we may know what it is it will seem nothing to you such whims are only impressive as we originate them i think they are not to be communicated i have sometimes sat alone here of an evening listening until i have made the echoes out to be the echoes of all the footsteps that are coming by and bye into our lives there is a great crowd coming one day into our lives if that be so sydney carton struck in in his moody way the footsteps were incessant and the hurry of them became more and more rapid the corner echoed and re echoed with the tread of feet some as it seemed under the windows some as it seemed in the room some coming some going some breaking off some stopping altogether all in the distant streets and not one within sight are all these footsteps destined to come to all of us miss manette or are we to divide them among us i don t know mr darnay i told you it was a foolish fancy but you asked for it when i have yielded myself to it i have been alone and then i have imagined them the footsteps of the people who are to come into my life and my father s i take them into mine said carton i ask no questions and make no stipulations there is a great crowd bearing down upon us miss manette and i see them by the lightning he added the last words after there had been a vivid flash which had shown him lounging in the window and i hear them he added again after a peal of thunder here they come fast fierce and furious it was the rush and roar of rain that he typified and it stopped him for no voice could be heard in it a memorable storm of thunder and lightning broke with that sweep of water and there was not a moment s interval in crash and fire and rain until after the moon rose at midnight the great bell of saint paul s was striking one in the cleared air when mr lorry escorted by jerry high booted and bearing a lantern set forth on his return passage to clerkenwell there were solitary patches of road on the way between soho and clerkenwell and mr lorry mindful of foot pads always retained jerry for this service though it was usually performed a good two hours earlier what a night it has been almost a night jerry said mr lorry to bring the dead out of their graves i never see the night myself master nor yet i don t expect to what would do that answered jerry good night mr carton said the man of business good night mr darnay shall we ever see such a night again together perhaps perhaps see the great crowd of people with its rush and roar bearing down upon them too monseigneur one of the great lords in power at the court held his fortnightly reception in his grand hotel in paris monseigneur was in his inner room his sanctuary of sanctuaries the holiest of holiests to the crowd of worshippers in the suite of rooms without monseigneur was about to take his chocolate monseigneur could swallow a great many things with ease and was by some few sullen minds supposed to be rather rapidly swallowing france but his morning s chocolate could not so much as get into the throat of monseigneur without the aid of four strong men besides the cook yes it took four men all four ablaze with gorgeous decoration and the chief of them unable to exist with fewer than two gold watches in his pocket emulative of the noble and chaste fashion set by monseigneur to conduct the happy chocolate to monseigneur s lips one lacquey carried the chocolate pot into the sacred presence a second milled and frothed the chocolate with the little instrument he bore for that function a third presented the favoured napkin a fourth he of the two gold watches poured the chocolate out it was impossible for monseigneur to dispense with one of these attendants on the chocolate and hold his high place under the admiring heavens deep would have been the blot upon his escutcheon if his chocolate had been ignobly waited on by only three men he must have died of two monseigneur had been out at a little supper last night where the comedy and the grand opera were charmingly represented monseigneur was out at a little supper most nights with fascinating company so polite and so impressible was monseigneur that the comedy and the grand opera had far more influence with him in the tiresome articles of state affairs and state secrets than the needs of all france a happy circumstance for france as the like always is for all countries similarly favoured always was for england by way of example in the regretted days of the merry stuart who sold it monseigneur had one truly noble idea of general public business which was to let everything go on in its own way of particular public business monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that it must all go his way tend to his own power and pocket of his pleasures general and particular monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that the world was made for them the text of his order altered from the original by only a pronoun which is not much ran the earth and the fulness thereof are mine saith monseigneur yet monseigneur had slowly found that vulgar embarrassments crept into his affairs both private and public and he had as to both classes of affairs allied himself perforce with a farmer general as to finances public because monseigneur could not make anything at all of them and must consequently let them out to somebody who could as to finances private because farmer generals were rich and monseigneur after generations of great luxury and expense was growing poor hence monseigneur had taken his sister from a convent while there was yet time to ward off the impending veil the cheapest garment she could wear and had bestowed her as a prize upon a very rich farmer general poor in family which farmer general carrying an appropriate cane with a golden apple on the top of it was now among the company in the outer rooms much prostrated before by mankind always excepting superior mankind of the blood of monseigneur who his own wife included looked down upon him with the loftiest contempt a sumptuous man was the farmer general thirty horses stood in his stables twenty four male domestics sat in his halls six body women waited on his wife as one who pretended to do nothing but plunder and forage where he could the farmer general howsoever his matrimonial relations conduced to social morality was at least the greatest reality among the personages who attended at the hotel of monseigneur that day for the rooms though a beautiful scene to look at and adorned with every device of decoration that the taste and skill of the time could achieve were in truth not a sound business considered with any reference to the scarecrows in the rags and nightcaps elsewhere and not so far off either but that the watching towers of notre dame almost equidistant from the two extremes could see them both they would have been an exceedingly uncomfortable business if that could have been anybody s business at the house of monseigneur military officers destitute of military knowledge naval officers with no idea of a ship civil officers without a notion of affairs brazen ecclesiastics of the worst world worldly with sensual eyes loose tongues and looser lives all totally unfit for their several callings all lying horribly in pretending to belong to them but all nearly or remotely of the order of monseigneur and therefore foisted on all public employments from which anything was to be got these were to be told off by the score and the score people not immediately connected with monseigneur or the state yet equally unconnected with anything that was real or with lives passed in travelling by any straight road to any true earthly end were no less abundant doctors who made great fortunes out of dainty remedies for imaginary disorders that never existed smiled upon their courtly patients in the ante chambers of monseigneur projectors who had discovered every kind of remedy for the little evils with which the state was touched except the remedy of setting to work in earnest to root out a single sin poured their distracting babble into any ears they could lay hold of at the reception of monseigneur unbelieving philosophers who were remodelling the world with words and making card towers of babel to scale the skies with talked with unbelieving chemists who had an eye on the transmutation of metals at this wonderful gathering accumulated by monseigneur exquisite gentlemen of the finest breeding which was at that remarkable time and has been since to be known by its fruits of indifference to every natural subject of human interest were in the most exemplary state of exhaustion at the hotel of monseigneur such homes had these various notabilities left behind them in the fine world of paris that the spies among the assembled devotees of monseigneur forming a goodly half of the polite company would have found it hard to discover among the angels of that sphere one solitary wife who in her manners and appearance owned to being a mother indeed except for the mere act of bringing a troublesome creature into this world which does not go far towards the realisation of the name of mother there was no such thing known to the fashion peasant women kept the unfashionable babies close and brought them up and charming grandmammas of sixty dressed and supped as at twenty the leprosy of unreality disfigured every human creature in attendance upon monseigneur in the outermost room were half a dozen exceptional people who had had for a few years some vague misgiving in them that things in general were going rather wrong as a promising way of setting them right half of the half dozen had become members of a fantastic sect of convulsionists and were even then considering within themselves whether they should foam rage roar and turn cataleptic on the spot thereby setting up a highly intelligible finger post to the future for monseigneur s guidance besides these dervishes were other three who had rushed into another sect which mended matters with a jargon about the centre of truth holding that man had got out of the centre of truth which did not need much demonstration but had not got out of the circumference and that he was to be kept from flying out of the circumference and was even to be shoved back into the centre by fasting and seeing of spirits among these accordingly much discoursing with spirits went on and it did a world of good which never became manifest but the comfort was that all the company at the grand hotel of monseigneur were perfectly dressed if the day of judgment had only been ascertained to be a dress day everybody there would have been eternally correct such frizzling and powdering and sticking up of hair such delicate complexions artificially preserved and mended such gallant swords to look at and such delicate honour to the sense of smell would surely keep anything going for ever and ever the exquisite gentlemen of the finest breeding wore little pendent trinkets that chinked as they languidly moved these golden fetters rang like precious little bells and what with that ringing and with the rustle of silk and brocade and fine linen there was a flutter in the air that fanned saint antoine and his devouring hunger far away dress was the one unfailing talisman and charm used for keeping all things in their places everybody was dressed for a fancy ball that was never to leave off from the palace of the tuileries through monseigneur and the whole court through the chambers the tribunals of justice and all society except the scarecrows the fancy ball descended to the common executioner who in pursuance of the charm was required to officiate frizzled powdered in a gold laced coat pumps and white silk stockings at the gallows and the wheel the axe was a rarity monsieur paris as it was the episcopal mode among his brother professors of the provinces monsieur orleans and the rest to call him presided in this dainty dress and who among the company at monseigneur s reception in that seventeen hundred and eightieth year of our lord could possibly doubt that a system rooted in a frizzled hangman powdered gold laced pumped and white silk stockinged would see the very stars out monseigneur having eased his four men of their burdens and taken his chocolate caused the doors of the holiest of holiests to be thrown open and issued forth then what submission what cringing and fawning what servility what abject humiliation as to bowing down in body and spirit nothing in that way was left for heaven which may have been one among other reasons why the worshippers of monseigneur never troubled it bestowing a word of promise here and a smile there a whisper on one happy slave and a wave of the hand on another monseigneur affably passed through his rooms to the remote region of the circumference of truth there monseigneur turned and came back again and so in due course of time got himself shut up in his sanctuary by the chocolate sprites and was seen no more the show being over the flutter in the air became quite a little storm and the precious little bells went ringing downstairs there was soon but one person left of all the crowd and he with his hat under his arm and his snuff box in his hand slowly passed among the mirrors on his way out i devote you said this person stopping at the last door on his way and turning in the direction of the sanctuary to the devil with that he shook the snuff from his fingers as if he had shaken the dust from his feet and quietly walked downstairs he was a man of about sixty
CD(...2Cities),group when it was done some diamonds very bright and sparkling glanced on the bride s hand which were newly released from the dark obscurity of one of mr lorry s pockets they returned home to breakfast and all went well and in due course the golden hair that had mingled with the poor shoemaker s white locks in the paris garret were mingled with them again in the morning sunlight on the threshold of the door at parting it was a hard parting though it was not for long but her father cheered her and said at last gently disengaging himself from her enfolding arms take her charles she is yours and her agitated hand waved to them from a chaise window and she was gone the corner being out of the way of the idle and curious and the preparations having been very simple and few the doctor mr lorry and miss pross were left quite alone it was when they turned into the welcome shade of the cool old hall that mr lorry observed a great change to have come over the doctor as if the golden arm uplifted there had struck him a poisoned blow he had naturally repressed much and some revulsion might have been expected in him when the occasion for repression was gone but it was the old scared lost look that troubled mr lorry and through his absent manner of clasping his head and drearily wandering away into his own room when they got up stairs mr lorry was reminded of defarge the wine shop keeper and the starlight ride i think he whispered to miss pross after anxious consideration i think we had best not speak to him just now or at all disturb him i must look in at tellson s so i will go there at once and come back presently then we will take him a ride into the country and dine there and all will be well it was easier for mr lorry to look in at tellson s than to look out of tellson s he was detained two hours when he came back he ascended the old staircase alone having asked no question of the servant going thus into the doctor s rooms he was stopped by a low sound of knocking good god he said with a start what s that miss pross with a terrified face was at his ear o me o me all is lost cried she wringing her hands what is to be told to ladybird he doesn t know me and is making shoes mr lorry said what he could to calm her and went himself into the doctor s room the bench was turned towards the light as it had been when he had seen the shoemaker at his work before and his head was bent down and he was very busy doctor manette my dear friend doctor manette the doctor looked at him for a moment half inquiringly half as if he were angry at being spoken to and bent over his work again he had laid aside his coat and waistcoat his shirt was open at the throat as it used to be when he did that work and even the old haggard faded surface of face had come back to him he worked hard impatiently as if in some sense of having been interrupted mr lorry glanced at the work in his hand and observed that it was a shoe of the old size and shape he took up another that was lying by him and asked what it was a young lady s walking shoe he muttered without looking up it ought to have been finished long ago let it be but doctor manette look at me he obeyed in the old mechanically submissive manner without pausing in his work you know me my dear friend think again this is not your proper occupation think dear friend nothing would induce him to speak more he looked up for an instant at a time when he was requested to do so but no persuasion would extract a word from him he worked and worked and worked in silence and words fell on him as they would have fallen on an echoless wall or on the air the only ray of hope that mr lorry could discover was that he sometimes furtively looked up without being asked in that there seemed a faint expression of curiosity or perplexity as though he were trying to reconcile some doubts in his mind two things at once impressed themselves on mr lorry as important above all others the first that this must be kept secret from lucie the second that it must be kept secret from all who knew him in conjunction with miss pross he took immediate steps towards the latter precaution by giving out that the doctor was not well and required a few days of complete rest in aid of the kind deception to be practised on his daughter miss pross was to write describing his having been called away professionally and referring to an imaginary letter of two or three hurried lines in his own hand represented to have been addressed to her by the same post these measures advisable to be taken in any case mr lorry took in the hope of his coming to himself if that should happen soon he kept another course in reserve which was to have a certain opinion that he thought the best on the doctor s case in the hope of his recovery and of resort to this third course being thereby rendered practicable mr lorry resolved to watch him attentively with as little appearance as possible of doing so he therefore made arrangements to absent himself from tellson s for the first time in his life and took his post by the window in the same room he was not long in discovering that it was worse than useless to speak to him since on being pressed he became worried he abandoned that attempt on the first day and resolved merely to keep himself always before him as a silent protest against the delusion into which he had fallen or was falling he remained therefore in his seat near the window reading and writing and expressing in as many pleasant and natural ways as he could think of that it was a free place doctor manette took what was given him to eat and drink and worked on that first day until it was too dark to see worked on half an hour after mr lorry could not have seen for his life to read or write when he put his tools aside as useless until morning mr lorry rose and said to him will you go out he looked down at the floor on either side of him in the old manner looked up in the old manner and repeated in the old low voice out yes for a walk with me why not he made no effort to say why not and said not a word more but mr lorry thought he saw as he leaned forward on his bench in the dusk with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands that he was in some misty way asking himself why not the sagacity of the man of business perceived an advantage here and determined to hold it miss pross and he divided the night into two watches and observed him at intervals from the adjoining room he paced up and down for a long time before he lay down but when he did finally lay himself down he fell asleep in the morning he was up betimes and went straight to his bench and to work on this second day mr lorry saluted him cheerfully by his name and spoke to him on topics that had been of late familiar to them he returned no reply but it was evident that he heard what was said and that he thought about it however confusedly this encouraged mr lorry to have miss pross in with her work several times during the day at those times they quietly spoke of lucie and of her father then present precisely in the usual manner and as if there were nothing amiss this was done without any demonstrative accompaniment not long enough or often enough to harass him and it lightened mr lorry s friendly heart to believe that he looked up oftener and that he appeared to be stirred by some perception of inconsistencies surrounding him when it fell dark again mr lorry asked him as before dear doctor will you go out as before he repeated out yes for a walk with me why not this time mr lorry feigned to go out when he could extract no answer from him and after remaining absent for an hour returned in the meanwhile the doctor had removed to the seat in the window and had sat there looking down at the plane tree but on mr lorry s return he slipped away to his bench the time went very slowly on and mr lorry s hope darkened and his heart grew heavier again and grew yet heavier and heavier every day the third day came and went the fourth the fifth five days six days seven days eight days nine days with a hope ever darkening and with a heart always growing heavier and heavier mr lorry passed through this anxious time the secret was well kept and lucie was unconscious and happy but he could not fail to observe that the shoemaker whose hand had been a little out at first was growing dreadfully skilful and that he had never been so intent on his work and that his hands had never been so nimble and expert as in the dusk of the ninth evening worn out by anxious watching mr lorry fell asleep at his post on the tenth morning of his suspense he was startled by the shining of the sun into the room where a heavy slumber had overtaken him when it was dark night he rubbed his eyes and roused himself but he doubted when he had done so whether he was not still asleep for going to the door of the doctor s room and looking in he perceived that the shoemaker s bench and tools were put aside again and that the doctor himself sat reading at the window he was in his usual morning dress and his face which mr lorry could distinctly see though still very pale was calmly studious and attentive even when he had satisfied himself that he was awake mr lorry felt giddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking might not be a disturbed dream of his own for did not his eyes show him his friend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect and employed as usual and was there any sign within their range that the change of which he had so strong an impression had actually happened it was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment the answer being obvious if the impression were not produced by a real corresponding and sufficient cause how came he jarvis lorry there how came he to have fallen asleep in his clothes on the sofa in doctor manette s consulting room and to be debating these points outside the doctor s bedroom door in the early morning within a few minutes miss pross stood whispering at his side if he had had any particle of doubt left her talk would of necessity have resolved it but he was by that time clear headed and had none he advised that they should let the time go by until the regular breakfast hour and should then meet the doctor as if nothing unusual had occurred if he appeared to be in his customary state of mind mr lorry would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from the opinion he had been in his anxiety so anxious to obtain miss pross submitting herself to his judgment the scheme was worked out with care having abundance of time for his usual methodical toilette mr lorry presented himself at the breakfast hour in his usual white linen and with his usual neat leg the doctor was summoned in the usual way and came to breakfast so far as it was possible to comprehend him without overstepping those delicate and gradual approaches which mr lorry felt to be the only safe advance he at first supposed that his daughter s marriage had taken place yesterday an incidental allusion purposely thrown out to the day of the week and the day of the month set him thinking and counting and evidently made him uneasy in all other respects however he was so composedly himself that mr lorry determined to have the aid he sought and that aid was his own therefore when the breakfast was done and cleared away and he and the doctor were left together mr lorry said feelingly my dear manette i am anxious to have your opinion in confidence on a very curious case in which i am deeply interested that is to say it is very curious to me perhaps to your better information it may be less so glancing at his hands which were discoloured by his late work the doctor looked troubled and listened attentively he had already glanced at his hands more than once doctor manette said mr lorry touching him affectionately on the arm the case is the case of a particularly dear friend of mine pray give your mind to it and advise me well for his sake and above all for his daughter s his daughter s my dear manette if i understand said the doctor in a subdued tone some mental shock yes be explicit said the doctor spare no detail mr lorry saw that they understood one another and proceeded my dear manette it is the case of an old and a prolonged shock of great acuteness and severity to the affections the feelings the the as you express it the mind the mind it is the case of a shock under which the sufferer was borne down one cannot say for how long because i believe he cannot calculate the time himself and there are no other means of getting at it it is the case of a shock from which the sufferer recovered by a process that he cannot trace himself as i once heard him publicly relate in a striking manner it is the case of a shock from which he has recovered so completely as to be a highly intelligent man capable of close application of mind and great exertion of body and of constantly making fresh additions to his stock of knowledge which was already very large but unfortunately there has been he paused and took a deep breath a slight relapse the doctor in a low voice asked of how long duration nine days and nights how did it show itself i infer glancing at his hands again in the resumption of some old pursuit connected with the shock that is the fact now did you ever see him asked the doctor distinctly and collectedly though in the same low voice engaged in that pursuit originally once and when the relapse fell on him was he in most respects or in all respects as he was then i think in all respects you spoke of his daughter does his daughter know of the relapse no it has been kept from her and i hope will always be kept from her it is known only to myself and to one other who may be trusted the doctor grasped his hand and murmured that was very kind that was very thoughtful mr lorry grasped his hand in return and neither of the two spoke for a little while now my dear manette said mr lorry at length in his most considerate and most affectionate way i am a mere man of business and unfit to cope with such intricate and difficult matters i do not possess the kind of information necessary i do not possess the kind of intelligence i want guiding there is no man in this world on whom i could so rely for right guidance as on you tell me how does this relapse come about is there danger of another could a repetition of it be prevented how should a repetition of it be treated how does it come about at all what can i do for my friend no man ever can have been more desirous in his heart to serve a friend than i am to serve mine if i knew how but i don t know how to originate in such a case if your sagacity knowledge and experience could put me on the right track i might be able to do so much unenlightened and undirected i can do so little pray discuss it with me pray enable me to see it a little more clearly and teach me how to be a little more useful doctor manette sat meditating after these earnest words were spoken and mr lorry did not press him i think it probable said the doctor breaking silence with an effort that the relapse you have described my dear friend was not quite unforeseen by its subject was it dreaded by him mr lorry ventured to ask very much he said it with an involuntary shudder you have no idea how such an apprehension weighs on the sufferer s mind and how difficult how almost impossible it is for him to force himself to utter a word upon the topic that oppresses him would he asked mr lorry be sensibly relieved if he could prevail upon himself to impart that secret brooding to any one when it is on him i think so but it is as i have told you next to impossible i even believe it in some cases to be quite impossible now said mr lorry gently laying his hand on the doctor s arm again after a short silence on both sides to what would you refer this attack i believe returned doctor manette that there had been a strong and extraordinary revival of the train of thought and remembrance that was the first cause of the malady some intense associations of a most distressing nature were vividly recalled i think it is probable that there had long been a dread lurking in his mind that those associations would be recalled say under certain circumstances say on a particular occasion he tried to prepare himself in vain perhaps the effort to prepare himself made him less able to bear it would he remember what took place in the relapse asked mr lorry with natural hesitation the doctor looked desolately round the room shook his head and answered in a low voice not at all now as to the future hinted mr lorry as to the future said the doctor recovering firmness i should have great hope as it pleased heaven in its mercy to restore him so soon i should have great hope he yielding under the pressure of a complicated something long dreaded and long vaguely foreseen and contended against and recovering after the cloud had burst and passed i should hope that the worst was over well well that s good comfort i am thankful said mr lorry i am thankful repeated the doctor bending his head with reverence there are two other points said mr lorry on which i am anxious to be instructed i may go on you cannot do your friend a better service the doctor gave him his hand to the first then he is of a studious habit and unusually energetic he applies himself with great ardour to the acquisition of professional knowledge to the conducting of experiments to many things now does he do too much i think not it may be the character of his mind to be always in singular need of occupation that may be in part natural to it in part the result of affliction the less it was occupied with healthy things the more it would be in danger of turning in the unhealthy direction he may have observed himself and made the discovery you are sure that he is not under too great a strain i think i am quite sure of it my dear manette if he were overworked now my dear lorry i doubt if that could easily be there has been a violent stress in one direction and it needs a counterweight excuse me as a persistent man of business assuming for a moment that he was overworked it would show itself in some renewal of this disorder i do not think so i do not think said doctor manette with the firmness of self conviction that anything but the one train of association would renew it i think that henceforth nothing but some extraordinary jarring of that chord could renew it after what has happened and after his recovery i find it difficult to imagine any such violent sounding of that string again i trust and i almost believe that the circumstances likely to renew it are exhausted he spoke with the diffidence of a man who knew how slight a thing would overset the delicate organisation of the mind and yet with the confidence of a man who had slowly won his assurance out of personal endurance and distress it was not for his friend to abate that confidence he professed himself more relieved and encouraged than he really was and approached his second and last point he felt it to be the most difficult of all but remembering his old sunday morning conversation with miss pross and remembering what he had seen in the last nine days he knew that he must face it the occupation resumed under the influence of this passing affliction so happily recovered from said mr lorry clearing his throat we will call blacksmith s work blacksmith s work we will say to put a case and for the sake of illustration that he had been used in his bad time to work at a little forge we will say that he was unexpectedly found at his forge again is it not a pity that he should keep it by him the doctor shaded his forehead with his hand and beat his foot nervously on the ground he has always kept it by him said mr lorry with an anxious look at his friend now would it not be better that he should let it go still the doctor with shaded forehead beat his foot nervously on the ground you do not find it easy to advise me said mr lorry i quite understand it to be a nice question and yet i think and there he shook his head and stopped you see said doctor manette turning to him after an uneasy pause it is very hard to explain consistently the innermost workings of this poor man s mind he once yearned so frightfully for that occupation and it was so welcome when it came no doubt it relieved his pain so much by substituting the perplexity of the fingers for the perplexity of the brain and by substituting as he became more practised the ingenuity of the hands for the ingenuity of the mental torture that he has never been able to bear the thought of putting it quite out of his reach even now when i believe he is more hopeful of himself than he has ever been and even speaks of himself with a kind of confidence the idea
CD(...2Cities),and stifled by the bunches of grass and straw that were thrust into his face by hundreds of hands torn bruised panting bleeding yet always entreating and beseeching for mercy now full of vehement agony of action with a small clear space about him as the people drew one another back that they might see now a log of dead wood drawn through a forest of legs he was hauled to the nearest street corner where one of the fatal lamps swung and there madame defarge let him go as a cat might have done to a mouse and silently and composedly looked at him while they made ready and while he besought her the women passionately screeching at him all the time and the men sternly calling out to have him killed with grass in his mouth once he went aloft and the rope broke and they caught him shrieking twice he went aloft and the rope broke and they caught him shrieking then the rope was merciful and held him and his head was soon upon a pike with grass enough in the mouth for all saint antoine to dance at the sight of nor was this the end of the day s bad work for saint antoine so shouted and danced his angry blood up that it boiled again on hearing when the day closed in that the son in law of the despatched another of the people s enemies and insulters was coming into paris under a guard five hundred strong in cavalry alone saint antoine wrote his crimes on flaring sheets of paper seized him would have torn him out of the breast of an army to bear foulon company set his head and heart on pikes and carried the three spoils of the day in wolf procession through the streets not before dark night did the men and women come back to the children wailing and breadless then the miserable bakers shops were beset by long files of them patiently waiting to buy bad bread and while they waited with stomachs faint and empty they beguiled the time by embracing one another on the triumphs of the day and achieving them again in gossip gradually these strings of ragged people shortened and frayed away and then poor lights began to shine in high windows and slender fires were made in the streets at which neighbours cooked in common afterwards supping at their doors scanty and insufficient suppers those and innocent of meat as of most other sauce to wretched bread yet human fellowship infused some nourishment into the flinty viands and struck some sparks of cheerfulness out of them fathers and mothers who had had their full share in the worst of the day played gently with their meagre children and lovers with such a world around them and before them loved and hoped it was almost morning when defarge s wine shop parted with its last knot of customers and monsieur defarge said to madame his wife in husky tones while fastening the door at last it is come my dear eh well returned madame almost saint antoine slept the defarges slept even the vengeance slept with her starved grocer and the drum was at rest the drum s was the only voice in saint antoine that blood and hurry had not changed the vengeance as custodian of the drum could have wakened him up and had the same speech out of him as before the bastille fell or old foulon was seized not so with the hoarse tones of the men and women in saint antoine s bosom there was a change on the village where the fountain fell and where the mender of roads went forth daily to hammer out of the stones on the highway such morsels of bread as might serve for patches to hold his poor ignorant soul and his poor reduced body together the prison on the crag was not so dominant as of yore there were soldiers to guard it but not many there were officers to guard the soldiers but not one of them knew what his men would do beyond this that it would probably not be what he was ordered far and wide lay a ruined country yielding nothing but desolation every green leaf every blade of grass and blade of grain was as shrivelled and poor as the miserable people everything was bowed down dejected oppressed and broken habitations fences domesticated animals men women children and the soil that bore them all worn out monseigneur often a most worthy individual gentleman was a national blessing gave a chivalrous tone to things was a polite example of luxurious and shining life and a great deal more to equal purpose nevertheless monseigneur as a class had somehow or other brought things to this strange that creation designed expressly for monseigneur should be so soon wrung dry and squeezed out there must be something short sighted in the eternal arrangements surely thus it was however and the last drop of blood having been extracted from the flints and the last screw of the rack having been turned so often that its purchase crumbled and it now turned and turned with nothing to bite monseigneur began to run away from a phenomenon so low and unaccountable but this was not the change on the village and on many a village like it for scores of years gone by monseigneur had squeezed it and wrung it and had seldom graced it with his presence except for the pleasures of the chase now found in hunting the people now found in hunting the beasts for whose preservation monseigneur made edifying spaces of barbarous and barren wilderness no the change consisted in the appearance of strange faces of low caste rather than in the disappearance of the high caste chiselled and otherwise beautified and beautifying features of monseigneur for in these times as the mender of roads worked solitary in the dust not often troubling himself to reflect that dust he was and to dust he must return being for the most part too much occupied in thinking how little he had for supper and how much more he would eat if he had it in these times as he raised his eyes from his lonely labour and viewed the prospect he would see some rough figure approaching on foot the like of which was once a rarity in those parts but was now a frequent presence as it advanced the mender of roads would discern without surprise that it was a shaggy haired man of almost barbarian aspect tall in wooden shoes that were clumsy even to the eyes of a mender of roads grim rough swart steeped in the mud and dust of many highways dank with the marshy moisture of many low grounds sprinkled with the thorns and leaves and moss of many byways through woods such a man came upon him like a ghost at noon in the july weather as he sat on his heap of stones under a bank taking such shelter as he could get from a shower of hail the man looked at him looked at the village in the hollow at the mill and at the prison on the crag when he had identified these objects in what benighted mind he had he said in a dialect that was just intelligible how goes it jacques all well jacques touch then they joined hands and the man sat down on the heap of stones no dinner nothing but supper now said the mender of roads with a hungry face it is the fashion growled the man i meet no dinner anywhere he took out a blackened pipe filled it lighted it with flint and steel pulled at it until it was in a bright glow then suddenly held it from him and dropped something into it from between his finger and thumb that blazed and went out in a puff of smoke touch then it was the turn of the mender of roads to say it this time after observing these operations they again joined hands to night said the mender of roads to night said the man putting the pipe in his mouth where here he and the mender of roads sat on the heap of stones looking silently at one another with the hail driving in between them like a pigmy charge of bayonets until the sky began to clear over the village show me said the traveller then moving to the brow of the hill see returned the mender of roads with extended finger you go down here and straight through the street and past the fountain to the devil with all that interrupted the other rolling his eye over the landscape i go through no streets and past no fountains well well about two leagues beyond the summit of that hill above the village good when do you cease to work at sunset will you wake me before departing i have walked two nights without resting let me finish my pipe and i shall sleep like a child will you wake me surely the wayfarer smoked his pipe out put it in his breast slipped off his great wooden shoes and lay down on his back on the heap of stones he was fast asleep directly as the road mender plied his dusty labour and the hail clouds rolling away revealed bright bars and streaks of sky which were responded to by silver gleams upon the landscape the little man who wore a red cap now in place of his blue one seemed fascinated by the figure on the heap of stones his eyes were so often turned towards it that he used his tools mechanically and one would have said to very poor account the bronze face the shaggy black hair and beard the coarse woollen red cap the rough medley dress of home spun stuff and hairy skins of beasts the powerful frame attenuated by spare living and the sullen and desperate compression of the lips in sleep inspired the mender of roads with awe the traveller had travelled far and his feet were footsore and his ankles chafed and bleeding his great shoes stuffed with leaves and grass had been heavy to drag over the many long leagues and his clothes were chafed into holes as he himself was into sores stooping down beside him the road mender tried to get a peep at secret weapons in his breast or where not but in vain for he slept with his arms crossed upon him and set as resolutely as his lips fortified towns with their stockades guard houses gates trenches and drawbridges seemed to the mender of roads to be so much air as against this figure and when he lifted his eyes from it to the horizon and looked around he saw in his small fancy similar figures stopped by no obstacle tending to centres all over france the man slept on indifferent to showers of hail and intervals of brightness to sunshine on his face and shadow to the paltering lumps of dull ice on his body and the diamonds into which the sun changed them until the sun was low in the west and the sky was glowing then the mender of roads having got his tools together and all things ready to go down into the village roused him good said the sleeper rising on his elbow two leagues beyond the summit of the hill about about good the mender of roads went home with the dust going on before him according to the set of the wind and was soon at the fountain squeezing himself in among the lean kine brought there to drink and appearing even to whisper to them in his whispering to all the village when the village had taken its poor supper it did not creep to bed as it usually did but came out of doors again and remained there a curious contagion of whispering was upon it and also when it gathered together at the fountain in the dark another curious contagion of looking expectantly at the sky in one direction only monsieur gabelle chief functionary of the place became uneasy went out on his house top alone and looked in that direction too glanced down from behind his chimneys at the darkening faces by the fountain below and sent word to the sacristan who kept the keys of the church that there might be need to ring the tocsin by and bye the night deepened the trees environing the old chateau keeping its solitary state apart moved in a rising wind as though they threatened the pile of building massive and dark in the gloom up the two terrace flights of steps the rain ran wildly and beat at the great door like a swift messenger rousing those within uneasy rushes of wind went through the hall among the old spears and knives and passed lamenting up the stairs and shook the curtains of the bed where the last marquis had slept east west north and south through the woods four heavy treading unkempt figures crushed the high grass and cracked the branches striding on cautiously to come together in the courtyard four lights broke out there and moved away in different directions and all was black again but not for long presently the chateau began to make itself strangely visible by some light of its own as though it were growing luminous then a flickering streak played behind the architecture of the front picking out transparent places and showing where balustrades arches and windows were then it soared higher and grew broader and brighter soon from a score of the great windows flames burst forth and the stone faces awakened stared out of fire a faint murmur arose about the house from the few people who were left there and there was a saddling of a horse and riding away there was spurring and splashing through the darkness and bridle was drawn in the space by the village fountain and the horse in a foam stood at monsieur gabelle s door help gabelle help every one the tocsin rang impatiently but other help if that were any there was none the mender of roads and two hundred and fifty particular friends stood with folded arms at the fountain looking at the pillar of fire in the sky it must be forty feet high said they grimly and never moved the rider from the chateau and the horse in a foam clattered away through the village and galloped up the stony steep to the prison on the crag at the gate a group of officers were looking at the fire removed from them a group of soldiers help gentlemen officers the chateau is on fire valuable objects may be saved from the flames by timely aid help help the officers looked towards the soldiers who looked at the fire gave no orders and answered with shrugs and biting of lips it must burn as the rider rattled down the hill again and through the street the village was illuminating the mender of roads and the two hundred and fifty particular friends inspired as one man and woman by the idea of lighting up had darted into their houses and were putting candles in every dull little pane of glass the general scarcity of everything occasioned candles to be borrowed in a rather peremptory manner of monsieur gabelle and in a moment of reluctance and hesitation on that functionary s part the mender of roads once so submissive to authority had remarked that carriages were good to make bonfires with and that post horses would roast the chateau was left to itself to flame and burn in the roaring and raging of the conflagration a red hot wind driving straight from the infernal regions seemed to be blowing the edifice away with the rising and falling of the blaze the stone faces showed as if they were in torment when great masses of stone and timber fell the face with the two dints in the nose became obscured anon struggled out of the smoke again as if it were the face of the cruel marquis burning at the stake and contending with the fire the chateau burned the nearest trees laid hold of by the fire scorched and shrivelled trees at a distance fired by the four fierce figures begirt the blazing edifice with a new forest of smoke molten lead and iron boiled in the marble basin of the fountain the water ran dry the extinguisher tops of the towers vanished like ice before the heat and trickled down into four rugged wells of flame great rents and splits branched out in the solid walls like crystallisation stupefied birds wheeled about and dropped into the furnace four fierce figures trudged away east west north and south along the night enshrouded roads guided by the beacon they had lighted towards their next destination the illuminated village had seized hold of the tocsin and abolishing the lawful ringer rang for joy not only that but the village light headed with famine fire and bell ringing and bethinking itself that monsieur gabelle had to do with the collection of rent and taxes though it was but a small instalment of taxes and no rent at all that gabelle had got in those latter days became impatient for an interview with him and surrounding his house summoned him to come forth for personal conference whereupon monsieur gabelle did heavily bar his door and retire to hold counsel with himself the result of that conference was that gabelle again withdrew himself to his housetop behind his stack of chimneys this time resolved if his door were broken in he was a small southern man of retaliative temperament to pitch himself head foremost over the parapet and crush a man or two below probably monsieur gabelle passed a long night up there with the distant chateau for fire and candle and the beating at his door combined with the joy ringing for music not to mention his having an ill omened lamp slung across the road before his posting house gate which the village showed a lively inclination to displace in his favour a trying suspense to be passing a whole summer night on the brink of the black ocean ready to take that plunge into it upon which monsieur gabelle had resolved but the friendly dawn appearing at last and the rush candles of the village guttering out the people happily dispersed and monsieur gabelle came down bringing his life with him for that while within a hundred miles and in the light of other fires there were other functionaries less fortunate that night and other nights whom the rising sun found hanging across once peaceful streets where they had been born and bred also there were other villagers and townspeople less fortunate than the mender of roads and his fellows upon whom the functionaries and soldiery turned with success and whom they strung up in their turn but the fierce figures were steadily wending east west north and south be that as it would and whosoever hung fire burned the altitude of the gallows that would turn to water and quench it no functionary by any stretch of mathematics was able to calculate successfully in such risings of fire and risings of sea the firm earth shaken by the rushes of an angry ocean which had now no ebb but was always on the flow higher and higher to the terror and wonder of the beholders on the shore three years of tempest were consumed three more birthdays of little lucie had been woven by the golden thread into the peaceful tissue of the life of her home many a night and many a day had its inmates listened to the echoes in the corner with hearts that failed them when they heard the thronging feet for the footsteps had become to their minds as the footsteps of a people tumultuous under a red flag and with their country declared in danger changed into wild beasts by terrible enchantment long persisted in monseigneur as a class had dissociated himself from the phenomenon of his not being appreciated of his being so little wanted in france as to incur considerable danger of receiving his dismissal from it and this life together like the fabled rustic who raised the devil with infinite pains and was so terrified at the sight of him that he could ask the enemy no question but immediately fled so monseigneur after boldly reading the lord s prayer backwards for a great number of years and performing many other potent spells for compelling the evil one no sooner beheld him in his terrors than he took to his noble heels the shining bull s eye of the court was gone or it would have been the mark for a hurricane of national bullets it had never been a good eye to see with had long had the mote in it of lucifer s pride sardanapalus s luxury and a mole s blindness but it had dropped out and was gone the court from that exclusive inner circle to its outermost rotten ring of intrigue corruption and dissimulation was all gone together royalty was gone had been besieged in its palace and suspended when the last tidings came over the august of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety two was come and monseigneur was by this time scattered far and wide as was natural the head quarters and great gathering place of monseigneur in london was tellson s bank spirits are supposed to haunt the places where their bodies most resorted and monseigneur without a guinea haunted the spot where his guineas used to be moreover it was the spot to which such french intelligence as was most to be relied upon came quickest again tellson s was a munificent house and extended great liberality to old customers who had fallen from their high estate again those nobles who had seen the coming storm in time and anticipating plunder or confiscation had made provident remittances to tellson s were always to be heard of there by their needy brethren to which it must be added that every new comer from france reported himself and his tidings at tellson s almost as a matter of course for such variety of reasons tellson s was at that time as to french intelligence a kind of high exchange and this was so well known to the public and the inquiries made there were in consequence so numerous that tellson s sometimes wrote the latest news out in a line or so and posted it in the bank windows for all who ran through temple bar to read on a steaming misty afternoon mr lorry sat at his desk and charles darnay stood leaning on it talking with him in a low voice the penitential den once set apart for interviews with the house was now the news exchange and was filled to overflowing it was within half an hour or so of the time of closing but although you are the youngest man that ever lived said charles darnay rather hesitating i must still suggest to you i understand that i am too old said mr lorry unsettled weather a long journey uncertain means of travelling a disorganised country a city that may not be even safe for you my dear charles said mr lorry with cheerful confidence you touch some of the reasons for my going not for my staying away it is safe enough for me nobody will care to interfere with an old fellow of hard

GE(Mddlem...),does it seem incongruous to you that a middlemarch surgeon should dream of himself as a discoverer most of us indeed know little of the great originators until they have been lifted up among the constellations and already rule our fates but that herschel for example who broke the barriers of the heavens did he not once play a provincial church organ and give music lessons to stumbling pianists each of those shining ones had to walk on the earth among neighbors who perhaps thought much more of his gait and his garments than of anything which was to give him a title to everlasting fame each of them had his little local personal history sprinkled with small temptations and sordid cares which made the retarding friction of his course towards final companionship with the immortals lydgate was not blind to the dangers of such friction but he had plenty of confidence in his resolution to avoid it as far as possible being seven and twenty he felt himself experienced and he was not going to have his vanities provoked by contact with the showy worldly successes of the capital but to live among people who could hold no rivalry with that pursuit of a great idea which was to be a twin object with the assiduous practice of his profession there was fascination in the hope that the two purposes would illuminate each other the careful observation and inference which was his daily work the use of the lens to further his judgment in special cases would further his thought as an instrument of larger inquiry was not this the typical pre eminence of his profession he would be a good middlemarch doctor and by that very means keep himself in the track of far reaching investigation on one point he may fairly claim approval at this particular stage of his career he did not mean to imitate those philanthropic models who make a profit out of poisonous pickles to support themselves while they are exposing adulteration or hold shares in a gambling hell that they may have leisure to represent the cause of public morality he intended to begin in his own case some particular reforms which were quite certainly within his reach and much less of a problem than the demonstrating of an anatomical conception one of these reforms was to act stoutly on the strength of a recent legal decision and simply prescribe without dispensing drugs or taking percentage from druggists this was an innovation for one who had chosen to adopt the style of general practitioner in a country town and would be felt as offensive criticism by his professional brethren but lydgate meant to innovate in his treatment also and he was wise enough to see that the best security for his practising honestly according to his belief was to get rid of systematic temptations to the contrary perhaps that was a more cheerful time for observers and theorizers than the present we are apt to think it the finest era of the world when america was beginning to be discovered when a bold sailor even if he were wrecked might alight on a new kingdom and about 1829 the dark territories of pathology were a fine america for a spirited young adventurer lydgate was ambitious above all to contribute towards enlarging the scientific rational basis of his profession the more he became interested in special questions of disease such as the nature of fever or fevers the more keenly he felt the need for that fundamental knowledge of structure which just at the beginning of the century had been illuminated by the brief and glorious career of bichat who died when he was only one and thirty but like another alexander left a realm large enough for many heirs that great frenchman first carried out the conception that living bodies fundamentally considered are not associations of organs which can be understood by studying them first apart and then as it were federally but must be regarded as consisting of certain primary webs or tissues out of which the various organs brain heart lungs and so on are compacted as the various accommodations of a house are built up in various proportions of wood iron stone brick zinc and the rest each material having its peculiar composition and proportions no man one sees can understand and estimate the entire structure or its parts what are its frailties and what its repairs without knowing the nature of the materials and the conception wrought out by bichat with his detailed study of the different tissues acted necessarily on medical questions as the turning of gas light would act on a dim oil lit street showing new connections and hitherto hidden facts of structure which must be taken into account in considering the symptoms of maladies and the action of medicaments but results which depend on human conscience and intelligence work slowly and now at the end of 1829 most medical practice was still strutting or shambling along the old paths and there was still scientific work to be done which might have seemed to be a direct sequence of bichat s this great seer did not go beyond the consideration of the tissues as ultimate facts in the living organism marking the limit of anatomical analysis but it was open to another mind to say have not these structures some common basis from which they have all started as your sarsnet gauze net satin and velvet from the raw cocoon here would be another light as of oxy hydrogen showing the very grain of things and revising all former explanations of this sequence to bichat s work already vibrating along many currents of the european mind lydgate was enamoured he longed to demonstrate the more intimate relations of living structure and help to define men s thought more accurately after the true order the work had not yet been done but only prepared for those who knew how to use the preparation what was the primitive tissue in that way lydgate put the question not quite in the way required by the awaiting answer but such missing of the right word befalls many seekers and he counted on quiet intervals to be watchfully seized for taking up the threads of investigation on many hints to be won from diligent application not only of the scalpel but of the microscope which research had begun to use again with new enthusiasm of reliance such was lydgate s plan of his future to do good small work for middlemarch and great work for the world he was certainly a happy fellow at this time to be seven and twenty without any fixed vices with a generous resolution that his action should be beneficent and with ideas in his brain that made life interesting quite apart from the cultus of horseflesh and other mystic rites of costly observance which the eight hundred pounds left him after buying his practice would certainly not have gone far in paying for he was at a starting point which makes many a man s career a fine subject for betting if there were any gentlemen given to that amusement who could appreciate the complicated probabilities of an arduous purpose with all the possible thwartings and furtherings of circumstance all the niceties of inward balance by which a man swims and makes his point or else is carried headlong the risk would remain even with close knowledge of lydgate s character for character too is a process and an unfolding the man was still in the making as much as the middlemarch doctor and immortal discoverer and there were both virtues and faults capable of shrinking or expanding the faults will not i hope be a reason for the withdrawal of your interest in him among our valued friends is there not some one or other who is a little too self confident and disdainful whose distinguished mind is a little spotted with commonness who is a little pinched here and protuberant there with native prejudices or whose better energies are liable to lapse down the wrong channel under the influence of transient solicitations all these things might be alleged against lydgate but then they are the periphrases of a polite preacher who talks of adam and would not like to mention anything painful to the pew renters the particular faults from which these delicate generalities are distilled have distinguishable physiognomies diction accent and grimaces filling up parts in very various dramas our vanities differ as our noses do all conceit is not the same conceit but varies in correspondence with the minutiae of mental make in which one of us differs from another lydgate s conceit was of the arrogant sort never simpering never impertinent but massive in its claims and benevolently contemptuous he would do a great deal for noodles being sorry for them and feeling quite sure that they could have no power over him he had thought of joining the saint simonians when he was in paris in order to turn them against some of their own doctrines all his faults were marked by kindred traits and were those of a man who had a fine baritone whose clothes hung well upon him and who even in his ordinary gestures had an air of inbred distinction where then lay the spots of commonness says a young lady enamoured of that careless grace how could there be any commonness in a man so well bred so ambitious of social distinction so generous and unusual in his views of social duty as easily as there may be stupidity in a man of genius if you take him unawares on the wrong subject or as many a man who has the best will to advance the social millennium might be ill inspired in imagining its lighter pleasures unable to go beyond offenbach s music or the brilliant punning in the last burlesque lydgate s spots of commonness lay in the complexion of his prejudices which in spite of noble intention and sympathy were half of them such as are found in ordinary men of the world that distinction of mind which belonged to his intellectual ardor did not penetrate his feeling and judgment about furniture or women or the desirability of its being known without his telling that he was better born than other country surgeons he did not mean to think of furniture at present but whenever he did so it was to be feared that neither biology nor schemes of reform would lift him above the vulgarity of feeling that there would be an incompatibility in his furniture not being of the best as to women he had once already been drawn headlong by impetuous folly which he meant to be final since marriage at some distant period would of course not be impetuous for those who want to be acquainted with lydgate it will be good to know what was that case of impetuous folly for it may stand as an example of the fitful swerving of passion to which he was prone together with the chivalrous kindness which helped to make him morally lovable the story can be told without many words it happened when he was studying in paris and just at the time when over and above his other work he was occupied with some galvanic experiments one evening tired with his experimenting and not being able to elicit the facts he needed he left his frogs and rabbits to some repose under their trying and mysterious dispensation of unexplained shocks and went to finish his evening at the theatre of the porte saint martin where there was a melodrama which he had already seen several times attracted not by the ingenious work of the collaborating authors but by an actress whose part it was to stab her lover mistaking him for the evil designing duke of the piece lydgate was in love with this actress as a man is in love with a woman whom he never expects to speak to she was a provencale with dark eyes a greek profile and rounded majestic form having that sort of beauty which carries a sweet matronliness even in youth and her voice was a soft cooing she had but lately come to paris and bore a virtuous reputation her husband acting with her as the unfortunate lover it was her acting which was no better than it should be but the public was satisfied lydgate s only relaxation now was to go and look at this woman just as he might have thrown himself under the breath of the sweet south on a bank of violets for a while without prejudice to his galvanism to which he would presently return but this evening the old drama had a new catastrophe at the moment when the heroine was to act the stabbing of her lover and he was to fall gracefully the wife veritably stabbed her husband who fell as death willed a wild shriek pierced the house and the provencale fell swooning a shriek and a swoon were demanded by the play but the swooning too was real this time lydgate leaped and climbed he hardly knew how on to the stage and was active in help making the acquaintance of his heroine by finding a contusion on her head and lifting her gently in his arms paris rang with the story of this death was it a murder some of the actress s warmest admirers were inclined to believe in her guilt and liked her the better for it such was the taste of those times but lydgate was not one of these he vehemently contended for her innocence and the remote impersonal passion for her beauty which he had felt before had passed now into personal devotion and tender thought of her lot the notion of murder was absurd no motive was discoverable the young couple being understood to dote on each other and it was not unprecedented that an accidental slip of the foot should have brought these grave consequences the legal investigation ended in madame laure s release lydgate by this time had had many interviews with her and found her more and more adorable she talked little but that was an additional charm she was melancholy and seemed grateful her presence was enough like that of the evening light lydgate was madly anxious about her affection and jealous lest any other man than himself should win it and ask her to marry him but instead of reopening her engagement at the porte saint martin where she would have been all the more popular for the fatal episode she left paris without warning forsaking her little court of admirers perhaps no one carried inquiry far except lydgate who felt that all science had come to a stand still while he imagined the unhappy laure stricken by ever wandering sorrow herself wandering and finding no faithful comforter hidden actresses however are not so difficult to find as some other hidden facts and it was not long before lydgate gathered indications that laure had taken the route to lyons he found her at last acting with great success at avignon under the same name looking more majestic than ever as a forsaken wife carrying her child in her arms he spoke to her after the play was received with the usual quietude which seemed to him beautiful as clear depths of water and obtained leave to visit her the next day when he was bent on telling her that he adored her and on asking her to marry him he knew that this was like the sudden impulse of a madman incongruous even with his habitual foibles no matter it was the one thing which he was resolved to do he had two selves within him apparently and they must learn to accommodate each other and bear reciprocal impediments strange that some of us with quick alternate vision see beyond our infatuations and even while we rave on the heights behold the wide plain where our persistent self pauses and awaits us to have approached laure with any suit that was not reverentially tender would have been simply a contradiction of his whole feeling towards her you have come all the way from paris to find me she said to him the next day sitting before him with folded arms and looking at him with eyes that seemed to wonder as an untamed ruminating animal wonders are all englishmen like that i came because i could not live without trying to see you you are lonely i love you i want you to consent to be my wife i will wait but i want you to promise that you will marry me no one else laure looked at him in silence with a melancholy radiance from under her grand eyelids until he was full of rapturous certainty and knelt close to her knees i will tell you something she said in her cooing way keeping her arms folded my foot really slipped i know i know said lydgate deprecatingly it was a fatal accident a dreadful stroke of calamity that bound me to you the more again laure paused a little and then said slowly i meant to do it lydgate strong man as he was turned pale and trembled moments seemed to pass before he rose and stood at a distance from her there was a secret then he said at last even vehemently he was brutal to you you hated him no he wearied me he was too fond he would live in paris and not in my country that was not agreeable to me great god said lydgate in a groan of horror and you planned to murder him i did not plan it came to me in the play i meant to do it lydgate stood mute and unconsciously pressed his hat on while he looked at her he saw this woman the first to whom he had given his young adoration amid the throng of stupid criminals you are a good young man she said but i do not like husbands i will never have another three days afterwards lydgate was at his galvanism again in his paris chambers believing that illusions were at an end for him he was saved from hardening effects by the abundant kindness of his heart and his belief that human life might be made better but he had more reason than ever for trusting his judgment now that it was so experienced and henceforth he would take a strictly scientific view of woman entertaining no expectations but such as were justified beforehand no one in middlemarch was likely to have such a notion of lydgate s past as has here been faintly shadowed and indeed the respectable townsfolk there were not more given than mortals generally to any eager attempt at exactness in the representation to themselves of what did not come under their own senses not only young virgins of that town but gray bearded men also were often in haste to conjecture how a new acquaintance might be wrought into their purposes contented with very vague knowledge as to the way in which life had been shaping him for that instrumentality middlemarch in fact counted on swallowing lydgate and assimilating him very comfortably the question whether mr tyke should be appointed as salaried chaplain to the hospital was an exciting topic to the middlemarchers and lydgate heard it discussed in a way that threw much light on the power exercised in the town by mr bulstrode the banker was evidently a ruler but there was an opposition party and even among his supporters there were some who allowed it to be seen that their support was a compromise and who frankly stated their impression that the general scheme of things and especially the casualties of trade required you to hold a candle to the devil mr bulstrode s power was not due simply to his being a country banker who knew the financial secrets of most traders in the town and could touch the springs of their credit it was fortified by a beneficence that was at once ready and severe ready to confer obligations and severe in watching the result he had gathered as an industrious man always at his post a chief share in administering the town charities and his private charities were both minute and abundant he would take a great deal of pains about apprenticing tegg the shoemaker s son and he would watch over tegg s church going he would defend mrs strype the washerwoman against stubbs s unjust exaction on the score of her drying ground and he would himself scrutinize a calumny against mrs strype his private minor loans were numerous but he would inquire strictly into the circumstances both before and after in this way a man gathers a domain in his neighbors hope and fear as well as gratitude and power when once it has got into that subtle region propagates itself spreading out of all proportion to its external means it was a principle with mr bulstrode to gain as much power as possible that he might use it for the glory of god he went through a great deal of spiritual conflict and inward argument in order to adjust his motives and make clear to himself what god s glory required but as we have seen his motives were not always rightly appreciated there were many crass minds in middlemarch whose reflective scales could only weigh things in the lump and they had a strong suspicion that since mr bulstrode could not enjoy life in their fashion eating and drinking so little as he did and worreting himself about everything he must have a sort of vampire s feast in the sense of mastery the subject of the chaplaincy came up at mr vincy s table when lydgate was dining there and the family connection with mr bulstrode did not he observed prevent some freedom of remark even on the part of the host himself though his reasons against the proposed arrangement turned entirely on his objection to mr tyke s sermons which were all doctrine and his preference for mr farebrother whose sermons were free from that taint mr vincy liked well enough the notion of the chaplain s having a salary supposing it were given to farebrother who was as good a little fellow as ever breathed and the best preacher anywhere and companionable too what line shall you take then said mr chichely the coroner a great coursing comrade of mr vincy s oh i m precious glad i m not one of the directors now i shall vote for referring the matter to the directors and the medical board together i shall roll some of my responsibility on your shoulders doctor said mr vincy glancing first at dr sprague the senior physician of the town and then at lydgate who sat opposite you medical gentlemen must consult which sort of black draught you will prescribe eh mr lydgate i know little of either said lydgate but in general appointments are apt to be made too much a question of personal liking the fittest man for a particular post is not always the best fellow or the most agreeable sometimes if you wanted to get a reform your only way would be to pension off the good fellows whom everybody is fond of and put them out of the question dr sprague who was considered the physician of most weight though dr minchin was usually said to have more penetration divested his large heavy face of all expression and looked at his wine glass while lydgate was speaking whatever was not problematical and suspected about this young man for
GE(Mddlem...),oh mr lydgate you know well what your advantages are you know that our young men here cannot cope with you where you frequent a house it may militate very much against a girl s making a desirable settlement in life and prevent her from accepting offers even if they are made lydgate was less flattered by his advantage over the middlemarch orlandos than he was annoyed by the perception of mrs bulstrode s meaning she felt that she had spoken as impressively as it was necessary to do and that in using the superior word militate she had thrown a noble drapery over a mass of particulars which were still evident enough lydgate was fuming a little pushed his hair back with one hand felt curiously in his waistcoat pocket with the other and then stooped to beckon the tiny black spaniel which had the insight to decline his hollow caresses it would not have been decent to go away because he had been dining with other guests and had just taken tea but mrs bulstrode having no doubt that she had been understood turned the conversation solomon s proverbs i think have omitted to say that as the sore palate findeth grit so an uneasy consciousness heareth innuendoes the next day mr farebrother parting from lydgate in the street supposed that they should meet at vincy s in the evening lydgate answered curtly no he had work to do he must give up going out in the evening what you are going to get lashed to the mast eh and are stopping your ears said the vicar well if you don t mean to be won by the sirens you are right to take precautions in time a few days before lydgate would have taken no notice of these words as anything more than the vicar s usual way of putting things they seemed now to convey an innuendo which confirmed the impression that he had been making a fool of himself and behaving so as to be misunderstood not he believed by rosamond herself she he felt sure took everything as lightly as he intended it she had an exquisite tact and insight in relation to all points of manners but the people she lived among were blunderers and busybodies however the mistake should go no farther he resolved and kept his resolution that he would not go to mr vincy s except on business rosamond became very unhappy the uneasiness first stirred by her aunt s questions grew and grew till at the end of ten days that she had not seen lydgate it grew into terror at the blank that might possibly come into foreboding of that ready fatal sponge which so cheaply wipes out the hopes of mortals the world would have a new dreariness for her as a wilderness that a magician s spells had turned for a little while into a garden she felt that she was beginning to know the pang of disappointed love and that no other man could be the occasion of such delightful aerial building as she had been enjoying for the last six months poor rosamond lost her appetite and felt as forlorn as ariadne as a charming stage ariadne left behind with all her boxes full of costumes and no hope of a coach there are many wonderful mixtures in the world which are all alike called love and claim the privileges of a sublime rage which is an apology for everything in literature and the drama happily rosamond did not think of committing any desperate act she plaited her fair hair as beautifully as usual and kept herself proudly calm her most cheerful supposition was that her aunt bulstrode had interfered in some way to hinder lydgate s visits everything was better than a spontaneous indifference in him any one who imagines ten days too short a time not for falling into leanness lightness or other measurable effects of passion but for the whole spiritual circuit of alarmed conjecture and disappointment is ignorant of what can go on in the elegant leisure of a young lady s mind on the eleventh day however lydgate when leaving stone court was requested by mrs vincy to let her husband know that there was a marked change in mr featherstone s health and that she wished him to come to stone court on that day now lydgate might have called at the warehouse or might have written a message on a leaf of his pocket book and left it at the door yet these simple devices apparently did not occur to him from which we may conclude that he had no strong objection to calling at the house at an hour when mr vincy was not at home and leaving the message with miss vincy a man may from various motives decline to give his company but perhaps not even a sage would be gratified that nobody missed him it would be a graceful easy way of piecing on the new habits to the old to have a few playful words with rosamond about his resistance to dissipation and his firm resolve to take long fasts even from sweet sounds it must be confessed also that momentary speculations as to all the possible grounds for mrs bulstrode s hints had managed to get woven like slight clinging hairs into the more substantial web of his thoughts miss vincy was alone and blushed so deeply when lydgate came in that he felt a corresponding embarrassment and instead of any playfulness he began at once to speak of his reason for calling and to beg her almost formally to deliver the message to her father rosamond who at the first moment felt as if her happiness were returning was keenly hurt by lydgate s manner her blush had departed and she assented coldly without adding an unnecessary word some trivial chain work which she had in her hands enabling her to avoid looking at lydgate higher than his chin in all failures the beginning is certainly the half of the whole after sitting two long moments while he moved his whip and could say nothing lydgate rose to go and rosamond made nervous by her struggle between mortification and the wish not to betray it dropped her chain as if startled and rose too mechanically lydgate instantaneously stooped to pick up the chain when he rose he was very near to a lovely little face set on a fair long neck which he had been used to see turning about under the most perfect management of self contented grace but as he raised his eyes now he saw a certain helpless quivering which touched him quite newly and made him look at rosamond with a questioning flash at this moment she was as natural as she had ever been when she was five years old she felt that her tears had risen and it was no use to try to do anything else than let them stay like water on a blue flower or let them fall over her cheeks even as they would that moment of naturalness was the crystallizing feather touch it shook flirtation into love remember that the ambitious man who was looking at those forget me nots under the water was very warm hearted and rash he did not know where the chain went an idea had thrilled through the recesses within him which had a miraculous effect in raising the power of passionate love lying buried there in no sealed sepulchre but under the lightest easily pierced mould his words were quite abrupt and awkward but the tone made them sound like an ardent appealing avowal what is the matter you are distressed tell me pray rosamond had never been spoken to in such tones before i am not sure that she knew what the words were but she looked at lydgate and the tears fell over her cheeks there could have been no more complete answer than that silence and lydgate forgetting everything else completely mastered by the outrush of tenderness at the sudden belief that this sweet young creature depended on him for her joy actually put his arms round her folding her gently and protectingly he was used to being gentle with the weak and suffering and kissed each of the two large tears this was a strange way of arriving at an understanding but it was a short way rosamond was not angry but she moved backward a little in timid happiness and lydgate could now sit near her and speak less incompletely rosamond had to make her little confession and he poured out words of gratitude and tenderness with impulsive lavishment in half an hour he left the house an engaged man whose soul was not his own but the woman s to whom he had bound himself he came again in the evening to speak with mr vincy who just returned from stone court was feeling sure that it would not be long before he heard of mr featherstone s demise the felicitous word demise which had seasonably occurred to him had raised his spirits even above their usual evening pitch the right word is always a power and communicates its definiteness to our action considered as a demise old featherstone s death assumed a merely legal aspect so that mr vincy could tap his snuff box over it and be jovial without even an intermittent affectation of solemnity and mr vincy hated both solemnity and affectation who was ever awe struck about a testator or sang a hymn on the title to real property mr vincy was inclined to take a jovial view of all things that evening he even observed to lydgate that fred had got the family constitution after all and would soon be as fine a fellow as ever again and when his approbation of rosamond s engagement was asked for he gave it with astonishing facility passing at once to general remarks on the desirableness of matrimony for young men and maidens and apparently deducing from the whole the appropriateness of a little more punch the triumphant confidence of the mayor founded on mr featherstone s insistent demand that fred and his mother should not leave him was a feeble emotion compared with all that was agitating the breasts of the old man s blood relations who naturally manifested more their sense of the family tie and were more visibly numerous now that he had become bedridden naturally for when poor peter had occupied his arm chair in the wainscoted parlor no assiduous beetles for whom the cook prepares boiling water could have been less welcome on a hearth which they had reasons for preferring than those persons whose featherstone blood was ill nourished not from penuriousness on their part but from poverty brother solomon and sister jane were rich and the family candor and total abstinence from false politeness with which they were always received seemed to them no argument that their brother in the solemn act of making his will would overlook the superior claims of wealth themselves at least he had never been unnatural enough to banish from his house and it seemed hardly eccentric that he should have kept away brother jonah sister martha and the rest who had no shadow of such claims they knew peter s maxim that money was a good egg and should be laid in a warm nest but brother jonah sister martha and all the needy exiles held a different point of view probabilities are as various as the faces to be seen at will in fretwork or paper hangings every form is there from jupiter to judy if you only look with creative inclination to the poorer and least favored it seemed likely that since peter had done nothing for them in his life he would remember them at the last jonah argued that men liked to make a surprise of their wills while martha said that nobody need be surprised if he left the best part of his money to those who least expected it also it was not to be thought but that an own brother lying there with dropsy in his legs must come to feel that blood was thicker than water and if he didn t alter his will he might have money by him at any rate some blood relations should be on the premises and on the watch against those who were hardly relations at all such things had been known as forged wills and disputed wills which seemed to have the golden hazy advantage of somehow enabling non legatees to live out of them again those who were no blood relations might be caught making away with things and poor peter lying there helpless somebody should be on the watch but in this conclusion they were at one with solomon and jane also some nephews nieces and cousins arguing with still greater subtilty as to what might be done by a man able to will away his property and give himself large treats of oddity felt in a handsome sort of way that there was a family interest to be attended to and thought of stone court as a place which it would be nothing but right for them to visit sister martha otherwise mrs cranch living with some wheeziness in the chalky flats could not undertake the journey but her son as being poor peter s own nephew could represent her advantageously and watch lest his uncle jonah should make an unfair use of the improbable things which seemed likely to happen in fact there was a general sense running in the featherstone blood that everybody must watch everybody else and that it would be well for everybody else to reflect that the almighty was watching him thus stone court continually saw one or other blood relation alighting or departing and mary garth had the unpleasant task of carrying their messages to mr featherstone who would see none of them and sent her down with the still more unpleasant task of telling them so as manager of the household she felt bound to ask them in good provincial fashion to stay and eat but she chose to consult mrs vincy on the point of extra down stairs consumption now that mr featherstone was laid up oh my dear you must do things handsomely where there s last illness and a property god knows i don t grudge them every ham in the house only save the best for the funeral have some stuffed veal always and a fine cheese in cut you must expect to keep open house in these last illnesses said liberal mrs vincy once more of cheerful note and bright plumage but some of the visitors alighted and did not depart after the handsome treating to veal and ham brother jonah for example there are such unpleasant people in most families perhaps even in the highest aristocracy there are brobdingnag specimens gigantically in debt and bloated at greater expense brother jonah i say having come down in the world was mainly supported by a calling which he was modest enough not to boast of though it was much better than swindling either on exchange or turf but which did not require his presence at brassing so long as he had a good corner to sit in and a supply of food he chose the kitchen corner partly because he liked it best and partly because he did not want to sit with solomon concerning whom he had a strong brotherly opinion seated in a famous arm chair and in his best suit constantly within sight of good cheer he had a comfortable consciousness of being on the premises mingled with fleeting suggestions of sunday and the bar at the green man and he informed mary garth that he should not go out of reach of his brother peter while that poor fellow was above ground the troublesome ones in a family are usually either the wits or the idiots jonah was the wit among the featherstones and joked with the maid servants when they came about the hearth but seemed to consider miss garth a suspicious character and followed her with cold eyes mary would have borne this one pair of eyes with comparative ease but unfortunately there was young cranch who having come all the way from the chalky flats to represent his mother and watch his uncle jonah also felt it his duty to stay and to sit chiefly in the kitchen to give his uncle company young cranch was not exactly the balancing point between the wit and the idiot verging slightly towards the latter type and squinting so as to leave everything in doubt about his sentiments except that they were not of a forcible character when mary garth entered the kitchen and mr jonah featherstone began to follow her with his cold detective eyes young cranch turning his head in the same direction seemed to insist on it that she should remark how he was squinting as if he did it with design like the gypsies when borrow read the new testament to them this was rather too much for poor mary sometimes it made her bilious sometimes it upset her gravity one day that she had an opportunity she could not resist describing the kitchen scene to fred who would not be hindered from immediately going to see it affecting simply to pass through but no sooner did he face the four eyes than he had to rush through the nearest door which happened to lead to the dairy and there under the high roof and among the pans he gave way to laughter which made a hollow resonance perfectly audible in the kitchen he fled by another doorway but mr jonah who had not before seen fred s white complexion long legs and pinched delicacy of face prepared many sarcasms in which these points of appearance were wittily combined with the lowest moral attributes why tom you don t wear such gentlemanly trousers you haven t got half such fine long legs said jonah to his nephew winking at the same time to imply that there was something more in these statements than their undeniableness tom looked at his legs but left it uncertain whether he preferred his moral advantages to a more vicious length of limb and reprehensible gentility of trouser in the large wainscoted parlor too there were constantly pairs of eyes on the watch and own relatives eager to be sitters up many came lunched and departed but brother solomon and the lady who had been jane featherstone for twenty five years before she was mrs waule found it good to be there every day for hours without other calculable occupation than that of observing the cunning mary garth who was so deep that she could be found out in nothing and giving occasional dry wrinkly indications of crying as if capable of torrents in a wetter season at the thought that they were not allowed to go into mr featherstone s room for the old man s dislike of his own family seemed to get stronger as he got less able to amuse himself by saying biting things to them too languid to sting he had the more venom refluent in his blood not fully believing the message sent through mary garth they had presented themselves together within the door of the bedroom both in black mrs waule having a white handkerchief partially unfolded in her hand and both with faces in a sort of half mourning purple while mrs vincy with her pink cheeks and pink ribbons flying was actually administering a cordial to their own brother and the light complexioned fred his short hair curling as might be expected in a gambler s was lolling at his ease in a large chair old featherstone no sooner caught sight of these funereal figures appearing in spite of his orders than rage came to strengthen him more successfully than the cordial he was propped up on a bed rest and always had his gold headed stick lying by him he seized it now and swept it backwards and forwards in as large an area as he could apparently to ban these ugly spectres crying in a hoarse sort of screech back back mrs waule back solomon oh brother peter mrs waule began but solomon put his hand before her repressingly he was a large cheeked man nearly seventy with small furtive eyes and was not only of much blander temper but thought himself much deeper than his brother peter indeed not likely to be deceived in any of his fellow men inasmuch as they could not well be more greedy and deceitful than he suspected them of being even the invisible powers he thought were likely to be soothed by a bland parenthesis here and there coming from a man of property who might have been as impious as others brother peter he said in a wheedling yet gravely official tone it s nothing but right i should speak to you about the three crofts and the manganese the almighty knows what i ve got on my mind then he knows more than i want to know said peter laying down his stick with a show of truce which had a threat in it too for he reversed the stick so as to make the gold handle a club in case of closer fighting and looked hard at solomon s bald head there s things you might repent of brother for want of speaking to me said solomon not advancing however i could sit up with you to night and jane with me willingly and you might take your own time to speak or let me speak yes i shall take my own time you needn t offer me yours said peter but you can t take your own time to die in brother began mrs waule with her usual woolly tone and when you lie speechless you may be tired of having strangers about you and you may think of me and my children but here her voice broke under the touching thought which she was attributing to her speechless brother the mention of ourselves being naturally affecting no i shan t said old featherstone contradictiously i shan t think of any of you i ve made my will i tell you i ve made my will here he turned his head towards mrs vincy and swallowed some more of his cordial some people would be ashamed to fill up a place belonging by rights to others said mrs waule turning her narrow eyes in the same direction oh sister said solomon with ironical softness you and me are not fine and handsome and clever enough we must be humble and let smart people push themselves before us fred s spirit could not bear this rising and looking at mr featherstone he said shall my mother and i leave the room sir that you may be alone with your friends sit down i tell you said old featherstone snappishly stop where you are good by solomon he added trying to wield his stick again but failing now that he had reversed the handle good by mrs waule don t you come again i shall be down stairs brother whether or no said solomon i shall do my duty and it remains to be seen what the almighty will allow yes in property going out of families said mrs waule in continuation and where there s steady young men to carry on but i pity them who are not such and i pity their mothers good by brother peter remember i m the eldest after you brother and prospered from the
GE(Mddlem...),and liked to give others their due feeling that he could afford it he had caught the words expectant method and rang chimes on this and other learned phrases to accompany the assurance that lydgate knew a thing or two more than the rest of the doctors was far better versed in the secrets of his profession than the majority of his compeers this had happened before the affair of fred vincy s illness had given to mr wrench s enmity towards lydgate more definite personal ground the new comer already threatened to be a nuisance in the shape of rivalry and was certainly a nuisance in the shape of practical criticism or reflections on his hard driven elders who had had something else to do than to busy themselves with untried notions his practice had spread in one or two quarters and from the first the report of his high family had led to his being pretty generally invited so that the other medical men had to meet him at dinner in the best houses and having to meet a man whom you dislike is not observed always to end in a mutual attachment there was hardly ever so much unanimity among them as in the opinion that lydgate was an arrogant young fellow and yet ready for the sake of ultimately predominating to show a crawling subservience to bulstrode that mr farebrother whose name was a chief flag of the anti bulstrode party always defended lydgate and made a friend of him was referred to farebrother s unaccountable way of fighting on both sides here was plenty of preparation for the outburst of professional disgust at the announcement of the laws mr bulstrode was laying down for the direction of the new hospital which were the more exasperating because there was no present possibility of interfering with his will and pleasure everybody except lord medlicote having refused help towards the building on the ground that they preferred giving to the old infirmary mr bulstrode met all the expenses and had ceased to be sorry that he was purchasing the right to carry out his notions of improvement without hindrance from prejudiced coadjutors but he had had to spend large sums and the building had lingered caleb garth had undertaken it had failed during its progress and before the interior fittings were begun had retired from the management of the business and when referring to the hospital he often said that however bulstrode might ring if you tried him he liked good solid carpentry and masonry and had a notion both of drains and chimneys in fact the hospital had become an object of intense interest to bulstrode and he would willingly have continued to spare a large yearly sum that he might rule it dictatorially without any board but he had another favorite object which also required money for its accomplishment he wished to buy some land in the neighborhood of middlemarch and therefore he wished to get considerable contributions towards maintaining the hospital meanwhile he framed his plan of management the hospital was to be reserved for fever in all its forms lydgate was to be chief medical superintendent that he might have free authority to pursue all comparative investigations which his studies particularly in paris had shown him the importance of the other medical visitors having a consultative influence but no power to contravene lydgate s ultimate decisions and the general management was to be lodged exclusively in the hands of five directors associated with mr bulstrode who were to have votes in the ratio of their contributions the board itself filling up any vacancy in its numbers and no mob of small contributors being admitted to a share of government there was an immediate refusal on the part of every medical man in the town to become a visitor at the fever hospital very well said lydgate to mr bulstrode we have a capital house surgeon and dispenser a clear headed neat handed fellow we ll get webbe from crabsley as good a country practitioner as any of them to come over twice a week and in case of any exceptional operation protheroe will come from brassing i must work the harder that s all and i have given up my post at the infirmary the plan will flourish in spite of them and then they ll be glad to come in things can t last as they are there must be all sorts of reform soon and then young fellows may be glad to come and study here lydgate was in high spirits i shall not flinch you may depend upon it mr lydgate said mr bulstrode while i see you carrying out high intentions with vigor you shall have my unfailing support and i have humble confidence that the blessing which has hitherto attended my efforts against the spirit of evil in this town will not be withdrawn suitable directors to assist me i have no doubt of securing mr brooke of tipton has already given me his concurrence and a pledge to contribute yearly he has not specified the sum probably not a great one but he will be a useful member of the board a useful member was perhaps to be defined as one who would originate nothing and always vote with mr bulstrode the medical aversion to lydgate was hardly disguised now neither dr sprague nor dr minchin said that he disliked lydgate s knowledge or his disposition to improve treatment what they disliked was his arrogance which nobody felt to be altogether deniable they implied that he was insolent pretentious and given to that reckless innovation for the sake of noise and show which was the essence of the charlatan the word charlatan once thrown on the air could not be let drop in those days the world was agitated about the wondrous doings of mr st john long noblemen and gentlemen attesting his extraction of a fluid like mercury from the temples of a patient mr toller remarked one day smilingly to mrs taft that bulstrode had found a man to suit him in lydgate a charlatan in religion is sure to like other sorts of charlatans yes indeed i can imagine said mrs taft keeping the number of thirty stitches carefully in her mind all the while there are so many of that sort i remember mr cheshire with his irons trying to make people straight when the almighty had made them crooked no no said mr toller cheshire was all right all fair and above board but there s st john long that s the kind of fellow we call a charlatan advertising cures in ways nobody knows anything about a fellow who wants to make a noise by pretending to go deeper than other people the other day he was pretending to tap a man s brain and get quicksilver out of it good gracious what dreadful trifling with people s constitutions said mrs taft after this it came to be held in various quarters that lydgate played even with respectable constitutions for his own purposes and how much more likely that in his flighty experimenting he should make sixes and sevens of hospital patients especially it was to be expected as the landlady of the tankard had said that he would recklessly cut up their dead bodies for lydgate having attended mrs goby who died apparently of a heart disease not very clearly expressed in the symptoms too daringly asked leave of her relatives to open the body and thus gave an offence quickly spreading beyond parley street where that lady had long resided on an income such as made this association of her body with the victims of burke and hare a flagrant insult to her memory affairs were in this stage when lydgate opened the subject of the hospital to dorothea we see that he was bearing enmity and silly misconception with much spirit aware that they were partly created by his good share of success they will not drive me away he said talking confidentially in mr farebrother s study i have got a good opportunity here for the ends i care most about and i am pretty sure to get income enough for our wants by and by i shall go on as quietly as possible i have no seductions now away from home and work and i am more and more convinced that it will be possible to demonstrate the homogeneous origin of all the tissues raspail and others are on the same track and i have been losing time i have no power of prophecy there said mr farebrother who had been puffing at his pipe thoughtfully while lydgate talked but as to the hostility in the town you ll weather it if you are prudent how am i to be prudent said lydgate i just do what comes before me to do i can t help people s ignorance and spite any more than vesalius could it isn t possible to square one s conduct to silly conclusions which nobody can foresee quite true i didn t mean that i meant only two things one is keep yourself as separable from bulstrode as you can of course you can go on doing good work of your own by his help but don t get tied perhaps it seems like personal feeling in me to say so and there s a good deal of that i own but personal feeling is not always in the wrong if you boil it down to the impressions which make it simply an opinion bulstrode is nothing to me said lydgate carelessly except on public grounds as to getting very closely united to him i am not fond enough of him for that but what was the other thing you meant said lydgate who was nursing his leg as comfortably as possible and feeling in no great need of advice why this take care experto crede take care not to get hampered about money matters i know by a word you let fall one day that you don t like my playing at cards so much for money you are right enough there but try and keep clear of wanting small sums that you haven t got i am perhaps talking rather superfluously but a man likes to assume superiority over himself by holding up his bad example and sermonizing on it lydgate took mr farebrother s hints very cordially though he would hardly have borne them from another man he could not help remembering that he had lately made some debts but these had seemed inevitable and he had no intention now to do more than keep house in a simple way the furniture for which he owed would not want renewing nor even the stock of wine for a long while many thoughts cheered him at that time and justly a man conscious of enthusiasm for worthy aims is sustained under petty hostilities by the memory of great workers who had to fight their way not without wounds and who hover in his mind as patron saints invisibly helping at home that same evening when he had been chatting with mr farebrother he had his long legs stretched on the sofa his head thrown back and his hands clasped behind it according to his favorite ruminating attitude while rosamond sat at the piano and played one tune after another of which her husband only knew like the emotional elephant he was that they fell in with his mood as if they had been melodious sea breezes there was something very fine in lydgate s look just then and any one might have been encouraged to bet on his achievement in his dark eyes and on his mouth and brow there was that placidity which comes from the fulness of contemplative thought the mind not searching but beholding and the glance seeming to be filled with what is behind it presently rosamond left the piano and seated herself on a chair close to the sofa and opposite her husband s face is that enough music for you my lord she said folding her hands before her and putting on a little air of meekness yes dear if you are tired said lydgate gently turning his eyes and resting them on her but not otherwise moving rosamond s presence at that moment was perhaps no more than a spoonful brought to the lake and her woman s instinct in this matter was not dull what is absorbing you she said leaning forward and bringing her face nearer to his he moved his hands and placed them gently behind her shoulders i am thinking of a great fellow who was about as old as i am three hundred years ago and had already begun a new era in anatomy i can t guess said rosamond shaking her head we used to play at guessing historical characters at mrs lemon s but not anatomists i ll tell you his name was vesalius and the only way he could get to know anatomy as he did was by going to snatch bodies at night from graveyards and places of execution oh said rosamond with a look of disgust on her pretty face i am very glad you are not vesalius i should have thought he might find some less horrible way than that no he couldn t said lydgate going on too earnestly to take much notice of her answer he could only get a complete skeleton by snatching the whitened bones of a criminal from the gallows and burying them and fetching them away by bits secretly in the dead of night i hope he is not one of your great heroes said rosamond half playfully half anxiously else i shall have you getting up in the night to go to st peter s churchyard you know how angry you told me the people were about mrs goby you have enemies enough already so had vesalius rosy no wonder the medical fogies in middlemarch are jealous when some of the greatest doctors living were fierce upon vesalius because they had believed in galen and he showed that galen was wrong they called him a liar and a poisonous monster but the facts of the human frame were on his side and so he got the better of them and what happened to him afterwards said rosamond with some interest oh he had a good deal of fighting to the last and they did exasperate him enough at one time to make him burn a good deal of his work then he got shipwrecked just as he was coming from jerusalem to take a great chair at padua he died rather miserably there was a moment s pause before rosamond said do you know tertius i often wish you had not been a medical man nay rosy don t say that said lydgate drawing her closer to him that is like saying you wish you had married another man not at all you are clever enough for anything you might easily have been something else and your cousins at quallingham all think that you have sunk below them in your choice of a profession the cousins at quallingham may go to the devil said lydgate with scorn it was like their impudence if they said anything of the sort to you still said rosamond i do not think it is a nice profession dear we know that she had much quiet perseverance in her opinion it is the grandest profession in the world rosamond said lydgate gravely and to say that you love me without loving the medical man in me is the same sort of thing as to say that you like eating a peach but don t like its flavor don t say that again dear it pains me very well doctor grave face said rosy dimpling i will declare in future that i dote on skeletons and body snatchers and bits of things in phials and quarrels with everybody that end in your dying miserably no no not so bad as that said lydgate giving up remonstrance and petting her resignedly while lydgate safely married and with the hospital under his command felt himself struggling for medical reform against middlemarch middlemarch was becoming more and more conscious of the national struggle for another kind of reform by the time that lord john russell s measure was being debated in the house of commons there was a new political animation in middlemarch and a new definition of parties which might show a decided change of balance if a new election came and there were some who already predicted this event declaring that a reform bill would never be carried by the actual parliament this was what will ladislaw dwelt on to mr brooke as a reason for congratulation that he had not yet tried his strength at the hustings things will grow and ripen as if it were a comet year said will the public temper will soon get to a cometary heat now the question of reform has set in there is likely to be another election before long and by that time middlemarch will have got more ideas into its head what we have to work at now is the pioneer and political meetings quite right ladislaw we shall make a new thing of opinion here said mr brooke only i want to keep myself independent about reform you know i don t want to go too far i want to take up wilberforce s and romilly s line you know and work at negro emancipation criminal law that kind of thing but of course i should support grey if you go in for the principle of reform you must be prepared to take what the situation offers said will if everybody pulled for his own bit against everybody else the whole question would go to tatters yes yes i agree with you i quite take that point of view i should put it in that light i should support grey you know but i don t want to change the balance of the constitution and i don t think grey would but that is what the country wants said will else there would be no meaning in political unions or any other movement that knows what it s about it wants to have a house of commons which is not weighted with nominees of the landed class but with representatives of the other interests and as to contending for a reform short of that it is like asking for a bit of an avalanche which has already begun to thunder that is fine ladislaw that is the way to put it write that down now we must begin to get documents about the feeling of the country as well as the machine breaking and general distress as to documents said will a two inch card will hold plenty a few rows of figures are enough to deduce misery from and a few more will show the rate at which the political determination of the people is growing good draw that out a little more at length ladislaw that is an idea now write it out in the pioneer put the figures and deduce the misery you know and put the other figures and deduce and so on you have a way of putting things burke now when i think of burke i can t help wishing somebody had a pocket borough to give you ladislaw you d never get elected you know and we shall always want talent in the house reform as we will we shall always want talent that avalanche and the thunder now was really a little like burke i want that sort of thing not ideas you know but a way of putting them pocket boroughs would be a fine thing said ladislaw if they were always in the right pocket and there were always a burke at hand will was not displeased with that complimentary comparison even from mr brooke for it is a little too trying to human flesh to be conscious of expressing one s self better than others and never to have it noticed and in the general dearth of admiration for the right thing even a chance bray of applause falling exactly in time is rather fortifying will felt that his literary refinements were usually beyond the limits of middlemarch perception nevertheless he was beginning thoroughly to like the work of which when he began he had said to himself rather languidly why not and he studied the political situation with as ardent an interest as he had ever given to poetic metres or mediaevalism it is undeniable that but for the desire to be where dorothea was and perhaps the want of knowing what else to do will would not at this time have been meditating on the needs of the english people or criticising english statesmanship he would probably have been rambling in italy sketching plans for several dramas trying prose and finding it too jejune trying verse and finding it too artificial beginning to copy bits from old pictures leaving off because they were no good and observing that after all self culture was the principal point while in politics he would have been sympathizing warmly with liberty and progress in general our sense of duty must often wait for some work which shall take the place of dilettanteism and make us feel that the quality of our action is not a matter of indifference ladislaw had now accepted his bit of work though it was not that indeterminate loftiest thing which he had once dreamed of as alone worthy of continuous effort his nature warmed easily in the presence of subjects which were visibly mixed with life and action and the easily stirred rebellion in him helped the glow of public spirit in spite of mr casaubon and the banishment from lowick he was rather happy getting a great deal of fresh knowledge in a vivid way and for practical purposes and making the pioneer celebrated as far as brassing never mind the smallness of the area the writing was not worse than much that reaches the four corners of the earth mr brooke was occasionally irritating but will s impatience was relieved by the division of his time between visits to the grange and retreats to his middlemarch lodgings which gave variety to his life shift the pegs a little he said to himself and mr brooke might be in the cabinet while i was under secretary that is the common order of things the little waves make the large ones and are of the same pattern i am better here than in the sort of life mr casaubon would have trained me for where the doing would be all laid down by a precedent too rigid for me to react upon i don t care for prestige or high pay as lydgate had said of him he was a sort of gypsy rather enjoying the sense of belonging to no class he had a feeling of romance in his position and a pleasant consciousness of creating a little surprise wherever he went that sort of enjoyment had been disturbed when he had felt some new distance between himself and dorothea in their accidental meeting at lydgate s and his irritation had gone out towards mr casaubon who had declared beforehand that will would lose caste i never had any caste he would have said if that prophecy had been uttered to him and the quick blood would have come and gone like breath in his transparent skin but it is one thing to like defiance and another thing to like its consequences meanwhile the town
GE(Mddlem...),with those words uttered impetuously will rose put out his hand to rosamond still with the air of a somnambulist and went away when he was gone rosamond left her chair and walked to the other end of the room leaning when she got there against a chiffonniere and looking out of the window wearily she was oppressed by ennui and by that dissatisfaction which in women s minds is continually turning into a trivial jealousy referring to no real claims springing from no deeper passion than the vague exactingness of egoism and yet capable of impelling action as well as speech there really is nothing to care for much said poor rosamond inwardly thinking of the family at quallingham who did not write to her and that perhaps tertius when he came home would tease her about expenses she had already secretly disobeyed him by asking her father to help them and he had ended decisively by saying i am more likely to want help myself a few days afterwards it was already the end of august there was an occasion which caused some excitement in middlemarch the public if it chose was to have the advantage of buying under the distinguished auspices of mr borthrop trumbull the furniture books and pictures which anybody might see by the handbills to be the best in every kind belonging to edwin larcher esq this was not one of the sales indicating the depression of trade on the contrary it was due to mr larcher s great success in the carrying business which warranted his purchase of a mansion near riverston already furnished in high style by an illustrious spa physician furnished indeed with such large framefuls of expensive flesh painting in the dining room that mrs larcher was nervous until reassured by finding the subjects to be scriptural hence the fine opportunity to purchasers which was well pointed out in the handbills of mr borthrop trumbull whose acquaintance with the history of art enabled him to state that the hall furniture to be sold without reserve comprised a piece of carving by a contemporary of gibbons at middlemarch in those times a large sale was regarded as a kind of festival there was a table spread with the best cold eatables as at a superior funeral and facilities were offered for that generous drinking of cheerful glasses which might lead to generous and cheerful bidding for undesirable articles mr larcher s sale was the more attractive in the fine weather because the house stood just at the end of the town with a garden and stables attached in that pleasant issue from middlemarch called the london road which was also the road to the new hospital and to mr bulstrode s retired residence known as the shrubs in short the auction was as good as a fair and drew all classes with leisure at command to some who risked making bids in order simply to raise prices it was almost equal to betting at the races the second day when the best furniture was to be sold everybody was there even mr thesiger the rector of st peter s had looked in for a short time wishing to buy the carved table and had rubbed elbows with mr bambridge and mr horrock there was a wreath of middlemarch ladies accommodated with seats round the large table in the dining room where mr borthrop trumbull was mounted with desk and hammer but the rows chiefly of masculine faces behind were often varied by incomings and outgoings both from the door and the large bow window opening on to the lawn everybody that day did not include mr bulstrode whose health could not well endure crowds and draughts but mrs bulstrode had particularly wished to have a certain picture a supper at emmaus attributed in the catalogue to guido and at the last moment before the day of the sale mr bulstrode had called at the office of the pioneer of which he was now one of the proprietors to beg of mr ladislaw as a great favor that he would obligingly use his remarkable knowledge of pictures on behalf of mrs bulstrode and judge of the value of this particular painting if added the scrupulously polite banker attendance at the sale would not interfere with the arrangements for your departure which i know is imminent this proviso might have sounded rather satirically in will s ear if he had been in a mood to care about such satire it referred to an understanding entered into many weeks before with the proprietors of the paper that he should be at liberty any day he pleased to hand over the management to the subeditor whom he had been training since he wished finally to quit middlemarch but indefinite visions of ambition are weak against the ease of doing what is habitual or beguilingly agreeable and we all know the difficulty of carrying out a resolve when we secretly long that it may turn out to be unnecessary in such states of mind the most incredulous person has a private leaning towards miracle impossible to conceive how our wish could be fulfilled still very wonderful things have happened will did not confess this weakness to himself but he lingered what was the use of going to london at that time of the year the rugby men who would remember him were not there and so far as political writing was concerned he would rather for a few weeks go on with the pioneer at the present moment however when mr bulstrode was speaking to him he had both a strengthened resolve to go and an equally strong resolve not to go till he had once more seen dorothea hence he replied that he had reasons for deferring his departure a little and would be happy to go to the sale will was in a defiant mood his consciousness being deeply stung with the thought that the people who looked at him probably knew a fact tantamount to an accusation against him as a fellow with low designs which were to be frustrated by a disposal of property like most people who assert their freedom with regard to conventional distinction he was prepared to be sudden and quick at quarrel with any one who might hint that he had personal reasons for that assertion that there was anything in his blood his bearing or his character to which he gave the mask of an opinion when he was under an irritating impression of this kind he would go about for days with a defiant look the color changing in his transparent skin as if he were on the qui vive watching for something which he had to dart upon this expression was peculiarly noticeable in him at the sale and those who had only seen him in his moods of gentle oddity or of bright enjoyment would have been struck with a contrast he was not sorry to have this occasion for appearing in public before the middlemarch tribes of toller hackbutt and the rest who looked down on him as an adventurer and were in a state of brutal ignorance about dante who sneered at his polish blood and were themselves of a breed very much in need of crossing he stood in a conspicuous place not far from the auctioneer with a fore finger in each side pocket and his head thrown backward not caring to speak to anybody though he had been cordially welcomed as a connoiss ure by mr trumbull who was enjoying the utmost activity of his great faculties and surely among all men whose vocation requires them to exhibit their powers of speech the happiest is a prosperous provincial auctioneer keenly alive to his own jokes and sensible of his encyclopedic knowledge some saturnine sour blooded persons might object to be constantly insisting on the merits of all articles from boot jacks to berghems but mr borthrop trumbull had a kindly liquid in his veins he was an admirer by nature and would have liked to have the universe under his hammer feeling that it would go at a higher figure for his recommendation meanwhile mrs larcher s drawing room furniture was enough for him when will ladislaw had come in a second fender said to have been forgotten in its right place suddenly claimed the auctioneer s enthusiasm which he distributed on the equitable principle of praising those things most which were most in need of praise the fender was of polished steel with much lancet shaped open work and a sharp edge now ladies said he i shall appeal to you here is a fender which at any other sale would hardly be offered with out reserve being as i may say for quality of steel and quaintness of design a kind of thing here mr trumbull dropped his voice and became slightly nasal trimming his outlines with his left finger that might not fall in with ordinary tastes allow me to tell you that by and by this style of workmanship will be the only one in vogue half a crown you said thank you going at half a crown this characteristic fender and i have particular information that the antique style is very much sought after in high quarters three shillings three and sixpence hold it well up joseph look ladies at the chastity of the design i have no doubt myself that it was turned out in the last century four shillings mr mawmsey four shillings it s not a thing i would put in my drawing room said mrs mawmsey audibly for the warning of the rash husband i wonder at mrs larcher every blessed child s head that fell against it would be cut in two the edge is like a knife quite true rejoined mr trumbull quickly and most uncommonly useful to have a fender at hand that will cut if you have a leather shoe tie or a bit of string that wants cutting and no knife at hand many a man has been left hanging because there was no knife to cut him down gentlemen here s a fender that if you had the misfortune to hang yourselves would cut you down in no time with astonishing celerity four and sixpence five five and sixpence an appropriate thing for a spare bedroom where there was a four poster and a guest a little out of his mind six shillings thank you mr clintup going at six shillings going gone the auctioneer s glance which had been searching round him with a preternatural susceptibility to all signs of bidding here dropped on the paper before him and his voice too dropped into a tone of indifferent despatch as he said mr clintup be handy joseph it was worth six shillings to have a fender you could always tell that joke on said mr clintup laughing low and apologetically to his next neighbor he was a diffident though distinguished nurseryman and feared that the audience might regard his bid as a foolish one meanwhile joseph had brought a trayful of small articles now ladies said mr trumbull taking up one of the articles this tray contains a very recherchy lot a collection of trifles for the drawing room table and trifles make the sum of human things nothing more important than trifles yes mr ladislaw yes by and by but pass the tray round joseph these bijoux must be examined ladies this i have in my hand is an ingenious contrivance a sort of practical rebus i may call it here you see it looks like an elegant heart shaped box portable for the pocket there again it becomes like a splendid double flower an ornament for the table and now mr trumbull allowed the flower to fall alarmingly into strings of heart shaped leaves a book of riddles no less than five hundred printed in a beautiful red gentlemen if i had less of a conscience i should not wish you to bid high for this lot i have a longing for it myself what can promote innocent mirth and i may say virtue more than a good riddle it hinders profane language and attaches a man to the society of refined females this ingenious article itself without the elegant domino box card basket c ought alone to give a high price to the lot carried in the pocket it might make an individual welcome in any society four shillings sir four shillings for this remarkable collection of riddles with the et caeteras here is a sample how must you spell honey to make it catch lady birds answer money you hear lady birds honey money this is an amusement to sharpen the intellect it has a sting it has what we call satire and wit without indecency four and sixpence five shillings the bidding ran on with warming rivalry mr bowyer was a bidder and this was too exasperating bowyer couldn t afford it and only wanted to hinder every other man from making a figure the current carried even mr horrock with it but this committal of himself to an opinion fell from him with so little sacrifice of his neutral expression that the bid might not have been detected as his but for the friendly oaths of mr bambridge who wanted to know what horrock would do with blasted stuff only fit for haberdashers given over to that state of perdition which the horse dealer so cordially recognized in the majority of earthly existences the lot was finally knocked down at a guinea to mr spilkins a young slender of the neighborhood who was reckless with his pocket money and felt his want of memory for riddles come trumbull this is too bad you ve been putting some old maid s rubbish into the sale murmured mr toller getting close to the auctioneer i want to see how the prints go and i must be off soon im mediately mr toller it was only an act of benevolence which your noble heart would approve joseph quick with the prints lot 235 now gentlemen you who are connoiss ures you are going to have a treat here is an engraving of the duke of wellington surrounded by his staff on the field of waterloo and notwithstanding recent events which have as it were enveloped our great hero in a cloud i will be bold to say for a man in my line must not be blown about by political winds that a finer subject of the modern order belonging to our own time and epoch the understanding of man could hardly conceive angels might perhaps but not men sirs not men who painted it said mr powderell much impressed it is a proof before the letter mr powderell the painter is not known answered trumbull with a certain gaspingness in his last words after which he pursed up his lips and stared round him i ll bid a pound said mr powderell in a tone of resolved emotion as of a man ready to put himself in the breach whether from awe or pity nobody raised the price on him next came two dutch prints which mr toller had been eager for and after he had secured them he went away other prints and afterwards some paintings were sold to leading middlemarchers who had come with a special desire for them and there was a more active movement of the audience in and out some who had bought what they wanted going away others coming in either quite newly or from a temporary visit to the refreshments which were spread under the marquee on the lawn it was this marquee that mr bambridge was bent on buying and he appeared to like looking inside it frequently as a foretaste of its possession on the last occasion of his return from it he was observed to bring with him a new companion a stranger to mr trumbull and every one else whose appearance however led to the supposition that he might be a relative of the horse dealer s also given to indulgence his large whiskers imposing swagger and swing of the leg made him a striking figure but his suit of black rather shabby at the edges caused the prejudicial inference that he was not able to afford himself as much indulgence as he liked who is it you ve picked up bam said mr horrock aside ask him yourself returned mr bambridge he said he d just turned in from the road mr horrock eyed the stranger who was leaning back against his stick with one hand using his toothpick with the other and looking about him with a certain restlessness apparently under the silence imposed on him by circumstances at length the supper at emmaus was brought forward to will s immense relief for he was getting so tired of the proceedings that he had drawn back a little and leaned his shoulder against the wall just behind the auctioneer he now came forward again and his eye caught the conspicuous stranger who rather to his surprise was staring at him markedly but will was immediately appealed to by mr trumbull yes mr ladislaw yes this interests you as a connoiss ure i think it is some pleasure the auctioneer went on with a rising fervor to have a picture like this to show to a company of ladies and gentlemen a picture worth any sum to an individual whose means were on a level with his judgment it is a painting of the italian school by the celebrated guydo the greatest painter in the world the chief of the old masters as they are called i take it because they were up to a thing or two beyond most of us in possession of secrets now lost to the bulk of mankind let me tell you gentlemen i have seen a great many pictures by the old masters and they are not all up to this mark some of them are darker than you might like and not family subjects but here is a guydo the frame alone is worth pounds which any lady might be proud to hang up a suitable thing for what we call a refectory in a charitable institution if any gentleman of the corporation wished to show his munifi cence turn it a little sir yes joseph turn it a little towards mr ladislaw mr ladislaw having been abroad understands the merit of these things you observe all eyes were for a moment turned towards will who said coolly five pounds the auctioneer burst out in deep remonstrance ah mr ladislaw the frame alone is worth that ladies and gentlemen for the credit of the town suppose it should be discovered hereafter that a gem of art has been amongst us in this town and nobody in middlemarch awake to it five guineas five seven six five ten still ladies still it is a gem and full many a gem as the poet says has been allowed to go at a nominal price because the public knew no better because it was offered in circles where there was i was going to say a low feeling but no six pounds six guineas a guydo of the first order going at six guineas it is an insult to religion ladies it touches us all as christians gentlemen that a subject like this should go at such a low figure six pounds ten seven the bidding was brisk and will continued to share in it remembering that mrs bulstrode had a strong wish for the picture and thinking that he might stretch the price to twelve pounds but it was knocked down to him at ten guineas whereupon he pushed his way towards the bow window and went out he chose to go under the marquee to get a glass of water being hot and thirsty it was empty of other visitors and he asked the woman in attendance to fetch him some fresh water but before she was well gone he was annoyed to see entering the florid stranger who had stared at him it struck will at this moment that the man might be one of those political parasitic insects of the bloated kind who had once or twice claimed acquaintance with him as having heard him speak on the reform question and who might think of getting a shilling by news in this light his person already rather heating to behold on a summer s day appeared the more disagreeable and will half seated on the elbow of a garden chair turned his eyes carefully away from the comer but this signified little to our acquaintance mr raffles who never hesitated to thrust himself on unwilling observation if it suited his purpose to do so he moved a step or two till he was in front of will and said with full mouthed haste excuse me mr ladislaw was your mother s name sarah dunkirk will starting to his feet moved backward a step frowning and saying with some fierceness yes sir it was and what is that to you it was in will s nature that the first spark it threw out was a direct answer of the question and a challenge of the consequences to have said what is that to you in the first instance would have seemed like shuffling as if he minded who knew anything about his origin raffles on his side had not the same eagerness for a collision which was implied in ladislaw s threatening air the slim young fellow with his girl s complexion looked like a tiger cat ready to spring on him under such circumstances mr raffles s pleasure in annoying his company was kept in abeyance no offence my good sir no offence i only remember your mother knew her when she was a girl but it is your father that you feature sir i had the pleasure of seeing your father too parents alive mr ladislaw no thundered will in the same attitude as before should be glad to do you a service mr ladislaw by jove i should hope to meet again hereupon raffles who had lifted his hat with the last words turned himself round with a swing of his leg and walked away will looked after him a moment and could see that he did not re enter the auction room but appeared to be walking towards the road for an instant he thought that he had been foolish not to let the man go on talking but no on the whole he preferred doing without knowledge from that source later in the evening however raffles overtook him in the street and appearing either to have forgotten the roughness of his former reception or to intend avenging it by a forgiving familiarity greeted him jovially and walked by his side remarking at first on the pleasantness of the town and neighborhood will suspected that the man had been drinking and was considering how to shake him off when raffles said i ve been abroad myself mr ladislaw i ve seen the world used to parley vous a little it was at boulogne i saw your father a most uncommon likeness you are of him by jove mouth nose eyes hair turned off your brow just like his a little in the foreign style john bull doesn t do much of that but your father was very ill when i saw him lord lord hands you might see through you were a small youngster then did he get well no said will curtly ah well i ve often wondered what became of your mother she ran away from her friends when she was a young lass
GE(Mddlem...),it came shortly before the memorable meeting at the town hall and was nothing less than a letter from will ladislaw to lydgate which turned indeed chiefly on his new interest in plans of colonization but mentioned incidentally that he might find it necessary to pay a visit to middlemarch within the next few weeks a very pleasant necessity he said almost as good as holidays to a schoolboy he hoped there was his old place on the rug and a great deal of music in store for him but he was quite uncertain as to the time while lydgate was reading the letter to rosamond her face looked like a reviving flower it grew prettier and more blooming there was nothing unendurable now the debts were paid mr ladislaw was coming and lydgate would be persuaded to leave middlemarch and settle in london which was so different from a provincial town that was a bright bit of morning but soon the sky became black over poor rosamond the presence of a new gloom in her husband about which he was entirely reserved towards her for he dreaded to expose his lacerated feeling to her neutrality and misconception soon received a painfully strange explanation alien to all her previous notions of what could affect her happiness in the new gayety of her spirits thinking that lydgate had merely a worse fit of moodiness than usual causing him to leave her remarks unanswered and evidently to keep out of her way as much as possible she chose a few days after the meeting and without speaking to him on the subject to send out notes of invitation for a small evening party feeling convinced that this was a judicious step since people seemed to have been keeping aloof from them and wanted restoring to the old habit of intercourse when the invitations had been accepted she would tell lydgate and give him a wise admonition as to how a medical man should behave to his neighbors for rosamond had the gravest little airs possible about other people s duties but all the invitations were declined and the last answer came into lydgate s hands this is chichely s scratch what is he writing to you about said lydgate wonderingly as he handed the note to her she was obliged to let him see it and looking at her severely he said why on earth have you been sending out invitations without telling me rosamond i beg i insist that you will not invite any one to this house i suppose you have been inviting others and they have refused too she said nothing do you hear me thundered lydgate yes certainly i hear you said rosamond turning her head aside with the movement of a graceful long necked bird lydgate tossed his head without any grace and walked out of the room feeling himself dangerous rosamond s thought was that he was getting more and more unbearable not that there was any new special reason for this peremptoriness his indisposition to tell her anything in which he was sure beforehand that she would not be interested was growing into an unreflecting habit and she was in ignorance of everything connected with the thousand pounds except that the loan had come from her uncle bulstrode lydgate s odious humors and their neighbors apparent avoidance of them had an unaccountable date for her in their relief from money difficulties if the invitations had been accepted she would have gone to invite her mamma and the rest whom she had seen nothing of for several days and she now put on her bonnet to go and inquire what had become of them all suddenly feeling as if there were a conspiracy to leave her in isolation with a husband disposed to offend everybody it was after the dinner hour and she found her father and mother seated together alone in the drawing room they greeted her with sad looks saying well my dear and no more she had never seen her father look so downcast and seating herself near him she said is there anything the matter papa he did not answer but mrs vincy said oh my dear have you heard nothing it won t be long before it reaches you is it anything about tertius said rosamond turning pale the idea of trouble immediately connected itself with what had been unaccountable to her in him oh my dear yes to think of your marrying into this trouble debt was bad enough but this will be worse stay stay lucy said mr vincy have you heard nothing about your uncle bulstrode rosamond no papa said the poor thing feeling as if trouble were not anything she had before experienced but some invisible power with an iron grasp that made her soul faint within her her father told her everything saying at the end it s better for you to know my dear i think lydgate must leave the town things have gone against him i dare say he couldn t help it i don t accuse him of any harm said mr vincy he had always before been disposed to find the utmost fault with lydgate the shock to rosamond was terrible it seemed to her that no lot could be so cruelly hard as hers to have married a man who had become the centre of infamous suspicions in many cases it is inevitable that the shame is felt to be the worst part of crime and it would have required a great deal of disentangling reflection such as had never entered into rosamond s life for her in these moments to feel that her trouble was less than if her husband had been certainly known to have done something criminal all the shame seemed to be there and she had innocently married this man with the belief that he and his family were a glory to her she showed her usual reticence to her parents and only said that if lydgate had done as she wished he would have left middlemarch long ago she bears it beyond anything said her mother when she was gone ah thank god said mr vincy who was much broken down but rosamond went home with a sense of justified repugnance towards her husband what had he really done how had he really acted she did not know why had he not told her everything he did not speak to her on the subject and of course she could not speak to him it came into her mind once that she would ask her father to let her go home again but dwelling on that prospect made it seem utter dreariness to her a married woman gone back to live with her parents life seemed to have no meaning for her in such a position she could not contemplate herself in it the next two days lydgate observed a change in her and believed that she had heard the bad news would she speak to him about it or would she go on forever in the silence which seemed to imply that she believed him guilty we must remember that he was in a morbid state of mind in which almost all contact was pain certainly rosamond in this case had equal reason to complain of reserve and want of confidence on his part but in the bitterness of his soul he excused himself was he not justified in shrinking from the task of telling her since now she knew the truth she had no impulse to speak to him but a deeper lying consciousness that he was in fault made him restless and the silence between them became intolerable to him it was as if they were both adrift on one piece of wreck and looked away from each other he thought i am a fool haven t i given up expecting anything i have married care not help and that evening he said rosamond have you heard anything that distresses you yes she answered laying down her work which she had been carrying on with a languid semi consciousness most unlike her usual self what have you heard everything i suppose papa told me that people think me disgraced yes said rosamond faintly beginning to sew again automatically there was silence lydgate thought if she has any trust in me any notion of what i am she ought to speak now and say that she does not believe i have deserved disgrace but rosamond on her side went on moving her fingers languidly whatever was to be said on the subject she expected to come from tertius what did she know and if he were innocent of any wrong why did he not do something to clear himself this silence of hers brought a new rush of gall to that bitter mood in which lydgate had been saying to himself that nobody believed in him even farebrother had not come forward he had begun to question her with the intent that their conversation should disperse the chill fog which had gathered between them but he felt his resolution checked by despairing resentment even this trouble like the rest she seemed to regard as if it were hers alone he was always to her a being apart doing what she objected to he started from his chair with an angry impulse and thrusting his hands in his pockets walked up and down the room there was an underlying consciousness all the while that he should have to master this anger and tell her everything and convince her of the facts for he had almost learned the lesson that he must bend himself to her nature and that because she came short in her sympathy he must give the more soon he recurred to his intention of opening himself the occasion must not be lost if he could bring her to feel with some solemnity that here was a slander which must be met and not run away from and that the whole trouble had come out of his desperate want of money it would be a moment for urging powerfully on her that they should be one in the resolve to do with as little money as possible so that they might weather the bad time and keep themselves independent he would mention the definite measures which he desired to take and win her to a willing spirit he was bound to try this and what else was there for him to do he did not know how long he had been walking uneasily backwards and forwards but rosamond felt that it was long and wished that he would sit down she too had begun to think this an opportunity for urging on tertius what he ought to do whatever might be the truth about all this misery there was one dread which asserted itself lydgate at last seated himself not in his usual chair but in one nearer to rosamond leaning aside in it towards her and looking at her gravely before he reopened the sad subject he had conquered himself so far and was about to speak with a sense of solemnity as on an occasion which was not to be repeated he had even opened his lips when rosamond letting her hands fall looked at him and said surely tertius well surely now at last you have given up the idea of staying in middlemarch i cannot go on living here let us go to london papa and every one else says you had better go whatever misery i have to put up with it will be easier away from here lydgate felt miserably jarred instead of that critical outpouring for which he had prepared himself with effort here was the old round to be gone through again he could not bear it with a quick change of countenance he rose and went out of the room perhaps if he had been strong enough to persist in his determination to be the more because she was less that evening might have had a better issue if his energy could have borne down that check he might still have wrought on rosamond s vision and will we cannot be sure that any natures however inflexible or peculiar will resist this effect from a more massive being than their own they may be taken by storm and for the moment converted becoming part of the soul which enwraps them in the ardor of its movement but poor lydgate had a throbbing pain within him and his energy had fallen short of its task the beginning of mutual understanding and resolve seemed as far off as ever nay it seemed blocked out by the sense of unsuccessful effort they lived on from day to day with their thoughts still apart lydgate going about what work he had in a mood of despair and rosamond feeling with some justification that he was behaving cruelly it was of no use to say anything to tertius but when will ladislaw came she was determined to tell him everything in spite of her general reticence she needed some one who would recognize her wrongs some days later lydgate was riding to lowick manor in consequence of a summons from dorothea the summons had not been unexpected since it had followed a letter from mr bulstrode in which he stated that he had resumed his arrangements for quitting middlemarch and must remind lydgate of his previous communications about the hospital to the purport of which he still adhered it had been his duty before taking further steps to reopen the subject with mrs casaubon who now wished as before to discuss the question with lydgate your views may possibly have undergone some change wrote mr bulstrode but in that case also it is desirable that you should lay them before her dorothea awaited his arrival with eager interest though in deference to her masculine advisers she had refrained from what sir james had called interfering in this bulstrode business the hardship of lydgate s position was continually in her mind and when bulstrode applied to her again about the hospital she felt that the opportunity was come to her which she had been hindered from hastening in her luxurious home wandering under the boughs of her own great trees her thought was going out over the lot of others and her emotions were imprisoned the idea of some active good within her reach haunted her like a passion and another s need having once come to her as a distinct image preoccupied her desire with the yearning to give relief and made her own ease tasteless she was full of confident hope about this interview with lydgate never heeding what was said of his personal reserve never heeding that she was a very young woman nothing could have seemed more irrelevant to dorothea than insistence on her youth and sex when she was moved to show her human fellowship as she sat waiting in the library she could do nothing but live through again all the past scenes which had brought lydgate into her memories they all owed their significance to her marriage and its troubles but no there were two occasions in which the image of lydgate had come painfully in connection with his wife and some one else the pain had been allayed for dorothea but it had left in her an awakened conjecture as to what lydgate s marriage might be to him a susceptibility to the slightest hint about mrs lydgate these thoughts were like a drama to her and made her eyes bright and gave an attitude of suspense to her whole frame though she was only looking out from the brown library on to the turf and the bright green buds which stood in relief against the dark evergreens when lydgate came in she was almost shocked at the change in his face which was strikingly perceptible to her who had not seen him for two months it was not the change of emaciation but that effect which even young faces will very soon show from the persistent presence of resentment and despondency her cordial look when she put out her hand to him softened his expression but only with melancholy i have wished very much to see you for a long while mr lydgate said dorothea when they were seated opposite each other but i put off asking you to come until mr bulstrode applied to me again about the hospital i know that the advantage of keeping the management of it separate from that of the infirmary depends on you or at least on the good which you are encouraged to hope for from having it under your control and i am sure you will not refuse to tell me exactly what you think you want to decide whether you should give a generous support to the hospital said lydgate i cannot conscientiously advise you to do it in dependence on any activity of mine i may be obliged to leave the town he spoke curtly feeling the ache of despair as to his being able to carry out any purpose that rosamond had set her mind against not because there is no one to believe in you said dorothea pouring out her words in clearness from a full heart i know the unhappy mistakes about you i knew them from the first moment to be mistakes you have never done anything vile you would not do anything dishonorable it was the first assurance of belief in him that had fallen on lydgate s ears he drew a deep breath and said thank you he could say no more it was something very new and strange in his life that these few words of trust from a woman should be so much to him i beseech you to tell me how everything was said dorothea fearlessly i am sure that the truth would clear you lydgate started up from his chair and went towards the window forgetting where he was he had so often gone over in his mind the possibility of explaining everything without aggravating appearances that would tell perhaps unfairly against bulstrode and had so often decided against it he had so often said to himself that his assertions would not change people s impressions that dorothea s words sounded like a temptation to do something which in his soberness he had pronounced to be unreasonable tell me pray said dorothea with simple earnestness then we can consult together it is wicked to let people think evil of any one falsely when it can be hindered lydgate turned remembering where he was and saw dorothea s face looking up at him with a sweet trustful gravity the presence of a noble nature generous in its wishes ardent in its charity changes the lights for us we begin to see things again in their larger quieter masses and to believe that we too can be seen and judged in the wholeness of our character that influence was beginning to act on lydgate who had for many days been seeing all life as one who is dragged and struggling amid the throng he sat down again and felt that he was recovering his old self in the consciousness that he was with one who believed in it i don t want he said to bear hard on bulstrode who has lent me money of which i was in need though i would rather have gone without it now he is hunted down and miserable and has only a poor thread of life in him but i should like to tell you everything it will be a comfort to me to speak where belief has gone beforehand and where i shall not seem to be offering assertions of my own honesty you will feel what is fair to another as you feel what is fair to me do trust me said dorothea i will not repeat anything without your leave but at the very least i could say that you have made all the circumstances clear to me and that i know you are not in any way guilty mr farebrother would believe me and my uncle and sir james chettam nay there are persons in middlemarch to whom i could go although they don t know much of me they would believe me they would know that i could have no other motive than truth and justice i would take any pains to clear you i have very little to do there is nothing better that i can do in the world dorothea s voice as she made this childlike picture of what she would do might have been almost taken as a proof that she could do it effectively the searching tenderness of her woman s tones seemed made for a defence against ready accusers lydgate did not stay to think that she was quixotic he gave himself up for the first time in his life to the exquisite sense of leaning entirely on a generous sympathy without any check of proud reserve and he told her everything from the time when under the pressure of his difficulties he unwillingly made his first application to bulstrode gradually in the relief of speaking getting into a more thorough utterance of what had gone on in his mind entering fully into the fact that his treatment of the patient was opposed to the dominant practice into his doubts at the last his ideal of medical duty and his uneasy consciousness that the acceptance of the money had made some difference in his private inclination and professional behavior though not in his fulfilment of any publicly recognized obligation it has come to my knowledge since he added that hawley sent some one to examine the housekeeper at stone court and she said that she gave the patient all the opium in the phial i left as well as a good deal of brandy but that would not have been opposed to ordinary prescriptions even of first rate men the suspicions against me had no hold there they are grounded on the knowledge that i took money that bulstrode had strong motives for wishing the man to die and that he gave me the money as a bribe to concur in some malpractices or other against the patient that in any case i accepted a bribe to hold my tongue they are just the suspicions that cling the most obstinately because they lie in people s inclination and can never be disproved how my orders came to be disobeyed is a question to which i don t know the answer it is still possible that bulstrode was innocent of any criminal intention even possible that he had nothing to do with the disobedience and merely abstained from mentioning it but all that has nothing to do with the public belief it is one of those cases on which a man is condemned on the ground of his character it is believed that he has committed a crime in some undefined way because he had the motive for doing it and bulstrode s character has enveloped me because i took his money i am simply blighted like a damaged ear of corn the business is done and can t be undone oh it is hard said dorothea i understand the difficulty there is in your vindicating yourself and that all this should have come to you who had meant to lead a higher life than the common and to find out better ways i cannot bear to rest in this as unchangeable i know you meant that i remember what you said to me when you first spoke to me about the hospital there is no

TH(Tess...),she was seeing it then to decline to marry him after all in obedience to her emotion of last night and leave the dairy meant to go to some strange place not a dairy for milkmaids were not in request now calving time was coming on to go to some arable farm where no divine being like angel clare was she hated the thought and she hated more the thought of going home so that seriously dearest tess he continued since you will probably have to leave at christmas it is in every way desirable and convenient that i should carry you off then as my property besides if you were not the most uncalculating girl in the world you would know that we could not go on like this for ever i wish we could that it would always be summer and autumn and you always courting me and always thinking as much of me as you have done through the past summer time i always shall o i know you will she cried with a sudden fervour of faith in him angel i will fix the day when i will become yours for always thus at last it was arranged between them during that dark walk home amid the myriads of liquid voices on the right and left when they reached the dairy mr and mrs crick were promptly told with injunctions of secrecy for each of the lovers was desirous that the marriage should be kept as private as possible the dairyman though he had thought of dismissing her soon now made a great concern about losing her what should he do about his skimming who would make the ornamental butter pats for the anglebury and sandbourne ladies mrs crick congratulated tess on the shilly shallying having at last come to an end and said that directly she set eyes on tess she divined that she was to be the chosen one of somebody who was no common outdoor man tess had looked so superior as she walked across the barton on that afternoon of her arrival that she was of a good family she could have sworn in point of fact mrs crick did remember thinking that tess was graceful and good looking as she approached but the superiority might have been a growth of the imagination aided by subsequent knowledge tess was now carried along upon the wings of the hours without the sense of a will the word had been given the number of the day written down her naturally bright intelligence had begun to admit the fatalistic convictions common to field folk and those who associate more extensively with natural phenomena than with their fellow creatures and she accordingly drifted into that passive responsiveness to all things her lover suggested characteristic of the frame of mind but she wrote anew to her mother ostensibly to notify the wedding day really to again implore her advice it was a gentleman who had chosen her which perhaps her mother had not sufficiently considered a post nuptial explanation which might be accepted with a light heart by a rougher man might not be received with the same feeling by him but this communication brought no reply from mrs durbeyfield despite angel clare s plausible representation to himself and to tess of the practical need for their immediate marriage there was in truth an element of precipitancy in the step as became apparent at a later date he loved her dearly though perhaps rather ideally and fancifully than with the impassioned thoroughness of her feeling for him he had entertained no notion when doomed as he had thought to an unintellectual bucolic life that such charms as he beheld in this idyllic creature would be found behind the scenes unsophistication was a thing to talk of but he had not known how it really struck one until he came here yet he was very far from seeing his future track clearly and it might be a year or two before he would be able to consider himself fairly started in life the secret lay in the tinge of recklessness imparted to his career and character by the sense that he had been made to miss his true destiny through the prejudices of his family don t you think twould have been better for us to wait till you were quite settled in your midland farm she once asked timidly a midland farm was the idea just then to tell the truth my tess i don t like you to be left anywhere away from my protection and sympathy the reason was a good one so far as it went his influence over her had been so marked that she had caught his manner and habits his speech and phrases his likings and his aversions and to leave her in farmland would be to let her slip back again out of accord with him he wished to have her under his charge for another reason his parents had naturally desired to see her once at least before he carried her off to a distant settlement english or colonial and as no opinion of theirs was to be allowed to change his intention he judged that a couple of months life with him in lodgings whilst seeking for an advantageous opening would be of some social assistance to her at what she might feel to be a trying ordeal her presentation to his mother at the vicarage next he wished to see a little of the working of a flour mill having an idea that he might combine the use of one with corn growing the proprietor of a large old water mill at wellbridge once the mill of an abbey had offered him the inspection of his time honoured mode of procedure and a hand in the operations for a few days whenever he should choose to come clare paid a visit to the place some few miles distant one day at this time to inquire particulars and returned to talbothays in the evening she found him determined to spend a short time at the wellbridge flour mills and what had determined him less the opportunity of an insight into grinding and bolting than the casual fact that lodgings were to be obtained in that very farmhouse which before its mutilation had been the mansion of a branch of the durberville family this was always how clare settled practical questions by a sentiment which had nothing to do with them they decided to go immediately after the wedding and remain for a fortnight instead of journeying to towns and inns then we will start off to examine some farms on the other side of london that i have heard of he said and by march or april we will pay a visit to my father and mother questions of procedure such as these arose and passed and the day the incredible day on which she was to become his loomed large in the near future the thirty first of december new year s eve was the date his wife she said to herself could it ever be their two selves together nothing to divide them every incident shared by them why not and yet why one sunday morning izz huett returned from church and spoke privately to tess you was not called home this morning what it should ha been the first time of asking to day she answered looking quietly at tess you meant to be married new year s eve deary the other returned a quick affirmative and there must be three times of asking and now there be only two sundays left between tess felt her cheek paling izz was right of course there must be three perhaps he had forgotten if so there must be a week s postponement and that was unlucky how could she remind her lover she who had been so backward was suddenly fired with impatience and alarm lest she should lose her dear prize a natural incident relieved her anxiety izz mentioned the omission of the banns to mrs crick and mrs crick assumed a matron s privilege of speaking to angel on the point have ye forgot em mr clare the banns i mean no i have not forgot em says clare as soon as he caught tess alone he assured her don t let them tease you about the banns a licence will be quieter for us and i have decided on a licence without consulting you so if you go to church on sunday morning you will not hear your own name if you wished to i didn t wish to hear it dearest she said proudly but to know that things were in train was an immense relief to tess notwithstanding who had well nigh feared that somebody would stand up and forbid the banns on the ground of her history how events were favouring her i don t quite feel easy she said to herself all this good fortune may be scourged out of me afterwards by a lot of ill that s how heaven mostly does i wish i could have had common banns but everything went smoothly she wondered whether he would like her to be married in her present best white frock or if she ought to buy a new one the question was set at rest by his forethought disclosed by the arrival of some large packages addressed to her inside them she found a whole stock of clothing from bonnet to shoes including a perfect morning costume such as would well suit the simple wedding they planned he entered the house shortly after the arrival of the packages and heard her upstairs undoing them a minute later she came down with a flush on her face and tears in her eyes how thoughtful you ve been she murmured her cheek upon his shoulder even to the gloves and handkerchief my own love how good how kind no no tess just an order to a tradeswoman in london nothing more and to divert her from thinking too highly of him he told her to go upstairs and take her time and see if it all fitted and if not to get the village sempstress to make a few alterations she did return upstairs and put on the gown alone she stood for a moment before the glass looking at the effect of her silk attire and then there came into her head her mother s ballad of the mystic robe that never would become that wife that had once done amiss which mrs durbeyfield had used to sing to her as a child so blithely and so archly her foot on the cradle which she rocked to the tune suppose this robe should betray her by changing colour as her robe had betrayed queen guinevere since she had been at the dairy she had not once thought of the lines till now angel felt that he would like to spend a day with her before the wedding somewhere away from the dairy as a last jaunt in her company while there were yet mere lover and mistress a romantic day in circumstances that would never be repeated with that other and greater day beaming close ahead of them during the preceding week therefore he suggested making a few purchases in the nearest town and they started together clare s life at the dairy had been that of a recluse in respect the world of his own class for months he had never gone near a town and requiring no vehicle had never kept one hiring the dairyman s cob or gig if he rode or drove they went in the gig that day and then for the first time in their lives they shopped as partners in one concern it was christmas eve with its loads a holly and mistletoe and the town was very full of strangers who had come in from all parts of the country on account of the day tess paid the penalty of walking about with happiness superadded to beauty on her countenance by being much stared at as she moved amid them on his arm in the evening they returned to the inn at which they had put up and tess waited in the entry while angel went to see the horse and gig brought to the door the general sitting room was full of guests who were continually going in and out as the door opened and shut each time for the passage of these the light within the parlour fell full upon tess s face two men came out and passed by her among the rest one of them had stared her up and down in surprise and she fancied he was a trantridge man though that village lay so many miles off that trantridge folk were rarities here a comely maid that said the other true comely enough but unless i make a great mistake and he negatived the remainder of the definition forthwith clare had just returned from the stable yard and confronting the man on the threshold heard the words and saw the shrinking of tess the insult to her stung him to the quick and before he had considered anything at all he struck the man on the chin with the full force of his fist sending him staggering backwards into the passage the man recovered himself and seemed inclined to come on and clare stepping outside the door put himself in a posture of defence but his opponent began to think better of the matter he looked anew at tess as he passed her and said to clare i beg pardon sir twas a complete mistake i thought she was another woman forty miles from here clare feeling then that he had been too hasty and that he was moreover to blame for leaving her standing in an inn passage did what he usually did in such cases gave the man five shillings to plaster the blow and thus they parted bidding each other a pacific good night as soon as clare had taken the reins from the ostler and the young couple had driven off the two men went in the other direction and was it a mistake said the second one not a bit of it but i didn t want to hurt the gentleman s feelings not i in the meantime the lovers were driving onward could we put off our wedding till a little later tess asked in a dry dull voice i mean if we wished no my love calm yourself do you mean that the fellow may have time to summon me for assault he asked good humouredly no i only meant if it should have to be put off what she meant was not very clear and he directed her to dismiss such fancies from her mind which she obediently did as well as she could but she was grave very grave all the way home till she thought we shall go away a very long distance hundreds of miles from these parts and such as this can never happen again and no ghost of the past reach there they parted tenderly that night on the landing and clare ascended to his attic tess sat up getting on with some little requisites lest the few remaining days should not afford sufficient time while she sat she heard a noise in angel s room overhead a sound of thumping and struggling everybody else in the house was asleep and in her anxiety lest clare should be ill she ran up and knocked at his door and asked him what was the matter oh nothing dear he said from within i am so sorry i disturbed you but the reason is rather an amusing one i fell asleep and dreamt that i was fighting that fellow again who insulted you and the noise you heard was my pummelling away with my fists at my portmanteau which i pulled out to day for packing i am occasionally liable to these freaks in my sleep go to bed and think of it no more this was the last drachm required to turn the scale of her indecision declare the past to him by word of mouth she could not but there was another way she sat down and wrote on the four pages of a note sheet a succinct narrative of those events of three or four years ago put it into an envelope and directed it to clare then lest the flesh should again be weak she crept upstairs without any shoes and slipped the note under his door her night was a broken one as it well might be and she listened for the first faint noise overhead it came as usual he descended as usual she descended he met her at the bottom of the stairs and kissed her surely it was as warmly as ever he looked a little disturbed and worn she thought but he said not a word to her about her revelation even when they were alone could he have had it unless he began the subject she felt that she could say nothing so the day passed and it was evident that whatever he thought he meant to keep to himself yet he was frank and affectionate as before could it be that her doubts were childish that he forgave her that he loved her for what she was just as she was and smiled at her disquiet as at a foolish nightmare had he really received her note she glanced into his room and could see nothing of it it might be that he forgave her but even if he had not received it she had a sudden enthusiastic trust that he surely would forgive her every morning and night he was the same and thus new year s eve broke the wedding day the lovers did not rise at milking time having through the whole of this last week of their sojourn at the dairy been accorded something of the position of guests tess being honoured with a room of her own when they arrived downstairs at breakfast time they were surprised to see what effects had been produced in the large kitchen for their glory since they had last beheld it at some unnatural hour of the morning the dairyman had caused the yawning chimney corner to be whitened and the brick hearth reddened and a blazing yellow damask blower to be hung across the arch in place of the old grimy blue cotton one with a black sprig pattern which had formerly done duty there this renovated aspect of what was the focus indeed of the room on a full winter morning threw a smiling demeanour over the whole apartment i was determined to do summat in honour o t said the dairyman and as you wouldn t hear of my gieing a rattling good randy wi fiddles and bass viols complete as we should ha done in old times this was all i could think o as a noiseless thing tess s friends lived so far off that none could conveniently have been present at the ceremony even had any been asked but as a fact nobody was invited from marlott as for angel s family he had written and duly informed them of the time and assured them that he would be glad to see one at least of them there for the day if he would like to come his brothers had not replied at all seeming to be indignant with him while his father and mother had written a rather sad letter deploring his precipitancy in rushing into marriage but making the best of the matter by saying that though a dairywoman was the last daughter in law they could have expected their son had arrived at an age which he might be supposed to be the best judge this coolness in his relations distressed clare less than it would have done had he been without the grand card with which he meant to surprise them ere long to produce tess fresh from the dairy as a durberville and a lady he had felt to be temerarious and risky hence he had concealed her lineage till such time as familiarized with worldly ways by a few months travel and reading with him he could take her on a visit to his parents and impart the knowledge while triumphantly producing her as worthy of such an ancient line it was a pretty lover s dream if no more perhaps tess s lineage had more value for himself than for anybody in the world beside her perception that angel s bearing towards her still remained in no whit altered by her own communication rendered tess guiltily doubtful if he could have received it she rose from breakfast before he had finished and hastened upstairs it had occurred to her to look once more into the queer gaunt room which had been clare s den or rather eyrie for so long and climbing the ladder she stood at the open door of the apartment regarding and pondering she stooped to the threshold of the doorway where she had pushed in the note two or three days earlier in such excitement the carpet reached close to the sill and under the edge of the carpet she discerned the faint white margin of the envelope containing her letter to him which he obviously had never seen owing to her having in her haste thrust it beneath the carpet as well as beneath the door with a feeling of faintness she withdrew the letter there it was sealed up just as it had left her hands the mountain had not yet been removed she could not let him read it now the house being in full bustle of preparation and descending to her own room she destroyed the letter there she was so pale when he saw her again that he felt quite anxious the incident of the misplaced letter she had jumped at as if it prevented a confession but she knew in her conscience that it need not there was still time yet everything was in a stir there was coming and going all had to dress the dairyman and mrs crick having been asked to accompany them as witnesses and reflection or deliberate talk was well nigh impossible the only minute tess could get to be alone with clare was when they met upon the landing i am so anxious to talk to you i want to confess all my faults and blunders she said with attempted lightness no no we can t have faults talked of you must be deemed perfect to day at least my sweet he cried we shall have plenty of time hereafter i hope to talk over our failings i will confess mine at the same time but it would be better for me to do it now i think so that you could not say well my quixotic one you shall tell me anything say as soon as we are settled in our lodging not now i too will tell you my faults then but do not let us spoil the day with them they will be excellent matter for a dull time then you don t wish me to dearest i do not tessy really the hurry of dressing and starting left no time for more than this those words of his seemed to reassure her on further reflection she was whirled onward through the next couple of critical hours by the mastering tide of her devotion to him which closed up further meditation her one desire so long resisted to make herself his
TH(Tess...),by experience says roger ascham we find out a short way by a long wandering not seldom that long wandering unfits us for further travel and of what use is our experience to us then tess durbeyfield s experience was of this incapacitating kind at last she had learned what to do but who would now accept her doing if before going to the durbervilles she had vigorously moved under the guidance of sundry gnomic texts and phrases known to her and to the world in general no doubt she would never have been imposed on but it had not been in tess s power nor is it in anybody s power to feel the whole truth of golden opinions while it is possible to profit by them she and how many more might have ironically said to god with saint augustine thou hast counselled a better course than thou hast permitted she remained at her father s house during the winter months plucking fowls or cramming turkeys and geese or making clothes for her sisters and brothers out of some finery which durberville had given her and she had put by with contempt apply to him she would not but she would often clasp her hands behind her head and muse when she was supposed to be working hard she philosophically noted dates as they came past in the revolution of the year the disastrous night of her undoing at trantridge with its dark background of the chase also the dates of the baby s birth and death also her own birthday and every other day individualized by incidents in which she had taken some share she suddenly thought one afternoon when looking in the glass at her fairness that there was yet another date of greater importance to her than those that of her own death when all these charms would have disappeared a day which lay sly and unseen among all the other days of the year giving no sign or sound when she annually passed over it but not the less surely there when was it why did she not feel the chill of each yearly encounter with such a cold relation she had jeremy taylor s thought that some time in the future those who had known her would say it is the th the day that poor tess durbeyfield died and there would be nothing singular to their minds in the statement of that day doomed to be her terminus in time through all the ages she did not know the place in month week season or year almost at a leap tess thus changed from simple girl to complex woman symbols of reflectiveness passed into her face and a note of tragedy at times into her voice her eyes grew larger and more eloquent she became what would have been called a fine creature her aspect was fair and arresting her soul that of a woman whom the turbulent experiences of the last year or two had quite failed to demoralize but for the world s opinion those experiences would have been simply a liberal education she had held so aloof of late that her trouble never generally known was nearly forgotten in marlott but it became evident to her that she could never be really comfortable again in a place which had seen the collapse of her family s attempt to claim kin and through her even closer union with the rich durbervilles at least she could not be comfortable there till long years should have obliterated her keen consciousness of it yet even now tess felt the pulse of hopeful life still warm within her she might be happy in some nook which had no memories to escape the past and all that appertained thereto was to annihilate it and to do that she would have to get away was once lost always lost really true of chastity she would ask herself she might prove it false if she could veil bygones the recuperative power which pervaded organic nature was surely not denied to maidenhood alone she waited a long time without finding opportunity for a new departure a particularly fine spring came round and the stir of germination was almost audible in the buds it moved her as it moved the wild animals and made her passionate to go at last one day in early may a letter reached her from a former friend of her mother s to whom she had addressed inquiries long before a person whom she had never seen that a skilful milkmaid was required at a dairy house many miles to the southward and that the dairyman would be glad to have her for the summer months it was not quite so far off as could have been wished but it was probably far enough her radius of movement and repute having been so small to persons of limited spheres miles are as geographical degrees parishes as counties counties as provinces and kingdoms on one point she was resolved there should be no more durberville air castles in the dreams and deeds of her new life she would be the dairymaid tess and nothing more her mother knew tess s feeling on this point so well though no words had passed between them on the subject that she never alluded to the knightly ancestry now yet such is human inconsistency that one of the interests of the new place to her was the accidental virtues of its lying near her forefathers country for they were not blakemore men though her mother was blakemore to the bone the dairy called talbothays for which she was bound stood not remotely from some of the former estates of the durbervilles near the great family vaults of her granddames and their powerful husbands she would be able to look at them and think not only that durberville like babylon had fallen but that the individual innocence of a humble descendant could lapse as silently all the while she wondered if any strange good thing might come of her being in her ancestral land and some spirit within her rose automatically as the sap in the twigs it was unexpected youth surging up anew after its temporary check and bringing with it hope and the invincible instinct towards self delight on a thyme scented bird hatching morning in may between two and three years after the return from trantridge silent reconstructive years for tess durbeyfield she left her home for the second time having packed up her luggage so that it could be sent to her later she started in a hired trap for the little town of stourcastle through which it was necessary to pass on her journey now in a direction almost opposite to that of her first adventuring on the curve of the nearest hill she looked back regretfully at marlott and her father s house although she had been so anxious to get away her kindred dwelling there would probably continue their daily lives as heretofore with no great diminution of pleasure in their consciousness although she would be far off and they deprived of her smile in a few days the children would engage in their games as merrily as ever without the sense of any gap left by her departure this leaving of the younger children she had decided to be for the best were she to remain they would probably gain less good by her precepts than harm by her example she went through stourcastle without pausing and onward to a junction of highways where she could await a carrier s van that ran to the south west for the railways which engirdled this interior tract of country had never yet struck across it while waiting however there came along a farmer in his spring cart driving approximately in the direction that she wished to pursue though he was a stranger to her she accepted his offer of a seat beside him ignoring that its motive was a mere tribute to her countenance he was going to weatherbury and by accompanying him thither she could walk the remainder of the distance instead of travelling in the van by way of casterbridge tess did not stop at weatherbury after this long drive further than to make a slight nondescript meal at noon at a cottage to which the farmer recommended her thence she started on foot basket in hand to reach the wide upland of heath dividing this district from the low lying meads of a further valley in which the dairy stood that was the aim and end of her day s pilgrimage tess had never before visited this part of the country and yet she felt akin to the landscape not so very far to the left of her she could discern a dark patch in the scenery which inquiry confirmed her in supposing to be trees marking the environs of kingsbere in the church of which parish the bones of her ancestors her useless ancestors lay entombed she had no admiration for them now she almost hated them for the dance they had led her not a thing of all that had been theirs did she retain but the old seal and spoon pooh i have as much of mother as father in me she said all my prettiness comes from her and she was only a dairymaid the journey over the intervening uplands and lowlands of egdon when she reached them was a more troublesome walk than she had anticipated the distance being actually but a few miles it was two hours owing to sundry wrong turnings ere she found herself on a summit commanding the long sought for vale the valley of the great dairies the valley in which milk and butter grew to rankness and were produced more profusely if less delicately than at her home the verdant plain so well watered by the river var or froom it was intrinsically different from the vale of little dairies blackmoor vale which save during her disastrous sojourn at trantridge she had exclusively known till now the world was drawn to a larger pattern here the enclosures numbered fifty acres instead of ten the farmsteads were more extended the groups of cattle formed tribes hereabout there only families these myriads of cows stretching under her eyes from the far east to the far west outnumbered any she had ever seen at one glance before the green lea was speckled as thickly with them as a canvas by van alsloot or sallaert with burghers the ripe hue of the red and dun kine absorbed the evening sunlight which the white coated animals returned to the eye in rays almost dazzling even at the distant elevation on which she stood the bird s eye perspective before her was not so luxuriantly beautiful perhaps as that other one which she knew so well yet it was more cheering it lacked the intensely blue atmosphere of the rival vale and its heavy soils and scents the new air was clear bracing ethereal the river itself which nourished the grass and cows of these renowned dairies flowed not like the streams in blackmoor those were slow silent often turbid flowing over beds of mud into which the incautious wader might sink and vanish unawares the froom waters were clear as the pure river of life shown to the evangelist rapid as the shadow of a cloud with pebbly shallows that prattled to the sky all day long there the water flower was the lily the crow foot here either the change in the quality of the air from heavy to light or the sense of being amid new scenes where there were no invidious eyes upon her sent up her spirits wonderfully her hopes mingled with the sunshine in an ideal photosphere which surrounded her as she bounded along against the soft south wind she heard a pleasant voice in every breeze and in every bird s note seemed to lurk a joy her face had latterly changed with changing states of mind continually fluctuating between beauty and ordinariness according as the thoughts were gay or grave one day she was pink and flawless another pale and tragical when she was pink she was feeling less than when pale her more perfect beauty accorded with her less elevated mood her more intense mood with her less perfect beauty it was her best face physically that was now set against the south wind the irresistible universal automatic tendency to find sweet pleasure somewhere which pervades all life from the meanest to the highest had at length mastered tess being even now only a young woman of twenty one who mentally and sentimentally had not finished growing it was impossible that any event should have left upon her an impression that was not in time capable of transmutation and thus her spirits and her thankfulness and her hopes rose higher and higher she tried several ballads but found them inadequate till recollecting the psalter that her eyes had so often wandered over of a sunday morning before she had eaten of the tree of knowledge she chanted o ye sun and moon o ye stars ye green things upon the earth ye fowls of the air beasts and cattle children of men bless ye the lord praise him and magnify him forever she suddenly stopped and murmured but perhaps i don t quite know the lord as yet and probably the half unconscious rhapsody was a fetishistic utterance in a monotheistic setting women whose chief companions are the forms and forces of outdoor nature retain in their souls far more of the pagan fantasy of their remote forefathers than of the systematized religion taught their race at later date however tess found at least approximate expression for her feelings in the old benedicite that she had lisped from infancy and it was enough such high contentment with such a slight initial performance as that of having started towards a means of independent living was a part of the durbeyfield temperament tess really wished to walk uprightly while her father did nothing of the kind but she resembled him in being content with immediate and small achievements and in having no mind for laborious effort towards such petty social advancement as could alone be effected by a family so heavily handicapped as the once powerful durbervilles were now there was it might be said the energy of her mother s unexpended family as well as the natural energy of tess s years rekindled after the experience which had so overwhelmed her for the time let the truth be told women do as a rule live through such humiliations and regain their spirits and again look about them with an interested eye while there s life there s hope is a conviction not so entirely unknown to the betrayed as some amiable theorists would have us believe tess durbeyfield then in good heart and full of zest for life descended the egdon slopes lower and lower towards the dairy of her pilgrimage the marked difference in the final particular between the rival vales now showed itself the secret of blackmoor was best discovered from the heights around to read aright the valley before her it was necessary to descend into its midst when tess had accomplished this feat she found herself to be standing on a carpeted level which stretched to the east and west as far as the eye could reach the river had stolen from the higher tracts and brought in particles to the vale all this horizontal land and now exhausted aged and attenuated lay serpentining along through the midst of its former spoils not quite sure of her direction tess stood still upon the hemmed expanse of verdant flatness like a fly on a billiard table of indefinite length and of no more consequence to the surroundings than that fly the sole effect of her presence upon the placid valley so far had been to excite the mind of a solitary heron which after descending to the ground not far from her path stood with neck erect looking at her suddenly there arose from all parts of the lowland a prolonged and repeated call waow waow waow from the furthest east to the furthest west the cries spread as if by contagion accompanied in some cases by the barking of a dog it was not the expression of the valley s consciousness that beautiful tess had arrived but the ordinary announcement of milking time half past four o clock when the dairymen set about getting in the cows the red and white herd nearest at hand which had been phlegmatically waiting for the call now trooped towards the steading in the background their great bags of milk swinging under them as they walked tess followed slowly in their rear and entered the barton by the open gate through which they had entered before her long thatched sheds stretched round the enclosure their slopes encrusted with vivid green moss and their eaves supported by wooden posts rubbed to a glossy smoothness by the flanks of infinite cows and calves of bygone years now passed to an oblivion almost inconceivable in its profundity between the post were ranged the milchers each exhibiting herself at the present moment to a whimsical eye in the rear as a circle on two stalks down the centre of which a switch moved pendulum wise while the sun lowering itself behind this patient row threw their shadows accurately inwards upon the wall thus it threw shadows of these obscure and homely figures every evening with as much care over each contour as if it had been the profile of a court beauty on a palace wall copied them as diligently as it had copied olympian shapes on marble façades long ago or the outline of alexander caesar and the pharaohs they were the less restful cows that were stalled those that would stand still of their own will were milked in the middle of the yard where many of such better behaved ones stood waiting now all prime milchers such as were seldom seen out of this valley and not always within it nourished by the succulent feed which the water meads supplied at this prime season of the year those of them that were spotted with white reflected the sunshine in dazzling brilliancy and the polished brass knobs of their horns glittered with something of military display their large veined udders hung ponderous as sandbags the teats sticking out like the legs of a gipsy s crock and as each animal lingered for her turn to arrive the milk oozed forth and fell in drops to the ground the dairymaids and men had flocked down from their cottages and out of the dairy house with the arrival of the cows from the meads the maids walking in pattens not on account of the weather but to keep their shoes above the mulch of the barton each girl sat down on her three legged stool her face sideways her right cheek resting against the cow and looked musingly along the animal s flank at tess as she approached the male milkers with hat brims turned down resting flat on their foreheads and gazing on the ground did not observe her one of these was a sturdy middle aged man whose long white pinner was somewhat finer and cleaner than the wraps of the others and whose jacket underneath had a presentable marketing aspect the master dairyman of whom she was in quest his double character as a working milker and butter maker here during six days and on the seventh as a man in shining broad cloth in his family pew at church being so marked as to have inspired a rhyme dairyman dick all the week on sundays mister richard crick seeing tess standing at gaze he went across to her the majority of dairymen have a cross manner at milking time but it happened that mr crick was glad to get a new hand for the days were busy ones now and he received her warmly inquiring for her mother and the rest of the family though this as a matter of form merely for in reality he had not been aware of mrs durbeyfield s existence till apprised of the fact by a brief business letter about tess oh ay as a lad i knowed your part o the country very well he said terminatively though i ve never been there since and a aged woman of ninety that use to live nigh here but is dead and gone long ago told me that a family of some such name as yours in blackmoor vale came originally from these parts and that twere a old ancient race that had all but perished off the earth though the new generations didn t know it but lord i took no notice of the old woman s ramblings not i oh no it is nothing said tess then the talk was of business only you can milk em clean my maidy i don t want my cows going azew at this time o year she reassured him on that point and he surveyed her up and down she had been staying indoors a good deal and her complexion had grown delicate quite sure you can stand it tis comfortable enough here for rough folk but we don t live in a cowcumber frame she declared that she could stand it and her zest and willingness seemed to win him over well i suppose you ll want a dish o tay or victuals of some sort hey not yet well do as ye like about it but faith if twas i i should be as dry as a kex wi travelling so far i ll begin milking now to get my hand in said tess she drank a little milk as temporary refreshment to the surprise indeed slight contempt of dairyman crick to whose mind it had apparently never occurred that milk was good as a beverage oh if ye can swaller that be it so he said indifferently while holding up the pail that she sipped from tis what i hain t touched for years not i rot the stuff it would lie in my innerds like lead you can try your hand upon she he pursued nodding to the nearest cow not but what she do milk rather hard we ve hard ones and we ve easy ones like other folks however you ll find out that soon enough when tess had changed her bonnet for a hood and was really on her stool under the cow and the milk was squirting from her fists into the pail she appeared to feel that she really had laid a new foundation for her future the conviction bred serenity her pulse slowed and she was able to look about her the milkers formed quite a little battalion of men and maids the men operating on the hard teated animals the maids on the kindlier natures it was a large dairy there were nearly a hundred milchers under crick s management all told and of the herd the master dairyman milked six or eight with his own hands unless away from home these were the cows that milked hardest of all for his journey milkmen being more or less casually hired he would not entrust this half dozen to their treatment lest from indifference they should not milk them fully nor to the maids lest they should fail in the same way for lack of finger grip with the result that in course of time the cows would go azew that is dry up it was not the loss for the moment that made
TH(Tess...),The lineaments as such seemed to complain They had been diverted from their hereditary connotation to signify impressions for which Nature did not intend them Strange that their very elevation was a misapplication that to raise seemed to falsify Yet could it be so She would admit the ungenerous sentiment no longer dUrberville was not the first wicked man who had turned away from his wickedness to save his soul alive and why should she deem it unnatural in him It was but the usage of thought which had been jarred in her at hearing good new words in bad old notes The greater the sinner the greater the saint it was not necessary to dive far into Christian history to discover that Such impressions as these moved her vaguely and without strict definiteness As soon as the nerveless pause of her surprise would allow her to stir her impulse was to pass on out of his sight He had obviously not discerned her yet in her position against the sun But the moment that she moved again he recognized her The effect upon her old lover was electric far stronger than the effect of his presence upon her His fire the tumultuous ring of his eloquence seemed to go out of him His lip struggled and trembled under the words that lay upon it but deliver them it could not as long as she faced him His eyes after their first glance upon her face hung confusedly in every other direction but hers but came back in a desperate leap every few seconds This paralysis lasted however but a short time for Tess s energies returned with the atrophy of his and she walked as fast as she was able past the barn and onward As soon as she could reflect it appalled her this change in their relative platforms He who had wrought her undoing was now on the side of the Spirit while she remained unregenerate And as in the legend it had resulted that her Cyprian image had suddenly appeared upon his altar whereby the fire of the priest had been well nigh extinguished She went on without turning her head Her back seemed to be endowed with a sensitiveness to ocular beams even her clothing so alive was she to a fancied gaze which might be resting upon her from the outside of that barn All the way along to this point her heart had been heavy with an inactive sorrow now there was a change in the quality of its trouble That hunger for affection too long withheld was for the time displaced by an almost physical sense of an implacable past which still engirdled her It intensified her consciousness of error to a practical despair the break of continuity between her earlier and present existence which she had hoped for had not after all taken place Bygones would never be complete bygones till she was a bygone herself Thus absorbed she recrossed the northern part of Long Ash Lane at right angles and presently saw before her the road ascending whitely to the upland along whose margin the remainder of her journey lay Its dry pale surface stretched severely onward unbroken by a single figure vehicle or mark save some occasional brown horse droppings which dotted its cold aridity here and there While slowly breasting this ascent Tess became conscious of footsteps behind her and turning she saw approaching that well known form so strangely accoutred as the Methodist the one personage in all the world she wished not to encounter alone on this side of the grave There was not much time however for thought or elusion and she yielded as calmly as she could to the necessity of letting him overtake her She saw that he was excited less by the speed of his walk than by the feelings within him Tess he said She slackened speed without looking round Tess he repeated It is I Alec dUrberville She then looked back at him and he came up I see it is she answered coldly Well is that all Yet I deserve no more Of course he added with a slight laugh there is something of the ridiculous to your eyes in seeing me like this But I must put up with that I heard you had gone away nobody knew where Tess you wonder why I have followed you I do rather and I would that you had not with all my heart Yes you may well say it he returned grimly as they moved onward together she with unwilling tread But don t mistake me I beg this because you may have been led to do so in noticing if you did notice it how your sudden appearance unnerved me down there It was but a momentary faltering and considering what you have been to me it was natural enough But will helped me through it though perhaps you think me a humbug for saying it and immediately afterwards I felt that of all persons in the world whom it was my duty and desire to save from the wrath to come sneer if you like the woman whom I had so grievously wronged was that person I have come with that sole purpose in view nothing more There was the smallest vein of scorn in her words of rejoinder Have you saved yourself Charity begins at home they say I have done nothing said he indifferently Heaven as I have been telling my hearers has done all No amount of contempt that you can pour upon me Tess will equal what I have poured upon myself the old Adam of my former years Well it is a strange story believe it or not but I can tell you the means by which my conversion was brought about and I hope you will be interested enough at least to listen Have you ever heard the name of the parson of Emminster you must have done do old Mr Clare one of the most earnest of his school one of the few intense men left in the Church not so intense as the extreme wing of Christian believers with which I have thrown in my lot but quite an exception among the Established clergy the younger of whom are gradually attenuating the true doctrines by their sophistries till they are but the shadow of what they were I only differ from him on the question of Church and State the interpretation of the text Come out from among them and be ye separate saith the Lord that s all He is one who I firmly believe has been the humble means of saving more souls in this country than any other man you can name You have heard of him I have she said He came to Trantridge two or three years ago to preach on behalf of some missionary society and I wretched fellow that I was insulted him when in his disinterestedness he tried to reason with me and show me the way He did not resent my conduct he simply said that some day I should receive the first fruits of the Spirit that those who came to scoff sometimes remained to pray There was a strange magic in his words They sank into my mind But the loss of my mother hit me most and by degrees I was brought to see daylight Since then my one desire has been to hand on the true view to others and that is what I was trying to do to day though it is only lately that I have preached hereabout The first months of my ministry have been spent in the North of England among strangers where I preferred to make my earliest clumsy attempts so as to acquire courage before undergoing that severest of all tests of one s sincerity addressing those who have known one and have been one s companions in the days of darkness If you could only know Tess the pleasure of having a good slap at yourself I am sure Don t go on with it she cried passionately as she turned away from him to a stile by the wayside on which she bent herself I can t believe in such sudden things I feel indignant with you for talking to me like this when you know when you know what harm you ve done me You and those like you take your fill of pleasure on earth by making the life of such as me bitter and black with sorrow and then it is a fine thing when you have had enough of that to think of securing your pleasure in heaven by becoming converted Out upon such I don t believe in you I hate it Tess he insisted don t speak so It came to me like a jolly new idea And you don t believe me What don t you believe Your conversion Your scheme of religion Why She dropped her voice Because a better man than you does not believe in such What a woman s reason Who is this better man I cannot tell you Well he declared a resentment beneath his words seeming ready to spring out at a moment s notice God forbid that I should say I am a good man and you know I don t say any such thing I am new to goodness truly but newcomers see furthest sometimes Yes she replied sadly But I cannot believe in your conversion to a new spirit Such flashes as you feel Alec I fear don t last Thus speaking she turned from the stile over which she had been leaning and faced him whereupon his eyes falling casually upon the familiar countenance and form remained contemplating her The inferior man was quiet in him now but it was surely not extracted nor even entirely subdued Don t look at me like that he said abruptly Tess who had been quite unconscious of her action and mien instantly withdrew the large dark gaze of her eyes stammering with a flush I beg your pardon And there was revived in her the wretched sentiment which had often come to her before that in inhabiting the fleshly tabernacle with which Nature had endowed her she was somehow doing wrong No no Don t beg my pardon But since you wear a veil to hide your good looks why don t you keep it down She pulled down the veil saying hastily It was mostly to keep off the wind It may seem harsh of me to dictate like this he went on but it is better that I should not look too often on you It might be dangerous Ssh said Tess Well women s faces have had too much power over me already for me not to fear them An evangelist has nothing to do with such as they and it reminds me of the old times that I would forget After this their conversation dwindled to a casual remark now and then as they rambled onward Tess inwardly wondering how far he was going with her and not liking to send him back by positive mandate Frequently when they came to a gate or stile they found painted thereon in red or blue letters some text of Scripture and she asked him if he knew who had been at the pains to blazon these announcements He told her that the man was employed by himself and others who were working with him in that district to paint these reminders that no means might be left untried which might move the hearts of a wicked generation At length the road touched the spot called Cross in Hand Of all spots on the bleached and desolate upland this was the most forlorn It was so far removed from the charm which is sought in landscape by artists and view lovers as to reach a new kind of beauty a negative beauty of tragic tone The place took its name from a stone pillar which stood there a strange rude monolith from a stratum unknown in any local quarry on which was roughly carved a human hand Differing accounts were given of its history and purport Some authorities stated that a devotional cross had once formed the complete erection thereon of which the present relic was but the stump others that the stone as it stood was entire and that it had been fixed there to mark a boundary or place of meeting Anyhow whatever the origin of the relic there was and is something sinister or solemn according to mood in the scene amid which it stands something tending to impress the most phlegmatic passer by I think I must leave you now he remarked as they drew near to this spot I have to preach at Abbot s Cernel at six this evening and my way lies across to the right from here And you upset me somewhat too Tessy I cannot will not say why I must go away and get strength How is it that you speak so fluently now Who has taught you such good English I have learnt things in my troubles she said evasively What troubles have you had She told him of the first one the only one that related to him dUrberville was struck mute I knew nothing of this till now he next murmured Why didn t you write to me when you felt your trouble coming on She did not reply and he broke the silence by adding Well you will see me again No she answered Do not again come near me I will think But before we part come here He stepped up to the pillar This was once a Holy Cross Relics are not in my creed but I fear you at moments far more than you need fear me at present and to lessen my fear put your hand upon that stone hand and swear that you will never tempt me by your charms or ways Good God how can you ask what is so unnecessary All that is furthest from my thought Yes but swear it Tess half frightened gave way to his importunity placed her hand upon the stone and swore I am sorry you are not a believer he continued that some unbeliever should have got hold of you and unsettled your mind But no more now At home at least I can pray for you and I will and who knows what may not happen I m off Goodbye He turned to a hunting gate in the hedge and without letting his eyes again rest upon her leapt over and struck out across the down in the direction of Abbot s Cernel As he walked his pace showed perturbation and by and by as if instigated by a former thought he drew from his pocket a small book between the leaves of which was folded a letter worn and soiled as from much re reading dUrberville opened the letter It was dated several months before this time and was signed by Parson Clare The letter began by expressing the writer s unfeigned joy at dUrberville s conversion and thanked him for his kindness in communicating with the parson on the subject It expressed Mr Clare s warm assurance of forgiveness for dUrberville s former conduct and his interest in the young man s plans for the future He Mr Clare would much have liked to see dUrberville in the Church to whose ministry he had devoted so many years of his own life and would have helped him to enter a theological college to that end but since his correspondent had possibly not cared to do this on account of the delay it would have entailed he was not the man to insist upon its paramount importance Every man must work as he could best work and in the method towards which he felt impelled by the Spirit dUrberville read and re read this letter and seemed to quiz himself cynically He also read some passages from memoranda as he walked till his face assumed a calm and apparently the image of Tess no longer troubled his mind She meanwhile had kept along the edge of the hill by which lay her nearest way home Within the distance of a mile she met a solitary shepherd What is the meaning of that old stone I have passed she asked of him Was it ever a Holy Cross Cross no twer not a cross Tis a thing of ill omen Miss It was put up in wuld times by the relations of a malefactor who was tortured there by nailing his hand to a post and afterwards hung The bones lie underneath They say he sold his soul to the devil and that he walks at times She felt the petite mort at this unexpectedly gruesome information and left the solitary man behind her It was dusk when she drew near to Flintcomb Ash and in the lane at the entrance to the hamlet she approached a girl and her lover without their observing her They were talking no secrets and the clear unconcerned voice of the young woman in response to the warmer accents of the man spread into the chilly air as the one soothing thing within the dusky horizon full of a stagnant obscurity upon which nothing else intruded For a moment the voices cheered the heart of Tess till she reasoned that this interview had its origin on one side or the other in the same attraction which had been the prelude to her own tribulation When she came close the girl turned serenely and recognized her the young man walking off in embarrassment The woman was Izz Huett whose interest in Tess s excursion immediately superseded her own proceedings Tess did not explain very clearly its results and Izz who was a girl of tact began to speak of her own little affair a phase of which Tess had just witnessed He is Amby Seedling the chap who used to sometimes come and help at Talbothays she explained indifferently He actually inquired and found out that I had come here and has followed me He says he s been in love wi me these two years But I ve hardly answered him Several days had passed since her futile journey and Tess was afield The dry winter wind still blew but a screen of thatched hurdles erected in the eye of the blast kept its force away from her On the sheltered side was a turnip slicing machine whose bright blue hue of new paint seemed almost vocal in the otherwise subdued scene Opposite its front was a long mound or grave in which the roots had been preserved since early winter Tess was standing at the uncovered end chopping off with a bill hook the fibres and earth from each root and throwing it after the operation into the slicer A man was turning the handle of the machine and from its trough came the newly cut swedes the fresh smell of whose yellow chips was accompanied by the sounds of the snuffling wind the smart swish of the slicing blades and the choppings of the hook in Tess s leather gloved hand The wide acreage of blank agricultural brownness apparent where the swedes had been pulled was beginning to be striped in wales of darker brown gradually broadening to ribands Along the edge of each of these something crept upon ten legs moving without haste and without rest up and down the whole length of the field it was two horses and a man the plough going between them turning up the cleared ground for a spring sowing For hours nothing relieved the joyless monotony of things Then far beyond the ploughing teams a black speck was seen It had come from the corner of a fence where there was a gap and its tendency was up the incline towards the swede cutters From the proportions of a mere point it advanced to the shape of a ninepin and was soon perceived to be a man in black arriving from the direction of Flintcomb Ash The man at the slicer having nothing else to do with his eyes continually observed the comer but Tess who was occupied did not perceive him till her companion directed her attention to his approach It was not her hard taskmaster Farmer Groby it was one in a semi clerical costume who now represented what had once been the free and easy Alec dUrberville Not being hot at his preaching there was less enthusiasm about him now and the presence of the grinder seemed to embarrass him A pale distress was already on Tess s face and she pulled her curtained hood further over it dUrberville came up and said quietly I want to speak to you Tess You have refused my last request not to come near me said she Yes but I have a good reason Well tell it It is more serious than you may think He glanced round to see if he were overheard They were at some distance from the man who turned the slicer and the movement of the machine too sufficiently prevented Alec s words reaching other ears dUrberville placed himself so as to screen Tess from the labourer turning his back to the latter It is this he continued with capricious compunction In thinking of your soul and mine when we last met I neglected to inquire as to your worldly condition You were well dressed and I did not think of it But I see now that it is hard harder than it used to be when I knew you harder than you deserve Perhaps a good deal of it is owning to me She did not answer and he watched her inquiringly as with bent head her face completely screened by the hood she resumed her trimming of the swedes By going on with her work she felt better able to keep him outside her emotions Tess he added with a sigh of discontent yours was the very worst case I ever was concerned in I had no idea of what had resulted till you told me Scamp that I was to foul that innocent life The whole blame was mine the whole unconventional business of our time at Trantridge You too the real blood of which I am but the base imitation what a blind young thing you were as to possibilities I say in all earnestness that it is a shame for parents to bring up their girls in such dangerous ignorance of the gins and nets that the wicked may set for them whether their motive be a good one or the result of simple indifference Tess still did no more than listen throwing down one globular root and taking up another with automatic regularity the pensive contour of the mere fieldwoman alone marking her But it is not that I came to say dUrberville went on My circumstances are these I have lost my mother since you were at Trantridge and the place is my own But I intend to sell it and devote myself to missionary work in Africa A devil of a poor hand I shall make at the trade no doubt However what I want to ask you is will you put it in my power to do my duty to make the only reparation I can make for the trick played you that is will you be my wife and
