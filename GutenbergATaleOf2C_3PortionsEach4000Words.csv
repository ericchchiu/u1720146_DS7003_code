CD(...2Cities),peculiar ear of a place that as mr lorry stood at the open window looking for the father and daughter whose steps he heard he fancied they would never approach not only would the echoes die away as though the steps had gone but echoes of other steps that never came would be heard in their stead and would die away for good when they seemed close at hand however father and daughter did at last appear and miss pross was ready at the street door to receive them miss pross was a pleasant sight albeit wild and red and grim taking off her darling s bonnet when she came up stairs and touching it up with the ends of her handkerchief and blowing the dust off it and folding her mantle ready for laying by and smoothing her rich hair with as much pride as she could possibly have taken in her own hair if she had been the vainest and handsomest of women her darling was a pleasant sight too embracing her and thanking her and protesting against her taking so much trouble for her which last she only dared to do playfully or miss pross sorely hurt would have retired to her own chamber and cried the doctor was a pleasant sight too looking on at them and telling miss pross how she spoilt lucie in accents and with eyes that had as much spoiling in them as miss pross had and would have had more if it were possible mr lorry was a pleasant sight too beaming at all this in his little wig and thanking his bachelor stars for having lighted him in his declining years to a home but no hundreds of people came to see the sights and mr lorry looked in vain for the fulfilment of miss pross s prediction dinner time and still no hundreds of people in the arrangements of the little household miss pross took charge of the lower regions and always acquitted herself marvellously her dinners of a very modest quality were so well cooked and so well served and so neat in their contrivances half english and half french that nothing could be better miss pross s friendship being of the thoroughly practical kind she had ravaged soho and the adjacent provinces in search of impoverished french who tempted by shillings and half crowns would impart culinary mysteries to her from these decayed sons and daughters of gaul she had acquired such wonderful arts that the woman and girl who formed the staff of domestics regarded her as quite a sorceress or cinderella s godmother who would send out for a fowl a rabbit a vegetable or two from the garden and change them into anything she pleased on sundays miss pross dined at the doctor s table but on other days persisted in taking her meals at unknown periods either in the lower regions or in her own room on the second floor a blue chamber to which no one but her ladybird ever gained admittance on this occasion miss pross responding to ladybird s pleasant face and pleasant efforts to please her unbent exceedingly so the dinner was very pleasant too it was an oppressive day and after dinner lucie proposed that the wine should be carried out under the plane tree and they should sit there in the air as everything turned upon her and revolved about her they went out under the plane tree and she carried the wine down for the special benefit of mr lorry she had installed herself some time before as mr lorry s cup bearer and while they sat under the plane tree talking she kept his glass replenished mysterious backs and ends of houses peeped at them as they talked and the plane tree whispered to them in its own way above their heads still the hundreds of people did not present themselves mr darnay presented himself while they were sitting under the plane tree but he was only one doctor manette received him kindly and so did lucie but miss pross suddenly became afflicted with a twitching in the head and body and retired into the house she was not unfrequently the victim of this disorder and she called it in familiar conversation a fit of the jerks the doctor was in his best condition and looked specially young the resemblance between him and lucie was very strong at such times and as they sat side by side she leaning on his shoulder and he resting his arm on the back of her chair it was very agreeable to trace the likeness he had been talking all day on many subjects and with unusual vivacity pray doctor manette said mr darnay as they sat under the plane tree and he said it in the natural pursuit of the topic in hand which happened to be the old buildings of london have you seen much of the tower lucie and i have been there but only casually we have seen enough of it to know that it teems with interest little more i have been there as you remember said darnay with a smile though reddening a little angrily in another character and not in a character that gives facilities for seeing much of it they told me a curious thing when i was there what was that lucie asked in making some alterations the workmen came upon an old dungeon which had been for many years built up and forgotten every stone of its inner wall was covered by inscriptions which had been carved by prisoners dates names complaints and prayers upon a corner stone in an angle of the wall one prisoner who seemed to have gone to execution had cut as his last work three letters they were done with some very poor instrument and hurriedly with an unsteady hand at first they were read as d i c but on being more carefully examined the last letter was found to be g there was no record or legend of any prisoner with those initials and many fruitless guesses were made what the name could have been at length it was suggested that the letters were not initials but the complete word dig the floor was examined very carefully under the inscription and in the earth beneath a stone or tile or some fragment of paving were found the ashes of a paper mingled with the ashes of a small leathern case or bag what the unknown prisoner had written will never be read but he had written something and hidden it away to keep it from the gaoler my father exclaimed lucie you are ill he had suddenly started up with his hand to his head his manner and his look quite terrified them all no my dear not ill there are large drops of rain falling and they made me start we had better go in he recovered himself almost instantly rain was really falling in large drops and he showed the back of his hand with rain drops on it but he said not a single word in reference to the discovery that had been told of and as they went into the house the business eye of mr lorry either detected or fancied it detected on his face as it turned towards charles darnay the same singular look that had been upon it when it turned towards him in the passages of the court house he recovered himself so quickly however that mr lorry had doubts of his business eye the arm of the golden giant in the hall was not more steady than he was when he stopped under it to remark to them that he was not yet proof against slight surprises if he ever would be and that the rain had startled him tea time and miss pross making tea with another fit of the jerks upon her and yet no hundreds of people mr carton had lounged in but he made only two the night was so very sultry that although they sat with doors and windows open they were overpowered by heat when the tea table was done with they all moved to one of the windows and looked out into the heavy twilight lucie sat by her father darnay sat beside her carton leaned against a window the curtains were long and white and some of the thunder gusts that whirled into the corner caught them up to the ceiling and waved them like spectral wings the rain drops are still falling large heavy and few said doctor manette it comes slowly it comes surely said carton they spoke low as people watching and waiting mostly do as people in a dark room watching and waiting for lightning always do there was a great hurry in the streets of people speeding away to get shelter before the storm broke the wonderful corner for echoes resounded with the echoes of footsteps coming and going yet not a footstep was there a multitude of people and yet a solitude said darnay when they had listened for a while is it not impressive mr darnay asked lucie sometimes i have sat here of an evening until i have fancied but even the shade of a foolish fancy makes me shudder to night when all is so black and solemn let us shudder too we may know what it is it will seem nothing to you such whims are only impressive as we originate them i think they are not to be communicated i have sometimes sat alone here of an evening listening until i have made the echoes out to be the echoes of all the footsteps that are coming by and bye into our lives there is a great crowd coming one day into our lives if that be so sydney carton struck in in his moody way the footsteps were incessant and the hurry of them became more and more rapid the corner echoed and re echoed with the tread of feet some as it seemed under the windows some as it seemed in the room some coming some going some breaking off some stopping altogether all in the distant streets and not one within sight are all these footsteps destined to come to all of us miss manette or are we to divide them among us i don t know mr darnay i told you it was a foolish fancy but you asked for it when i have yielded myself to it i have been alone and then i have imagined them the footsteps of the people who are to come into my life and my father s i take them into mine said carton i ask no questions and make no stipulations there is a great crowd bearing down upon us miss manette and i see them by the lightning he added the last words after there had been a vivid flash which had shown him lounging in the window and i hear them he added again after a peal of thunder here they come fast fierce and furious it was the rush and roar of rain that he typified and it stopped him for no voice could be heard in it a memorable storm of thunder and lightning broke with that sweep of water and there was not a moment s interval in crash and fire and rain until after the moon rose at midnight the great bell of saint paul s was striking one in the cleared air when mr lorry escorted by jerry high booted and bearing a lantern set forth on his return passage to clerkenwell there were solitary patches of road on the way between soho and clerkenwell and mr lorry mindful of foot pads always retained jerry for this service though it was usually performed a good two hours earlier what a night it has been almost a night jerry said mr lorry to bring the dead out of their graves i never see the night myself master nor yet i don t expect to what would do that answered jerry good night mr carton said the man of business good night mr darnay shall we ever see such a night again together perhaps perhaps see the great crowd of people with its rush and roar bearing down upon them too monseigneur one of the great lords in power at the court held his fortnightly reception in his grand hotel in paris monseigneur was in his inner room his sanctuary of sanctuaries the holiest of holiests to the crowd of worshippers in the suite of rooms without monseigneur was about to take his chocolate monseigneur could swallow a great many things with ease and was by some few sullen minds supposed to be rather rapidly swallowing france but his morning s chocolate could not so much as get into the throat of monseigneur without the aid of four strong men besides the cook yes it took four men all four ablaze with gorgeous decoration and the chief of them unable to exist with fewer than two gold watches in his pocket emulative of the noble and chaste fashion set by monseigneur to conduct the happy chocolate to monseigneur s lips one lacquey carried the chocolate pot into the sacred presence a second milled and frothed the chocolate with the little instrument he bore for that function a third presented the favoured napkin a fourth he of the two gold watches poured the chocolate out it was impossible for monseigneur to dispense with one of these attendants on the chocolate and hold his high place under the admiring heavens deep would have been the blot upon his escutcheon if his chocolate had been ignobly waited on by only three men he must have died of two monseigneur had been out at a little supper last night where the comedy and the grand opera were charmingly represented monseigneur was out at a little supper most nights with fascinating company so polite and so impressible was monseigneur that the comedy and the grand opera had far more influence with him in the tiresome articles of state affairs and state secrets than the needs of all france a happy circumstance for france as the like always is for all countries similarly favoured always was for england by way of example in the regretted days of the merry stuart who sold it monseigneur had one truly noble idea of general public business which was to let everything go on in its own way of particular public business monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that it must all go his way tend to his own power and pocket of his pleasures general and particular monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that the world was made for them the text of his order altered from the original by only a pronoun which is not much ran the earth and the fulness thereof are mine saith monseigneur yet monseigneur had slowly found that vulgar embarrassments crept into his affairs both private and public and he had as to both classes of affairs allied himself perforce with a farmer general as to finances public because monseigneur could not make anything at all of them and must consequently let them out to somebody who could as to finances private because farmer generals were rich and monseigneur after generations of great luxury and expense was growing poor hence monseigneur had taken his sister from a convent while there was yet time to ward off the impending veil the cheapest garment she could wear and had bestowed her as a prize upon a very rich farmer general poor in family which farmer general carrying an appropriate cane with a golden apple on the top of it was now among the company in the outer rooms much prostrated before by mankind always excepting superior mankind of the blood of monseigneur who his own wife included looked down upon him with the loftiest contempt a sumptuous man was the farmer general thirty horses stood in his stables twenty four male domestics sat in his halls six body women waited on his wife as one who pretended to do nothing but plunder and forage where he could the farmer general howsoever his matrimonial relations conduced to social morality was at least the greatest reality among the personages who attended at the hotel of monseigneur that day for the rooms though a beautiful scene to look at and adorned with every device of decoration that the taste and skill of the time could achieve were in truth not a sound business considered with any reference to the scarecrows in the rags and nightcaps elsewhere and not so far off either but that the watching towers of notre dame almost equidistant from the two extremes could see them both they would have been an exceedingly uncomfortable business if that could have been anybody s business at the house of monseigneur military officers destitute of military knowledge naval officers with no idea of a ship civil officers without a notion of affairs brazen ecclesiastics of the worst world worldly with sensual eyes loose tongues and looser lives all totally unfit for their several callings all lying horribly in pretending to belong to them but all nearly or remotely of the order of monseigneur and therefore foisted on all public employments from which anything was to be got these were to be told off by the score and the score people not immediately connected with monseigneur or the state yet equally unconnected with anything that was real or with lives passed in travelling by any straight road to any true earthly end were no less abundant doctors who made great fortunes out of dainty remedies for imaginary disorders that never existed smiled upon their courtly patients in the ante chambers of monseigneur projectors who had discovered every kind of remedy for the little evils with which the state was touched except the remedy of setting to work in earnest to root out a single sin poured their distracting babble into any ears they could lay hold of at the reception of monseigneur unbelieving philosophers who were remodelling the world with words and making card towers of babel to scale the skies with talked with unbelieving chemists who had an eye on the transmutation of metals at this wonderful gathering accumulated by monseigneur exquisite gentlemen of the finest breeding which was at that remarkable time and has been since to be known by its fruits of indifference to every natural subject of human interest were in the most exemplary state of exhaustion at the hotel of monseigneur such homes had these various notabilities left behind them in the fine world of paris that the spies among the assembled devotees of monseigneur forming a goodly half of the polite company would have found it hard to discover among the angels of that sphere one solitary wife who in her manners and appearance owned to being a mother indeed except for the mere act of bringing a troublesome creature into this world which does not go far towards the realisation of the name of mother there was no such thing known to the fashion peasant women kept the unfashionable babies close and brought them up and charming grandmammas of sixty dressed and supped as at twenty the leprosy of unreality disfigured every human creature in attendance upon monseigneur in the outermost room were half a dozen exceptional people who had had for a few years some vague misgiving in them that things in general were going rather wrong as a promising way of setting them right half of the half dozen had become members of a fantastic sect of convulsionists and were even then considering within themselves whether they should foam rage roar and turn cataleptic on the spot thereby setting up a highly intelligible finger post to the future for monseigneur s guidance besides these dervishes were other three who had rushed into another sect which mended matters with a jargon about the centre of truth holding that man had got out of the centre of truth which did not need much demonstration but had not got out of the circumference and that he was to be kept from flying out of the circumference and was even to be shoved back into the centre by fasting and seeing of spirits among these accordingly much discoursing with spirits went on and it did a world of good which never became manifest but the comfort was that all the company at the grand hotel of monseigneur were perfectly dressed if the day of judgment had only been ascertained to be a dress day everybody there would have been eternally correct such frizzling and powdering and sticking up of hair such delicate complexions artificially preserved and mended such gallant swords to look at and such delicate honour to the sense of smell would surely keep anything going for ever and ever the exquisite gentlemen of the finest breeding wore little pendent trinkets that chinked as they languidly moved these golden fetters rang like precious little bells and what with that ringing and with the rustle of silk and brocade and fine linen there was a flutter in the air that fanned saint antoine and his devouring hunger far away dress was the one unfailing talisman and charm used for keeping all things in their places everybody was dressed for a fancy ball that was never to leave off from the palace of the tuileries through monseigneur and the whole court through the chambers the tribunals of justice and all society except the scarecrows the fancy ball descended to the common executioner who in pursuance of the charm was required to officiate frizzled powdered in a gold laced coat pumps and white silk stockings at the gallows and the wheel the axe was a rarity monsieur paris as it was the episcopal mode among his brother professors of the provinces monsieur orleans and the rest to call him presided in this dainty dress and who among the company at monseigneur s reception in that seventeen hundred and eightieth year of our lord could possibly doubt that a system rooted in a frizzled hangman powdered gold laced pumped and white silk stockinged would see the very stars out monseigneur having eased his four men of their burdens and taken his chocolate caused the doors of the holiest of holiests to be thrown open and issued forth then what submission what cringing and fawning what servility what abject humiliation as to bowing down in body and spirit nothing in that way was left for heaven which may have been one among other reasons why the worshippers of monseigneur never troubled it bestowing a word of promise here and a smile there a whisper on one happy slave and a wave of the hand on another monseigneur affably passed through his rooms to the remote region of the circumference of truth there monseigneur turned and came back again and so in due course of time got himself shut up in his sanctuary by the chocolate sprites and was seen no more the show being over the flutter in the air became quite a little storm and the precious little bells went ringing downstairs there was soon but one person left of all the crowd and he with his hat under his arm and his snuff box in his hand slowly passed among the mirrors on his way out i devote you said this person stopping at the last door on his way and turning in the direction of the sanctuary to the devil with that he shook the snuff from his fingers as if he had shaken the dust from his feet and quietly walked downstairs he was a man of about sixty
CD(...2Cities),group when it was done some diamonds very bright and sparkling glanced on the bride s hand which were newly released from the dark obscurity of one of mr lorry s pockets they returned home to breakfast and all went well and in due course the golden hair that had mingled with the poor shoemaker s white locks in the paris garret were mingled with them again in the morning sunlight on the threshold of the door at parting it was a hard parting though it was not for long but her father cheered her and said at last gently disengaging himself from her enfolding arms take her charles she is yours and her agitated hand waved to them from a chaise window and she was gone the corner being out of the way of the idle and curious and the preparations having been very simple and few the doctor mr lorry and miss pross were left quite alone it was when they turned into the welcome shade of the cool old hall that mr lorry observed a great change to have come over the doctor as if the golden arm uplifted there had struck him a poisoned blow he had naturally repressed much and some revulsion might have been expected in him when the occasion for repression was gone but it was the old scared lost look that troubled mr lorry and through his absent manner of clasping his head and drearily wandering away into his own room when they got up stairs mr lorry was reminded of defarge the wine shop keeper and the starlight ride i think he whispered to miss pross after anxious consideration i think we had best not speak to him just now or at all disturb him i must look in at tellson s so i will go there at once and come back presently then we will take him a ride into the country and dine there and all will be well it was easier for mr lorry to look in at tellson s than to look out of tellson s he was detained two hours when he came back he ascended the old staircase alone having asked no question of the servant going thus into the doctor s rooms he was stopped by a low sound of knocking good god he said with a start what s that miss pross with a terrified face was at his ear o me o me all is lost cried she wringing her hands what is to be told to ladybird he doesn t know me and is making shoes mr lorry said what he could to calm her and went himself into the doctor s room the bench was turned towards the light as it had been when he had seen the shoemaker at his work before and his head was bent down and he was very busy doctor manette my dear friend doctor manette the doctor looked at him for a moment half inquiringly half as if he were angry at being spoken to and bent over his work again he had laid aside his coat and waistcoat his shirt was open at the throat as it used to be when he did that work and even the old haggard faded surface of face had come back to him he worked hard impatiently as if in some sense of having been interrupted mr lorry glanced at the work in his hand and observed that it was a shoe of the old size and shape he took up another that was lying by him and asked what it was a young lady s walking shoe he muttered without looking up it ought to have been finished long ago let it be but doctor manette look at me he obeyed in the old mechanically submissive manner without pausing in his work you know me my dear friend think again this is not your proper occupation think dear friend nothing would induce him to speak more he looked up for an instant at a time when he was requested to do so but no persuasion would extract a word from him he worked and worked and worked in silence and words fell on him as they would have fallen on an echoless wall or on the air the only ray of hope that mr lorry could discover was that he sometimes furtively looked up without being asked in that there seemed a faint expression of curiosity or perplexity as though he were trying to reconcile some doubts in his mind two things at once impressed themselves on mr lorry as important above all others the first that this must be kept secret from lucie the second that it must be kept secret from all who knew him in conjunction with miss pross he took immediate steps towards the latter precaution by giving out that the doctor was not well and required a few days of complete rest in aid of the kind deception to be practised on his daughter miss pross was to write describing his having been called away professionally and referring to an imaginary letter of two or three hurried lines in his own hand represented to have been addressed to her by the same post these measures advisable to be taken in any case mr lorry took in the hope of his coming to himself if that should happen soon he kept another course in reserve which was to have a certain opinion that he thought the best on the doctor s case in the hope of his recovery and of resort to this third course being thereby rendered practicable mr lorry resolved to watch him attentively with as little appearance as possible of doing so he therefore made arrangements to absent himself from tellson s for the first time in his life and took his post by the window in the same room he was not long in discovering that it was worse than useless to speak to him since on being pressed he became worried he abandoned that attempt on the first day and resolved merely to keep himself always before him as a silent protest against the delusion into which he had fallen or was falling he remained therefore in his seat near the window reading and writing and expressing in as many pleasant and natural ways as he could think of that it was a free place doctor manette took what was given him to eat and drink and worked on that first day until it was too dark to see worked on half an hour after mr lorry could not have seen for his life to read or write when he put his tools aside as useless until morning mr lorry rose and said to him will you go out he looked down at the floor on either side of him in the old manner looked up in the old manner and repeated in the old low voice out yes for a walk with me why not he made no effort to say why not and said not a word more but mr lorry thought he saw as he leaned forward on his bench in the dusk with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands that he was in some misty way asking himself why not the sagacity of the man of business perceived an advantage here and determined to hold it miss pross and he divided the night into two watches and observed him at intervals from the adjoining room he paced up and down for a long time before he lay down but when he did finally lay himself down he fell asleep in the morning he was up betimes and went straight to his bench and to work on this second day mr lorry saluted him cheerfully by his name and spoke to him on topics that had been of late familiar to them he returned no reply but it was evident that he heard what was said and that he thought about it however confusedly this encouraged mr lorry to have miss pross in with her work several times during the day at those times they quietly spoke of lucie and of her father then present precisely in the usual manner and as if there were nothing amiss this was done without any demonstrative accompaniment not long enough or often enough to harass him and it lightened mr lorry s friendly heart to believe that he looked up oftener and that he appeared to be stirred by some perception of inconsistencies surrounding him when it fell dark again mr lorry asked him as before dear doctor will you go out as before he repeated out yes for a walk with me why not this time mr lorry feigned to go out when he could extract no answer from him and after remaining absent for an hour returned in the meanwhile the doctor had removed to the seat in the window and had sat there looking down at the plane tree but on mr lorry s return he slipped away to his bench the time went very slowly on and mr lorry s hope darkened and his heart grew heavier again and grew yet heavier and heavier every day the third day came and went the fourth the fifth five days six days seven days eight days nine days with a hope ever darkening and with a heart always growing heavier and heavier mr lorry passed through this anxious time the secret was well kept and lucie was unconscious and happy but he could not fail to observe that the shoemaker whose hand had been a little out at first was growing dreadfully skilful and that he had never been so intent on his work and that his hands had never been so nimble and expert as in the dusk of the ninth evening worn out by anxious watching mr lorry fell asleep at his post on the tenth morning of his suspense he was startled by the shining of the sun into the room where a heavy slumber had overtaken him when it was dark night he rubbed his eyes and roused himself but he doubted when he had done so whether he was not still asleep for going to the door of the doctor s room and looking in he perceived that the shoemaker s bench and tools were put aside again and that the doctor himself sat reading at the window he was in his usual morning dress and his face which mr lorry could distinctly see though still very pale was calmly studious and attentive even when he had satisfied himself that he was awake mr lorry felt giddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking might not be a disturbed dream of his own for did not his eyes show him his friend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect and employed as usual and was there any sign within their range that the change of which he had so strong an impression had actually happened it was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment the answer being obvious if the impression were not produced by a real corresponding and sufficient cause how came he jarvis lorry there how came he to have fallen asleep in his clothes on the sofa in doctor manette s consulting room and to be debating these points outside the doctor s bedroom door in the early morning within a few minutes miss pross stood whispering at his side if he had had any particle of doubt left her talk would of necessity have resolved it but he was by that time clear headed and had none he advised that they should let the time go by until the regular breakfast hour and should then meet the doctor as if nothing unusual had occurred if he appeared to be in his customary state of mind mr lorry would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from the opinion he had been in his anxiety so anxious to obtain miss pross submitting herself to his judgment the scheme was worked out with care having abundance of time for his usual methodical toilette mr lorry presented himself at the breakfast hour in his usual white linen and with his usual neat leg the doctor was summoned in the usual way and came to breakfast so far as it was possible to comprehend him without overstepping those delicate and gradual approaches which mr lorry felt to be the only safe advance he at first supposed that his daughter s marriage had taken place yesterday an incidental allusion purposely thrown out to the day of the week and the day of the month set him thinking and counting and evidently made him uneasy in all other respects however he was so composedly himself that mr lorry determined to have the aid he sought and that aid was his own therefore when the breakfast was done and cleared away and he and the doctor were left together mr lorry said feelingly my dear manette i am anxious to have your opinion in confidence on a very curious case in which i am deeply interested that is to say it is very curious to me perhaps to your better information it may be less so glancing at his hands which were discoloured by his late work the doctor looked troubled and listened attentively he had already glanced at his hands more than once doctor manette said mr lorry touching him affectionately on the arm the case is the case of a particularly dear friend of mine pray give your mind to it and advise me well for his sake and above all for his daughter s his daughter s my dear manette if i understand said the doctor in a subdued tone some mental shock yes be explicit said the doctor spare no detail mr lorry saw that they understood one another and proceeded my dear manette it is the case of an old and a prolonged shock of great acuteness and severity to the affections the feelings the the as you express it the mind the mind it is the case of a shock under which the sufferer was borne down one cannot say for how long because i believe he cannot calculate the time himself and there are no other means of getting at it it is the case of a shock from which the sufferer recovered by a process that he cannot trace himself as i once heard him publicly relate in a striking manner it is the case of a shock from which he has recovered so completely as to be a highly intelligent man capable of close application of mind and great exertion of body and of constantly making fresh additions to his stock of knowledge which was already very large but unfortunately there has been he paused and took a deep breath a slight relapse the doctor in a low voice asked of how long duration nine days and nights how did it show itself i infer glancing at his hands again in the resumption of some old pursuit connected with the shock that is the fact now did you ever see him asked the doctor distinctly and collectedly though in the same low voice engaged in that pursuit originally once and when the relapse fell on him was he in most respects or in all respects as he was then i think in all respects you spoke of his daughter does his daughter know of the relapse no it has been kept from her and i hope will always be kept from her it is known only to myself and to one other who may be trusted the doctor grasped his hand and murmured that was very kind that was very thoughtful mr lorry grasped his hand in return and neither of the two spoke for a little while now my dear manette said mr lorry at length in his most considerate and most affectionate way i am a mere man of business and unfit to cope with such intricate and difficult matters i do not possess the kind of information necessary i do not possess the kind of intelligence i want guiding there is no man in this world on whom i could so rely for right guidance as on you tell me how does this relapse come about is there danger of another could a repetition of it be prevented how should a repetition of it be treated how does it come about at all what can i do for my friend no man ever can have been more desirous in his heart to serve a friend than i am to serve mine if i knew how but i don t know how to originate in such a case if your sagacity knowledge and experience could put me on the right track i might be able to do so much unenlightened and undirected i can do so little pray discuss it with me pray enable me to see it a little more clearly and teach me how to be a little more useful doctor manette sat meditating after these earnest words were spoken and mr lorry did not press him i think it probable said the doctor breaking silence with an effort that the relapse you have described my dear friend was not quite unforeseen by its subject was it dreaded by him mr lorry ventured to ask very much he said it with an involuntary shudder you have no idea how such an apprehension weighs on the sufferer s mind and how difficult how almost impossible it is for him to force himself to utter a word upon the topic that oppresses him would he asked mr lorry be sensibly relieved if he could prevail upon himself to impart that secret brooding to any one when it is on him i think so but it is as i have told you next to impossible i even believe it in some cases to be quite impossible now said mr lorry gently laying his hand on the doctor s arm again after a short silence on both sides to what would you refer this attack i believe returned doctor manette that there had been a strong and extraordinary revival of the train of thought and remembrance that was the first cause of the malady some intense associations of a most distressing nature were vividly recalled i think it is probable that there had long been a dread lurking in his mind that those associations would be recalled say under certain circumstances say on a particular occasion he tried to prepare himself in vain perhaps the effort to prepare himself made him less able to bear it would he remember what took place in the relapse asked mr lorry with natural hesitation the doctor looked desolately round the room shook his head and answered in a low voice not at all now as to the future hinted mr lorry as to the future said the doctor recovering firmness i should have great hope as it pleased heaven in its mercy to restore him so soon i should have great hope he yielding under the pressure of a complicated something long dreaded and long vaguely foreseen and contended against and recovering after the cloud had burst and passed i should hope that the worst was over well well that s good comfort i am thankful said mr lorry i am thankful repeated the doctor bending his head with reverence there are two other points said mr lorry on which i am anxious to be instructed i may go on you cannot do your friend a better service the doctor gave him his hand to the first then he is of a studious habit and unusually energetic he applies himself with great ardour to the acquisition of professional knowledge to the conducting of experiments to many things now does he do too much i think not it may be the character of his mind to be always in singular need of occupation that may be in part natural to it in part the result of affliction the less it was occupied with healthy things the more it would be in danger of turning in the unhealthy direction he may have observed himself and made the discovery you are sure that he is not under too great a strain i think i am quite sure of it my dear manette if he were overworked now my dear lorry i doubt if that could easily be there has been a violent stress in one direction and it needs a counterweight excuse me as a persistent man of business assuming for a moment that he was overworked it would show itself in some renewal of this disorder i do not think so i do not think said doctor manette with the firmness of self conviction that anything but the one train of association would renew it i think that henceforth nothing but some extraordinary jarring of that chord could renew it after what has happened and after his recovery i find it difficult to imagine any such violent sounding of that string again i trust and i almost believe that the circumstances likely to renew it are exhausted he spoke with the diffidence of a man who knew how slight a thing would overset the delicate organisation of the mind and yet with the confidence of a man who had slowly won his assurance out of personal endurance and distress it was not for his friend to abate that confidence he professed himself more relieved and encouraged than he really was and approached his second and last point he felt it to be the most difficult of all but remembering his old sunday morning conversation with miss pross and remembering what he had seen in the last nine days he knew that he must face it the occupation resumed under the influence of this passing affliction so happily recovered from said mr lorry clearing his throat we will call blacksmith s work blacksmith s work we will say to put a case and for the sake of illustration that he had been used in his bad time to work at a little forge we will say that he was unexpectedly found at his forge again is it not a pity that he should keep it by him the doctor shaded his forehead with his hand and beat his foot nervously on the ground he has always kept it by him said mr lorry with an anxious look at his friend now would it not be better that he should let it go still the doctor with shaded forehead beat his foot nervously on the ground you do not find it easy to advise me said mr lorry i quite understand it to be a nice question and yet i think and there he shook his head and stopped you see said doctor manette turning to him after an uneasy pause it is very hard to explain consistently the innermost workings of this poor man s mind he once yearned so frightfully for that occupation and it was so welcome when it came no doubt it relieved his pain so much by substituting the perplexity of the fingers for the perplexity of the brain and by substituting as he became more practised the ingenuity of the hands for the ingenuity of the mental torture that he has never been able to bear the thought of putting it quite out of his reach even now when i believe he is more hopeful of himself than he has ever been and even speaks of himself with a kind of confidence the idea
CD(...2Cities),and stifled by the bunches of grass and straw that were thrust into his face by hundreds of hands torn bruised panting bleeding yet always entreating and beseeching for mercy now full of vehement agony of action with a small clear space about him as the people drew one another back that they might see now a log of dead wood drawn through a forest of legs he was hauled to the nearest street corner where one of the fatal lamps swung and there madame defarge let him go as a cat might have done to a mouse and silently and composedly looked at him while they made ready and while he besought her the women passionately screeching at him all the time and the men sternly calling out to have him killed with grass in his mouth once he went aloft and the rope broke and they caught him shrieking twice he went aloft and the rope broke and they caught him shrieking then the rope was merciful and held him and his head was soon upon a pike with grass enough in the mouth for all saint antoine to dance at the sight of nor was this the end of the day s bad work for saint antoine so shouted and danced his angry blood up that it boiled again on hearing when the day closed in that the son in law of the despatched another of the people s enemies and insulters was coming into paris under a guard five hundred strong in cavalry alone saint antoine wrote his crimes on flaring sheets of paper seized him would have torn him out of the breast of an army to bear foulon company set his head and heart on pikes and carried the three spoils of the day in wolf procession through the streets not before dark night did the men and women come back to the children wailing and breadless then the miserable bakers shops were beset by long files of them patiently waiting to buy bad bread and while they waited with stomachs faint and empty they beguiled the time by embracing one another on the triumphs of the day and achieving them again in gossip gradually these strings of ragged people shortened and frayed away and then poor lights began to shine in high windows and slender fires were made in the streets at which neighbours cooked in common afterwards supping at their doors scanty and insufficient suppers those and innocent of meat as of most other sauce to wretched bread yet human fellowship infused some nourishment into the flinty viands and struck some sparks of cheerfulness out of them fathers and mothers who had had their full share in the worst of the day played gently with their meagre children and lovers with such a world around them and before them loved and hoped it was almost morning when defarge s wine shop parted with its last knot of customers and monsieur defarge said to madame his wife in husky tones while fastening the door at last it is come my dear eh well returned madame almost saint antoine slept the defarges slept even the vengeance slept with her starved grocer and the drum was at rest the drum s was the only voice in saint antoine that blood and hurry had not changed the vengeance as custodian of the drum could have wakened him up and had the same speech out of him as before the bastille fell or old foulon was seized not so with the hoarse tones of the men and women in saint antoine s bosom there was a change on the village where the fountain fell and where the mender of roads went forth daily to hammer out of the stones on the highway such morsels of bread as might serve for patches to hold his poor ignorant soul and his poor reduced body together the prison on the crag was not so dominant as of yore there were soldiers to guard it but not many there were officers to guard the soldiers but not one of them knew what his men would do beyond this that it would probably not be what he was ordered far and wide lay a ruined country yielding nothing but desolation every green leaf every blade of grass and blade of grain was as shrivelled and poor as the miserable people everything was bowed down dejected oppressed and broken habitations fences domesticated animals men women children and the soil that bore them all worn out monseigneur often a most worthy individual gentleman was a national blessing gave a chivalrous tone to things was a polite example of luxurious and shining life and a great deal more to equal purpose nevertheless monseigneur as a class had somehow or other brought things to this strange that creation designed expressly for monseigneur should be so soon wrung dry and squeezed out there must be something short sighted in the eternal arrangements surely thus it was however and the last drop of blood having been extracted from the flints and the last screw of the rack having been turned so often that its purchase crumbled and it now turned and turned with nothing to bite monseigneur began to run away from a phenomenon so low and unaccountable but this was not the change on the village and on many a village like it for scores of years gone by monseigneur had squeezed it and wrung it and had seldom graced it with his presence except for the pleasures of the chase now found in hunting the people now found in hunting the beasts for whose preservation monseigneur made edifying spaces of barbarous and barren wilderness no the change consisted in the appearance of strange faces of low caste rather than in the disappearance of the high caste chiselled and otherwise beautified and beautifying features of monseigneur for in these times as the mender of roads worked solitary in the dust not often troubling himself to reflect that dust he was and to dust he must return being for the most part too much occupied in thinking how little he had for supper and how much more he would eat if he had it in these times as he raised his eyes from his lonely labour and viewed the prospect he would see some rough figure approaching on foot the like of which was once a rarity in those parts but was now a frequent presence as it advanced the mender of roads would discern without surprise that it was a shaggy haired man of almost barbarian aspect tall in wooden shoes that were clumsy even to the eyes of a mender of roads grim rough swart steeped in the mud and dust of many highways dank with the marshy moisture of many low grounds sprinkled with the thorns and leaves and moss of many byways through woods such a man came upon him like a ghost at noon in the july weather as he sat on his heap of stones under a bank taking such shelter as he could get from a shower of hail the man looked at him looked at the village in the hollow at the mill and at the prison on the crag when he had identified these objects in what benighted mind he had he said in a dialect that was just intelligible how goes it jacques all well jacques touch then they joined hands and the man sat down on the heap of stones no dinner nothing but supper now said the mender of roads with a hungry face it is the fashion growled the man i meet no dinner anywhere he took out a blackened pipe filled it lighted it with flint and steel pulled at it until it was in a bright glow then suddenly held it from him and dropped something into it from between his finger and thumb that blazed and went out in a puff of smoke touch then it was the turn of the mender of roads to say it this time after observing these operations they again joined hands to night said the mender of roads to night said the man putting the pipe in his mouth where here he and the mender of roads sat on the heap of stones looking silently at one another with the hail driving in between them like a pigmy charge of bayonets until the sky began to clear over the village show me said the traveller then moving to the brow of the hill see returned the mender of roads with extended finger you go down here and straight through the street and past the fountain to the devil with all that interrupted the other rolling his eye over the landscape i go through no streets and past no fountains well well about two leagues beyond the summit of that hill above the village good when do you cease to work at sunset will you wake me before departing i have walked two nights without resting let me finish my pipe and i shall sleep like a child will you wake me surely the wayfarer smoked his pipe out put it in his breast slipped off his great wooden shoes and lay down on his back on the heap of stones he was fast asleep directly as the road mender plied his dusty labour and the hail clouds rolling away revealed bright bars and streaks of sky which were responded to by silver gleams upon the landscape the little man who wore a red cap now in place of his blue one seemed fascinated by the figure on the heap of stones his eyes were so often turned towards it that he used his tools mechanically and one would have said to very poor account the bronze face the shaggy black hair and beard the coarse woollen red cap the rough medley dress of home spun stuff and hairy skins of beasts the powerful frame attenuated by spare living and the sullen and desperate compression of the lips in sleep inspired the mender of roads with awe the traveller had travelled far and his feet were footsore and his ankles chafed and bleeding his great shoes stuffed with leaves and grass had been heavy to drag over the many long leagues and his clothes were chafed into holes as he himself was into sores stooping down beside him the road mender tried to get a peep at secret weapons in his breast or where not but in vain for he slept with his arms crossed upon him and set as resolutely as his lips fortified towns with their stockades guard houses gates trenches and drawbridges seemed to the mender of roads to be so much air as against this figure and when he lifted his eyes from it to the horizon and looked around he saw in his small fancy similar figures stopped by no obstacle tending to centres all over france the man slept on indifferent to showers of hail and intervals of brightness to sunshine on his face and shadow to the paltering lumps of dull ice on his body and the diamonds into which the sun changed them until the sun was low in the west and the sky was glowing then the mender of roads having got his tools together and all things ready to go down into the village roused him good said the sleeper rising on his elbow two leagues beyond the summit of the hill about about good the mender of roads went home with the dust going on before him according to the set of the wind and was soon at the fountain squeezing himself in among the lean kine brought there to drink and appearing even to whisper to them in his whispering to all the village when the village had taken its poor supper it did not creep to bed as it usually did but came out of doors again and remained there a curious contagion of whispering was upon it and also when it gathered together at the fountain in the dark another curious contagion of looking expectantly at the sky in one direction only monsieur gabelle chief functionary of the place became uneasy went out on his house top alone and looked in that direction too glanced down from behind his chimneys at the darkening faces by the fountain below and sent word to the sacristan who kept the keys of the church that there might be need to ring the tocsin by and bye the night deepened the trees environing the old chateau keeping its solitary state apart moved in a rising wind as though they threatened the pile of building massive and dark in the gloom up the two terrace flights of steps the rain ran wildly and beat at the great door like a swift messenger rousing those within uneasy rushes of wind went through the hall among the old spears and knives and passed lamenting up the stairs and shook the curtains of the bed where the last marquis had slept east west north and south through the woods four heavy treading unkempt figures crushed the high grass and cracked the branches striding on cautiously to come together in the courtyard four lights broke out there and moved away in different directions and all was black again but not for long presently the chateau began to make itself strangely visible by some light of its own as though it were growing luminous then a flickering streak played behind the architecture of the front picking out transparent places and showing where balustrades arches and windows were then it soared higher and grew broader and brighter soon from a score of the great windows flames burst forth and the stone faces awakened stared out of fire a faint murmur arose about the house from the few people who were left there and there was a saddling of a horse and riding away there was spurring and splashing through the darkness and bridle was drawn in the space by the village fountain and the horse in a foam stood at monsieur gabelle s door help gabelle help every one the tocsin rang impatiently but other help if that were any there was none the mender of roads and two hundred and fifty particular friends stood with folded arms at the fountain looking at the pillar of fire in the sky it must be forty feet high said they grimly and never moved the rider from the chateau and the horse in a foam clattered away through the village and galloped up the stony steep to the prison on the crag at the gate a group of officers were looking at the fire removed from them a group of soldiers help gentlemen officers the chateau is on fire valuable objects may be saved from the flames by timely aid help help the officers looked towards the soldiers who looked at the fire gave no orders and answered with shrugs and biting of lips it must burn as the rider rattled down the hill again and through the street the village was illuminating the mender of roads and the two hundred and fifty particular friends inspired as one man and woman by the idea of lighting up had darted into their houses and were putting candles in every dull little pane of glass the general scarcity of everything occasioned candles to be borrowed in a rather peremptory manner of monsieur gabelle and in a moment of reluctance and hesitation on that functionary s part the mender of roads once so submissive to authority had remarked that carriages were good to make bonfires with and that post horses would roast the chateau was left to itself to flame and burn in the roaring and raging of the conflagration a red hot wind driving straight from the infernal regions seemed to be blowing the edifice away with the rising and falling of the blaze the stone faces showed as if they were in torment when great masses of stone and timber fell the face with the two dints in the nose became obscured anon struggled out of the smoke again as if it were the face of the cruel marquis burning at the stake and contending with the fire the chateau burned the nearest trees laid hold of by the fire scorched and shrivelled trees at a distance fired by the four fierce figures begirt the blazing edifice with a new forest of smoke molten lead and iron boiled in the marble basin of the fountain the water ran dry the extinguisher tops of the towers vanished like ice before the heat and trickled down into four rugged wells of flame great rents and splits branched out in the solid walls like crystallisation stupefied birds wheeled about and dropped into the furnace four fierce figures trudged away east west north and south along the night enshrouded roads guided by the beacon they had lighted towards their next destination the illuminated village had seized hold of the tocsin and abolishing the lawful ringer rang for joy not only that but the village light headed with famine fire and bell ringing and bethinking itself that monsieur gabelle had to do with the collection of rent and taxes though it was but a small instalment of taxes and no rent at all that gabelle had got in those latter days became impatient for an interview with him and surrounding his house summoned him to come forth for personal conference whereupon monsieur gabelle did heavily bar his door and retire to hold counsel with himself the result of that conference was that gabelle again withdrew himself to his housetop behind his stack of chimneys this time resolved if his door were broken in he was a small southern man of retaliative temperament to pitch himself head foremost over the parapet and crush a man or two below probably monsieur gabelle passed a long night up there with the distant chateau for fire and candle and the beating at his door combined with the joy ringing for music not to mention his having an ill omened lamp slung across the road before his posting house gate which the village showed a lively inclination to displace in his favour a trying suspense to be passing a whole summer night on the brink of the black ocean ready to take that plunge into it upon which monsieur gabelle had resolved but the friendly dawn appearing at last and the rush candles of the village guttering out the people happily dispersed and monsieur gabelle came down bringing his life with him for that while within a hundred miles and in the light of other fires there were other functionaries less fortunate that night and other nights whom the rising sun found hanging across once peaceful streets where they had been born and bred also there were other villagers and townspeople less fortunate than the mender of roads and his fellows upon whom the functionaries and soldiery turned with success and whom they strung up in their turn but the fierce figures were steadily wending east west north and south be that as it would and whosoever hung fire burned the altitude of the gallows that would turn to water and quench it no functionary by any stretch of mathematics was able to calculate successfully in such risings of fire and risings of sea the firm earth shaken by the rushes of an angry ocean which had now no ebb but was always on the flow higher and higher to the terror and wonder of the beholders on the shore three years of tempest were consumed three more birthdays of little lucie had been woven by the golden thread into the peaceful tissue of the life of her home many a night and many a day had its inmates listened to the echoes in the corner with hearts that failed them when they heard the thronging feet for the footsteps had become to their minds as the footsteps of a people tumultuous under a red flag and with their country declared in danger changed into wild beasts by terrible enchantment long persisted in monseigneur as a class had dissociated himself from the phenomenon of his not being appreciated of his being so little wanted in france as to incur considerable danger of receiving his dismissal from it and this life together like the fabled rustic who raised the devil with infinite pains and was so terrified at the sight of him that he could ask the enemy no question but immediately fled so monseigneur after boldly reading the lord s prayer backwards for a great number of years and performing many other potent spells for compelling the evil one no sooner beheld him in his terrors than he took to his noble heels the shining bull s eye of the court was gone or it would have been the mark for a hurricane of national bullets it had never been a good eye to see with had long had the mote in it of lucifer s pride sardanapalus s luxury and a mole s blindness but it had dropped out and was gone the court from that exclusive inner circle to its outermost rotten ring of intrigue corruption and dissimulation was all gone together royalty was gone had been besieged in its palace and suspended when the last tidings came over the august of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety two was come and monseigneur was by this time scattered far and wide as was natural the head quarters and great gathering place of monseigneur in london was tellson s bank spirits are supposed to haunt the places where their bodies most resorted and monseigneur without a guinea haunted the spot where his guineas used to be moreover it was the spot to which such french intelligence as was most to be relied upon came quickest again tellson s was a munificent house and extended great liberality to old customers who had fallen from their high estate again those nobles who had seen the coming storm in time and anticipating plunder or confiscation had made provident remittances to tellson s were always to be heard of there by their needy brethren to which it must be added that every new comer from france reported himself and his tidings at tellson s almost as a matter of course for such variety of reasons tellson s was at that time as to french intelligence a kind of high exchange and this was so well known to the public and the inquiries made there were in consequence so numerous that tellson s sometimes wrote the latest news out in a line or so and posted it in the bank windows for all who ran through temple bar to read on a steaming misty afternoon mr lorry sat at his desk and charles darnay stood leaning on it talking with him in a low voice the penitential den once set apart for interviews with the house was now the news exchange and was filled to overflowing it was within half an hour or so of the time of closing but although you are the youngest man that ever lived said charles darnay rather hesitating i must still suggest to you i understand that i am too old said mr lorry unsettled weather a long journey uncertain means of travelling a disorganised country a city that may not be even safe for you my dear charles said mr lorry with cheerful confidence you touch some of the reasons for my going not for my staying away it is safe enough for me nobody will care to interfere with an old fellow of hard upon fourscore when there are so many
