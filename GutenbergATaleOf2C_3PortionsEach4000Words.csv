1,peculiar ear of a place that as stood at the open window looking for the father and daughter whose steps he heard he fancied they would never approach not only would the echoes die away as though the steps had gone but echoes of other steps that never came would be heard in their stead and would die away for good when they seemed close at hand however father and daughter did at last appear and was ready at the street door to receive them was a pleasant sight albeit wild and red and grim taking off her darling s bonnet when she came up stairs and touching it up with the ends of her handkerchief and blowing the dust off it and folding her mantle ready for laying by and smoothing her rich hair with as much pride as she could possibly have taken in her own hair if she had been the vainest and handsomest of women her darling was a pleasant sight too embracing her and thanking her and protesting against her taking so much trouble for her which last she only dared to do playfully or sorely hurt would have retired to her own chamber and cried the doctor was a pleasant sight too looking on at them and telling how she spoilt in accents and with eyes that had as much spoiling in them as had and would have had more if it were possible was a pleasant sight too beaming at all this in his little wig and thanking his bachelor stars for having lighted him in his declining years to a home but no hundreds of people came to see the sights and looked in vain for the fulfilment of s prediction dinner time and still no hundreds of people in the arrangements of the little household took charge of the lower regions and always acquitted herself marvellously her dinners of a very modest quality were so well cooked and so well served and so neat in their contrivances half english and half french that nothing could be better s friendship being of the thoroughly practical kind she had ravaged soho and the adjacent provinces in search of impoverished french who tempted by shillings and half crowns would impart culinary mysteries to her from these decayed sons and daughters of gaul she had acquired such wonderful arts that the woman and girl who formed the staff of domestics regarded her as quite a sorceress or cinderella s godmother who would send out for a fowl a rabbit a vegetable or two from the garden and change them into anything she pleased on sundays dined at the doctor s table but on other days persisted in taking her meals at unknown periods either in the lower regions or in her own room on the second floor a blue chamber to which no one but her ever gained admittance on this occasion responding to s pleasant face and pleasant efforts to please her unbent exceedingly so the dinner was very pleasant too it was an oppressive day and after dinner proposed that the wine should be carried out under the plane tree and they should sit there in the air as everything turned upon her and revolved about her they went out under the plane tree and she carried the wine down for the special benefit of she had installed herself some time before as s cup bearer and while they sat under the plane tree talking she kept his glass replenished mysterious backs and ends of houses peeped at them as they talked and the plane tree whispered to them in its own way above their heads still the hundreds of people did not present themselves presented himself while they were sitting under the plane tree but he was only one received him kindly and so did but suddenly became afflicted with a twitching in the head and body and retired into the house she was not unfrequently the victim of this disorder and she called it in familiar conversation a fit of the jerks the doctor was in his best condition and looked specially young the resemblance between him and was very strong at such times and as they sat side by side she leaning on his shoulder and he resting his arm on the back of her chair it was very agreeable to trace the likeness he had been talking all day on many subjects and with unusual vivacity pray said as they sat under the plane tree and he said it in the natural pursuit of the topic in hand which happened to be the old buildings of london have you seen much of the tower and i have been there but only casually we have seen enough of it to know that it teems with interest little more i have been there as you remember said with a smile though reddening a little angrily in another character and not in a character that gives facilities for seeing much of it they told me a curious thing when i was there what was that asked in making some alterations the workmen came upon an old dungeon which had been for many years built up and forgotten every stone of its inner wall was covered by inscriptions which had been carved by prisoners dates names complaints and prayers upon a corner stone in an angle of the wall one prisoner who seemed to have gone to execution had cut as his last work three letters they were done with some very poor instrument and hurriedly with an unsteady hand at first they were read as d i c but on being more carefully examined the last letter was found to be there was no record or legend of any prisoner with those initials and many fruitless guesses were made what the name could have been at length it was suggested that the letters were not initials but the complete word dig the floor was examined very carefully under the inscription and in the earth beneath a stone or tile or some fragment of paving were found the ashes of a paper mingled with the ashes of a small leathern case or bag what the unknown prisoner had written will never be read but he had written something and hidden it away to keep it from the gaoler my father exclaimed you are ill he had suddenly started up with his hand to his head his manner and his look quite terrified them all no my dear not ill there are large drops of rain falling and they made me start we had better go in he recovered himself almost instantly rain was really falling in large drops and he showed the back of his hand with rain drops on it but he said not a single word in reference to the discovery that had been told of and as they went into the house the business eye of either detected or fancied it detected on his face as it turned towards the same singular look that had been upon it when it turned towards him in the passages of the court house he recovered himself so quickly however that had doubts of his business eye the arm of the golden giant in the hall was not more steady than he was when he stopped under it to remark to them that he was not yet proof against slight surprises if he ever would be and that the rain had startled him tea time and making tea with another fit of the jerks upon her and yet no hundreds of people had lounged in but he made only two the night was so very sultry that although they sat with doors and windows open they were overpowered by heat when the tea table was done with they all moved to one of the windows and looked out into the heavy twilight sat by her father sat beside her leaned against a window the curtains were long and white and some of the thunder gusts that whirled into the corner caught them up to the ceiling and waved them like spectral wings the rain drops are still falling large heavy and few said it comes slowly it comes surely said they spoke low as people watching and waiting mostly do as people in a dark room watching and waiting for lightning always do there was a great hurry in the streets of people speeding away to get shelter before the storm broke the wonderful corner for echoes resounded with the echoes of footsteps coming and going yet not a footstep was there a multitude of people and yet a solitude said when they had listened for a while is it not impressive asked sometimes i have sat here of an evening until i have fancied but even the shade of a foolish fancy makes me shudder to night when all is so black and solemn let us shudder too we may know what it is it will seem nothing to you such whims are only impressive as we originate them i think they are not to be communicated i have sometimes sat alone here of an evening listening until i have made the echoes out to be the echoes of all the footsteps that are coming by and bye into our lives there is a great crowd coming one day into our lives if that be so struck in in his moody way the footsteps were incessant and the hurry of them became more and more rapid the corner echoed and re echoed with the tread of feet some as it seemed under the windows some as it seemed in the room some coming some going some breaking off some stopping altogether all in the distant streets and not one within sight are all these footsteps destined to come to all of us or are we to divide them among us i don t know i told you it was a foolish fancy but you asked for it when i have yielded myself to it i have been alone and then i have imagined them the footsteps of the people who are to come into my life and my father s i take them into mine said i ask no questions and make no stipulations there is a great crowd bearing down upon us and i see them by the lightning he added the last words after there had been a vivid flash which had shown him lounging in the window and i hear them he added again after a peal of thunder here they come fast fierce and furious it was the rush and roar of rain that he typified and it stopped him for no voice could be heard in it a memorable storm of thunder and lightning broke with that sweep of water and there was not a moment s interval in crash and fire and rain until after the moon rose at midnight the great bell of saint paul s was striking one in the cleared air when escorted by high booted and bearing a lantern set forth on his return passage to clerkenwell there were solitary patches of road on the way between soho and clerkenwell and mindful of foot pads always retained for this service though it was usually performed a good two hours earlier what a night it has been almost a night said to bring the dead out of their graves i never see the night myself master nor yet i don t expect to what would do that answered good night said the man of business good night shall we ever see such a night again together perhaps perhaps see the great crowd of people with its rush and roar bearing down upon them too monseigneur one of the great lords in power at the court held his fortnightly reception in his grand hotel in paris monseigneur was in his inner room his sanctuary of sanctuaries the holiest of holiests to the crowd of worshippers in the suite of rooms without monseigneur was about to take his chocolate monseigneur could swallow a great many things with ease and was by some few sullen minds supposed to be rather rapidly swallowing france but his morning s chocolate could not so much as get into the throat of monseigneur without the aid of four strong men besides the cook yes it took four men all four ablaze with gorgeous decoration and the chief of them unable to exist with fewer than two gold watches in his pocket emulative of the noble and chaste fashion set by monseigneur to conduct the happy chocolate to monseigneur s lips one lacquey carried the chocolate pot into the sacred presence a second milled and frothed the chocolate with the little instrument he bore for that function a third presented the favoured napkin a fourth he of the two gold watches poured the chocolate out it was impossible for monseigneur to dispense with one of these attendants on the chocolate and hold his high place under the admiring heavens deep would have been the blot upon his escutcheon if his chocolate had been ignobly waited on by only three men he must have died of two monseigneur had been out at a little supper last night where the comedy and the grand opera were charmingly represented monseigneur was out at a little supper most nights with fascinating company so polite and so impressible was monseigneur that the comedy and the grand opera had far more influence with him in the tiresome articles of state affairs and state secrets than the needs of all france a happy circumstance for france as the like always is for all countries similarly favoured always was for england by way of example in the regretted days of the merry stuart who sold it monseigneur had one truly noble idea of general public business which was to let everything go on in its own way of particular public business monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that it must all go his way tend to his own power and pocket of his pleasures general and particular monseigneur had the other truly noble idea that the world was made for them the text of his order altered from the original by only a pronoun which is not much ran the earth and the fulness thereof are mine saith monseigneur yet monseigneur had slowly found that vulgar embarrassments crept into his affairs both private and public and he had as to both classes of affairs allied himself perforce with a farmer general as to finances public because monseigneur could not make anything at all of them and must consequently let them out to somebody who could as to finances private because farmer generals were rich and monseigneur after generations of great luxury and expense was growing poor hence monseigneur had taken his sister from a convent while there was yet time to ward off the impending veil the cheapest garment she could wear and had bestowed her as a prize upon a very rich farmer general poor in family which farmer general carrying an appropriate cane with a golden apple on the top of it was now among the company in the outer rooms much prostrated before by mankind always excepting superior mankind of the blood of monseigneur who his own wife included looked down upon him with the loftiest contempt a sumptuous man was the farmer general thirty horses stood in his stables twenty four male domestics sat in his halls six body women waited on his wife as one who pretended to do nothing but plunder and forage where he could the farmer general howsoever his matrimonial relations conduced to social morality was at least the greatest reality among the personages who attended at the hotel of monseigneur that day for the rooms though a beautiful scene to look at and adorned with every device of decoration that the taste and skill of the time could achieve were in truth not a sound business considered with any reference to the scarecrows in the rags and nightcaps elsewhere and not so far off either but that the watching towers of notre dame almost equidistant from the two extremes could see them both they would have been an exceedingly uncomfortable business if that could have been anybody s business at the house of monseigneur military officers destitute of military knowledge naval officers with no idea of a ship civil officers without a notion of affairs brazen ecclesiastics of the worst world worldly with sensual eyes loose tongues and looser lives all totally unfit for their several callings all lying horribly in pretending to belong to them but all nearly or remotely of the order of monseigneur and therefore foisted on all public employments from which anything was to be got these were to be told off by the score and the score people not immediately connected with monseigneur or the state yet equally unconnected with anything that was real or with lives passed in travelling by any straight road to any true earthly end were no less abundant doctors who made great fortunes out of dainty remedies for imaginary disorders that never existed smiled upon their courtly patients in the ante chambers of monseigneur projectors who had discovered every kind of remedy for the little evils with which the state was touched except the remedy of setting to work in earnest to root out a single sin poured their distracting babble into any ears they could lay hold of at the reception of monseigneur unbelieving philosophers who were remodelling the world with words and making card towers of babel to scale the skies with talked with unbelieving chemists who had an eye on the transmutation of metals at this wonderful gathering accumulated by monseigneur exquisite gentlemen of the finest breeding which was at that remarkable time and has been since to be known by its fruits of indifference to every natural subject of human interest were in the most exemplary state of exhaustion at the hotel of monseigneur such homes had these various notabilities left behind them in the fine world of paris that the spies among the assembled devotees of monseigneur forming a goodly half of the polite company would have found it hard to discover among the angels of that sphere one solitary wife who in her manners and appearance owned to being a mother indeed except for the mere act of bringing a troublesome creature into this world which does not go far towards the realisation of the name of mother there was no such thing known to the fashion peasant women kept the unfashionable babies close and brought them up and charming grandmammas of sixty dressed and supped as at twenty the leprosy of unreality disfigured every human creature in attendance upon monseigneur in the outermost room were half a dozen exceptional people who had had for a few years some vague misgiving in them that things in general were going rather wrong as a promising way of setting them right half of the half dozen had become members of a fantastic sect of convulsionists and were even then considering within themselves whether they should foam rage roar and turn cataleptic on the spot thereby setting up a highly intelligible finger post to the future for monseigneur s guidance besides these dervishes were other three who had rushed into another sect which mended matters with a jargon about the centre of truth holding that man had got out of the centre of truth which did not need much demonstration but had not got out of the circumference and that he was to be kept from flying out of the circumference and was even to be shoved back into the centre by fasting and seeing of spirits among these accordingly much discoursing with spirits went on and it did a world of good which never became manifest but the comfort was that all the company at the grand hotel of monseigneur were perfectly dressed if the day of judgment had only been ascertained to be a dress day everybody there would have been eternally correct such frizzling and powdering and sticking up of hair such delicate complexions artificially preserved and mended such gallant swords to look at and such delicate honour to the sense of smell would surely keep anything going for ever and ever the exquisite gentlemen of the finest breeding wore little pendent trinkets that chinked as they languidly moved these golden fetters rang like precious little bells and what with that ringing and with the rustle of silk and brocade and fine linen there was a flutter in the air that fanned saint antoine and his devouring hunger far away dress was the one unfailing talisman and charm used for keeping all things in their places everybody was dressed for a fancy ball that was never to leave off from the palace of the tuileries through monseigneur and the whole court through the chambers the tribunals of justice and all society except the scarecrows the fancy ball descended to the common executioner who in pursuance of the charm was required to officiate frizzled powdered in a gold laced coat pumps and white silk stockings at the gallows and the wheel the axe was a rarity monsieur paris as it was the episcopal mode among his brother professors of the provinces monsieur orleans and the rest to call him presided in this dainty dress and who among the company at monseigneur s reception in that seventeen hundred and eightieth year of our lord could possibly doubt that a system rooted in a frizzled hangman powdered gold laced pumped and white silk stockinged would see the very stars out monseigneur having eased his four men of their burdens and taken his chocolate caused the doors of the holiest of holiests to be thrown open and issued forth then what submission what cringing and fawning what servility what abject humiliation as to bowing down in body and spirit nothing in that way was left for heaven which may have been one among other reasons why the worshippers of monseigneur never troubled it bestowing a word of promise here and a smile there a whisper on one happy slave and a wave of the hand on another monseigneur affably passed through his rooms to the remote region of the circumference of truth there monseigneur turned and came back again and so in due course of time got himself shut up in his sanctuary by the chocolate sprites and was seen no more the show being over the flutter in the air became quite a little storm and the precious little bells went ringing downstairs there was soon but one person left of all the crowd and he with his hat under his arm and his snuff box in his hand slowly passed among the mirrors on his way out i devote you said this person stopping at the last door on his way and turning in the direction of the sanctuary to the devil with that he shook the snuff from his fingers as if he had shaken the dust from his feet and quietly walked downstairs he was a man of about sixty handsomely dressed haughty in manner and with a face like a fine mask a face of a transparent paleness every feature in it clearly defined one set expression on it the nose beautifully formed otherwise was very slightly pinched at the top of each nostril in those two compressions or dints the only little change that the face ever showed resided they persisted in changing colour sometimes and they would be occasionally dilated and contracted by something like a faint pulsation then they gave a look of treachery and cruelty to the whole countenance
2,group when it was done some diamonds very bright and sparkling glanced on the bride s hand which were newly released from the dark obscurity of one of s pockets they returned home to breakfast and all went well and in due course the golden hair that had mingled with the poor shoemaker s white locks in the paris garret were mingled with them again in the morning sunlight on the threshold of the door at parting it was a hard parting though it was not for long but her father cheered her and said at last gently disengaging himself from her enfolding arms take her charles she is yours and her agitated hand waved to them from a chaise window and she was gone the corner being out of the way of the idle and curious and the preparations having been very simple and few the doctor and were left quite alone it was when they turned into the welcome shade of the cool old hall that observed a great change to have come over the doctor as if the golden arm uplifted there had struck him a poisoned blow he had naturally repressed much and some revulsion might have been expected in him when the occasion for repression was gone but it was the old scared lost look that troubled and through his absent manner of clasping his head and drearily wandering away into his own room when they got up stairs was reminded of defarge the wine shop keeper and the starlight ride i think he whispered to after anxious consideration i think we had best not speak to him just now or at all disturb him i must look in at s so i will go there at once and come back presently then we will take him a ride into the country and dine there and all will be well it was easier for to look in at s than to look out of s he was detained two hours when he came back he ascended the old staircase alone having asked no question of the servant going thus into the doctor s rooms he was stopped by a low sound of knocking good god he said with a start what s that with a terrified face was at his ear o me o me all is lost cried she wringing her hands what is to be told to ladybird he doesn t know me and is making shoes said what he could to calm her and went himself into the doctor s room the bench was turned towards the light as it had been when he had seen the shoemaker at his work before and his head was bent down and he was very busy my dear friend the doctor looked at him for a moment half inquiringly half as if he were angry at being spoken to and bent over his work again he had laid aside his coat and waistcoat his shirt was open at the throat as it used to be when he did that work and even the old haggard faded surface of face had come back to him he worked hard impatiently as if in some sense of having been interrupted glanced at the work in his hand and observed that it was a shoe of the old size and shape he took up another that was lying by him and asked what it was a young lady s walking shoe he muttered without looking up it ought to have been finished long ago let it be but look at me he obeyed in the old mechanically submissive manner without pausing in his work you know me my dear friend think again this is not your proper occupation think dear friend nothing would induce him to speak more he looked up for an instant at a time when he was requested to do so but no persuasion would extract a word from him he worked and worked and worked in silence and words fell on him as they would have fallen on an echoless wall or on the air the only ray of hope that could discover was that he sometimes furtively looked up without being asked in that there seemed a faint expression of curiosity or perplexity as though he were trying to reconcile some doubts in his mind two things at once impressed themselves on as important above all others the first that this must be kept secret from the second that it must be kept secret from all who knew him in conjunction with he took immediate steps towards the latter precaution by giving out that the doctor was not well and required a few days of complete rest in aid of the kind deception to be practised on his daughter was to write describing his having been called away professionally and referring to an imaginary letter of two or three hurried lines in his own hand represented to have been addressed to her by the same post these measures advisable to be taken in any case took in the hope of his coming to himself if that should happen soon he kept another course in reserve which was to have a certain opinion that he thought the best on the doctor s case in the hope of his recovery and of resort to this third course being thereby rendered practicable resolved to watch him attentively with as little appearance as possible of doing so he therefore made arrangements to absent himself from s for the first time in his life and took his post by the window in the same room he was not long in discovering that it was worse than useless to speak to him since on being pressed he became worried he abandoned that attempt on the first day and resolved merely to keep himself always before him as a silent protest against the delusion into which he had fallen or was falling he remained therefore in his seat near the window reading and writing and expressing in as many pleasant and natural ways as he could think of that it was a free place took what was given him to eat and drink and worked on that first day until it was too dark to see worked on half an hour after could not have seen for his life to read or write when he put his tools aside as useless until morning rose and said to him will you go out he looked down at the floor on either side of him in the old manner looked up in the old manner and repeated in the old low voice out yes for a walk with me why not he made no effort to say why not and said not a word more but thought he saw as he leaned forward on his bench in the dusk with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands that he was in some misty way asking himself why not the sagacity of the man of business perceived an advantage here and determined to hold it and he divided the night into two watches and observed him at intervals from the adjoining room he paced up and down for a long time before he lay down but when he did finally lay himself down he fell asleep in the morning he was up betimes and went straight to his bench and to work on this second day saluted him cheerfully by his name and spoke to him on topics that had been of late familiar to them he returned no reply but it was evident that he heard what was said and that he thought about it however confusedly this encouraged to have in with her work several times during the day at those times they quietly spoke of and of her father then present precisely in the usual manner and as if there were nothing amiss this was done without any demonstrative accompaniment not long enough or often enough to harass him and it lightened s friendly heart to believe that he looked up oftener and that he appeared to be stirred by some perception of inconsistencies surrounding him when it fell dark again asked him as before dear doctor will you go out as before he repeated out yes for a walk with me why not this time feigned to go out when he could extract no answer from him and after remaining absent for an hour returned in the meanwhile the doctor had removed to the seat in the window and had sat there looking down at the plane tree but on s return he slipped away to his bench the time went very slowly on and s hope darkened and his heart grew heavier again and grew yet heavier and heavier every day the third day came and went the fourth the fifth five days six days seven days eight days nine days with a hope ever darkening and with a heart always growing heavier and heavier passed through this anxious time the secret was well kept and was unconscious and happy but he could not fail to observe that the shoemaker whose hand had been a little out at first was growing dreadfully skilful and that he had never been so intent on his work and that his hands had never been so nimble and expert as in the dusk of the ninth evening worn out by anxious watching fell asleep at his post on the tenth morning of his suspense he was startled by the shining of the sun into the room where a heavy slumber had overtaken him when it was dark night he rubbed his eyes and roused himself but he doubted when he had done so whether he was not still asleep for going to the door of the doctor s room and looking in he perceived that the shoemaker s bench and tools were put aside again and that the doctor himself sat reading at the window he was in his usual morning dress and his face which could distinctly see though still very pale was calmly studious and attentive even when he had satisfied himself that he was awake felt giddily uncertain for some few moments whether the late shoemaking might not be a disturbed dream of his own for did not his eyes show him his friend before him in his accustomed clothing and aspect and employed as usual and was there any sign within their range that the change of which he had so strong an impression had actually happened it was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment the answer being obvious if the impression were not produced by a real corresponding and sufficient cause how came he there how came he to have fallen asleep in his clothes on the sofa in s consulting room and to be debating these points outside the doctor s bedroom door in the early morning within a few minutes stood whispering at his side if he had had any particle of doubt left her talk would of necessity have resolved it but he was by that time clear headed and had none he advised that they should let the time go by until the regular breakfast hour and should then meet the doctor as if nothing unusual had occurred if he appeared to be in his customary state of mind would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from the opinion he had been in his anxiety so anxious to obtain submitting herself to his judgment the scheme was worked out with care having abundance of time for his usual methodical toilette presented himself at the breakfast hour in his usual white linen and with his usual neat leg the doctor was summoned in the usual way and came to breakfast so far as it was possible to comprehend him without overstepping those delicate and gradual approaches which felt to be the only safe advance he at first supposed that his daughter s marriage had taken place yesterday an incidental allusion purposely thrown out to the day of the week and the day of the month set him thinking and counting and evidently made him uneasy in all other respects however he was so composedly himself that determined to have the aid he sought and that aid was his own therefore when the breakfast was done and cleared away and he and the doctor were left together said feelingly my dear i am anxious to have your opinion in confidence on a very curious case in which i am deeply interested that is to say it is very curious to me perhaps to your better information it may be less so glancing at his hands which were discoloured by his late work the doctor looked troubled and listened attentively he had already glanced at his hands more than once said touching him affectionately on the arm the case is the case of a particularly dear friend of mine pray give your mind to it and advise me well for his sake and above all for his daughter s his daughter s my dear if i understand said the doctor in a subdued tone some mental shock yes be explicit said the doctor spare no detail saw that they understood one another and proceeded my dear it is the case of an old and a prolonged shock of great acuteness and severity to the affections the feelings the the as you express it the mind the mind it is the case of a shock under which the sufferer was borne down one cannot say for how long because i believe he cannot calculate the time himself and there are no other means of getting at it it is the case of a shock from which the sufferer recovered by a process that he cannot trace himself as i once heard him publicly relate in a striking manner it is the case of a shock from which he has recovered so completely as to be a highly intelligent man capable of close application of mind and great exertion of body and of constantly making fresh additions to his stock of knowledge which was already very large but unfortunately there has been he paused and took a deep breath a slight relapse the doctor in a low voice asked of how long duration nine days and nights how did it show itself i infer glancing at his hands again in the resumption of some old pursuit connected with the shock that is the fact now did you ever see him asked the doctor distinctly and collectedly though in the same low voice engaged in that pursuit originally once and when the relapse fell on him was he in most respects or in all respects as he was then i think in all respects you spoke of his daughter does his daughter know of the relapse no it has been kept from her and i hope will always be kept from her it is known only to myself and to one other who may be trusted the doctor grasped his hand and murmured that was very kind that was very thoughtful grasped his hand in return and neither of the two spoke for a little while now my dear said at length in his most considerate and most affectionate way i am a mere man of business and unfit to cope with such intricate and difficult matters i do not possess the kind of information necessary i do not possess the kind of intelligence i want guiding there is no man in this world on whom i could so rely for right guidance as on you tell me how does this relapse come about is there danger of another could a repetition of it be prevented how should a repetition of it be treated how does it come about at all what can i do for my friend no man ever can have been more desirous in his heart to serve a friend than i am to serve mine if i knew how but i don t know how to originate in such a case if your sagacity knowledge and experience could put me on the right track i might be able to do so much unenlightened and undirected i can do so little pray discuss it with me pray enable me to see it a little more clearly and teach me how to be a little more useful sat meditating after these earnest words were spoken and did not press him i think it probable said the doctor breaking silence with an effort that the relapse you have described my dear friend was not quite unforeseen by its subject was it dreaded by him ventured to ask very much he said it with an involuntary shudder you have no idea how such an apprehension weighs on the sufferer s mind and how difficult how almost impossible it is for him to force himself to utter a word upon the topic that oppresses him would he asked be sensibly relieved if he could prevail upon himself to impart that secret brooding to any one when it is on him i think so but it is as i have told you next to impossible i even believe it in some cases to be quite impossible now said gently laying his hand on the doctor s arm again after a short silence on both sides to what would you refer this attack i believe returned that there had been a strong and extraordinary revival of the train of thought and remembrance that was the first cause of the malady some intense associations of a most distressing nature were vividly recalled i think it is probable that there had long been a dread lurking in his mind that those associations would be recalled say under certain circumstances say on a particular occasion he tried to prepare himself in vain perhaps the effort to prepare himself made him less able to bear it would he remember what took place in the relapse asked with natural hesitation the doctor looked desolately round the room shook his head and answered in a low voice not at all now as to the future hinted as to the future said the doctor recovering firmness i should have great hope as it pleased heaven in its mercy to restore him so soon i should have great hope he yielding under the pressure of a complicated something long dreaded and long vaguely foreseen and contended against and recovering after the cloud had burst and passed i should hope that the worst was over well well that s good comfort i am thankful said i am thankful repeated the doctor bending his head with reverence there are two other points said on which i am anxious to be instructed i may go on you cannot do your friend a better service the doctor gave him his hand to the first then he is of a studious habit and unusually energetic he applies himself with great ardour to the acquisition of professional knowledge to the conducting of experiments to many things now does he do too much i think not it may be the character of his mind to be always in singular need of occupation that may be in part natural to it in part the result of affliction the less it was occupied with healthy things the more it would be in danger of turning in the unhealthy direction he may have observed himself and made the discovery you are sure that he is not under too great a strain i think i am quite sure of it my dear if he were overworked now my dear i doubt if that could easily be there has been a violent stress in one direction and it needs a counterweight excuse me as a persistent man of business assuming for a moment that he was overworked it would show itself in some renewal of this disorder i do not think so i do not think said with the firmness of self conviction that anything but the one train of association would renew it i think that henceforth nothing but some extraordinary jarring of that chord could renew it after what has happened and after his recovery i find it difficult to imagine any such violent sounding of that string again i trust and i almost believe that the circumstances likely to renew it are exhausted he spoke with the diffidence of a man who knew how slight a thing would overset the delicate organisation of the mind and yet with the confidence of a man who had slowly won his assurance out of personal endurance and distress it was not for his friend to abate that confidence he professed himself more relieved and encouraged than he really was and approached his second and last point he felt it to be the most difficult of all but remembering his old sunday morning conversation with and remembering what he had seen in the last nine days he knew that he must face it the occupation resumed under the influence of this passing affliction so happily recovered from said clearing his throat we will call blacksmith s work blacksmith s work we will say to put a case and for the sake of illustration that he had been used in his bad time to work at a little forge we will say that he was unexpectedly found at his forge again is it not a pity that he should keep it by him the doctor shaded his forehead with his hand and beat his foot nervously on the ground he has always kept it by him said with an anxious look at his friend now would it not be better that he should let it go still the doctor with shaded forehead beat his foot nervously on the ground you do not find it easy to advise me said i quite understand it to be a nice question and yet i think and there he shook his head and stopped you see said turning to him after an uneasy pause it is very hard to explain consistently the innermost workings of this poor man s mind he once yearned so frightfully for that occupation and it was so welcome when it came no doubt it relieved his pain so much by substituting the perplexity of the fingers for the perplexity of the brain and by substituting as he became more practised the ingenuity of the hands for the ingenuity of the mental torture that he has never been able to bear the thought of putting it quite out of his reach even now when i believe he is more hopeful of himself than he has ever been and even speaks of himself with a kind of confidence the idea that he might need that old employment and not find it gives him a sudden sense of terror like that which one may fancy strikes to the heart of a lost child he looked like his illustration as he raised his eyes to s face but may not mind i ask for information as a plodding man of business who only deals with such material objects as guineas shillings and bank notes may not the retention of the thing involve the retention of the idea if the thing were gone my dear might not the fear go with it in short is it not a concession to the misgiving to keep the forge there was another silence you see too said the doctor tremulously it is such an old companion i would not keep it said shaking his head for he gained in firmness as he saw
3,yes i know you citizen doctor we all know you citizen doctor said the other three he looked abstractedly from one to another and said in a lower voice after a pause will you answer his question to me then how does this happen citizen doctor said the first reluctantly he has been denounced to the section of saint antoine this citizen pointing out the second who had entered is from saint antoine the citizen here indicated nodded his head and added he is accused by saint antoine of what asked the doctor citizen doctor said the first with his former reluctance ask no more if the republic demands sacrifices from you without doubt you as a good patriot will be happy to make them the republic goes before all the people is supreme we are pressed one word the doctor entreated will you tell me who denounced him it is against rule answered the first but you can ask him of saint antoine here the doctor turned his eyes upon that man who moved uneasily on his feet rubbed his beard a little and at length said well truly it is against rule but he is denounced and gravely by the citizen and citizeness and by one other what other do you ask citizen doctor yes then said he of saint antoine with a strange look you will be answered to morrow now i am dumb happily unconscious of the new calamity at home threaded her way along the narrow streets and crossed the river by the bridge of the pont neuf reckoning in her mind the number of indispensable purchases she had to make with the basket walked at her side they both looked to the right and to the left into most of the shops they passed had a wary eye for all gregarious assemblages of people and turned out of their road to avoid any very excited group of talkers it was a raw evening and the misty river blurred to the eye with blazing lights and to the ear with harsh noises showed where the barges were stationed in which the smiths worked making guns for the army of the republic woe to the man who played tricks with that army or got undeserved promotion in it better for him that his beard had never grown for the national razor shaved him close having purchased a few small articles of grocery and a measure of oil for the lamp bethought herself of the wine they wanted after peeping into several wine shops she stopped at the sign of the good republican brutus of antiquity not far from the national palace once and twice the where the aspect of things rather took her fancy it had a quieter look than any other place of the same description they had passed and though red with patriotic caps was not so red as the rest sounding and finding him of her opinion resorted to the good republican brutus of antiquity attended by her cavalier slightly observant of the smoky lights of the people pipe in mouth playing with limp cards and yellow dominoes of the one bare breasted bare armed soot begrimed workman reading a journal aloud and of the others listening to him of the weapons worn or laid aside to be resumed of the two or three customers fallen forward asleep who in the popular high shouldered shaggy black spencer looked in that attitude like slumbering bears or dogs the two outlandish customers approached the counter and showed what they wanted as their wine was measuring out a man parted from another man in a corner and rose to depart in going he had to face no sooner did he face her than uttered a scream and clapped her hands in a moment the whole company were on their feet that somebody was assassinated by somebody vindicating a difference of opinion was the likeliest occurrence everybody looked to see somebody fall but only saw a man and a woman standing staring at each other the man with all the outward aspect of a frenchman and a thorough republican the woman evidently english what was said in this disappointing anti climax by the disciples of the good republican brutus of antiquity except that it was something very voluble and loud would have been as so much hebrew or chaldean to and her protector though they had been all ears but they had no ears for anything in their surprise for it must be recorded that not only was lost in amazement and agitation but though it seemed on his own separate and individual account was in a state of the greatest wonder what is the matter said the man who had caused to scream speaking in a vexed abrupt voice though in a low tone and in english oh dear cried clapping her hands again after not setting eyes upon you or hearing of you for so long a time do i find you here don t call me do you want to be the death of me asked the man in a furtive frightened way brother brother cried bursting into tears have i ever been so hard with you that you ask me such a cruel question then hold your meddlesome tongue said and come out if you want to speak to me pay for your wine and come out who s this man shaking her loving and dejected head at her by no means affectionate brother said through her tears let him come out too said does he think me a ghost apparently did to judge from his looks he said not a word however and exploring the depths of her reticule through her tears with great difficulty paid for her wine as she did so turned to the followers of the good republican brutus of antiquity and offered a few words of explanation in the french language which caused them all to relapse into their former places and pursuits now said stopping at the dark street corner what do you want how dreadfully unkind in a brother nothing has ever turned my love away from cried to give me such a greeting and show me no affection there confound it there said making a dab at s lips with his own now are you content only shook her head and wept in silence if you expect me to be surprised said her brother i am not surprised i knew you were here i know of most people who are here if you really don t want to endanger my existence which i half believe you do go your ways as soon as possible and let me go mine i am busy i am an official my english brother mourned casting up her tear fraught eyes that had the makings in him of one of the best and greatest of men in his native country an official among foreigners and such foreigners i would almost sooner have seen the dear boy lying in his i said so cried her brother interrupting i knew it you want to be the death of me i shall be rendered suspected by my own sister just as i am getting on the gracious and merciful heavens forbid cried far rather would i never see you again dear though i have ever loved you truly and ever shall say but one affectionate word to me and tell me there is nothing angry or estranged between us and i will detain you no longer good as if the estrangement between them had come of any culpability of hers as if had not known it for a fact years ago in the quiet corner in soho that this precious brother had spent her money and left her he was saying the affectionate word however with a far more grudging condescension and patronage than he could have shown if their relative merits and positions had been reversed which is invariably the case all the world over when touching him on the shoulder hoarsely and unexpectedly interposed with the following singular question i say might i ask the favour as to whether your name is or the official turned towards him with sudden distrust he had not previously uttered a word come said speak out you know which by the way was more than he could do himself or she calls you and she must know being your sister and i know you re you know which of the two goes first and regarding that name of likewise that warn t your name over the water what do you mean well i don t know all i mean for i can t call to mind what your name was over the water no no but i ll swear it was a name of two syllables indeed yes t other one s was one syllable i know you you was a spy witness at the bailey what in the name of the father of lies own father to yourself was you called at that time said another voice striking in that s the name for a thousand pound cried the speaker who struck in was he had his hands behind him under the skirts of his riding coat and he stood at s elbow as negligently as he might have stood at the old bailey itself don t be alarmed my dear i arrived at s to his surprise yesterday evening we agreed that i would not present myself elsewhere until all was well or unless i could be useful i present myself here to beg a little talk with your brother i wish you had a better employed brother than i wish for your sake was not a sheep of the prisons sheep was a cant word of the time for a spy under the gaolers the spy who was pale turned paler and asked him how he dared i ll tell you said i lighted on you coming out of the prison of the conciergerie while i was contemplating the walls an hour or more ago you have a face to be remembered and i remember faces well made curious by seeing you in that connection and having a reason to which you are no stranger for associating you with the misfortunes of a friend now very unfortunate i walked in your direction i walked into the wine shop here close after you and sat near you i had no difficulty in deducing from your unreserved conversation and the rumour openly going about among your admirers the nature of your calling and gradually what i had done at random seemed to shape itself into a purpose what purpose the spy asked it would be troublesome and might be dangerous to explain in the street could you favour me in confidence with some minutes of your company at the office of s bank for instance under a threat oh did i say that then why should i go there really i can t say if you can t do you mean that you won t say sir the spy irresolutely asked you apprehend me very clearly i won t s negligent recklessness of manner came powerfully in aid of his quickness and skill in such a business as he had in his secret mind and with such a man as he had to do with his practised eye saw it and made the most of it now i told you so said the spy casting a reproachful look at his sister if any trouble comes of this it s your doing come come exclaimed don t be ungrateful but for my great respect for your sister i might not have led up so pleasantly to a little proposal that i wish to make for our mutual satisfaction do you go with me to the bank i ll hear what you have got to say yes i ll go with you i propose that we first conduct your sister safely to the corner of her own street let me take your arm this is not a good city at this time for you to be out in unprotected and as your escort knows i will invite him to s with us are we ready come then recalled soon afterwards and to the end of her life remembered that as she pressed her hands on s arm and looked up in his face imploring him to do no hurt to there was a braced purpose in the arm and a kind of inspiration in the eyes which not only contradicted his light manner but changed and raised the man she was too much occupied then with fears for the brother who so little deserved her affection and with s friendly reassurances adequately to heed what she observed they left her at the corner of the street and led the way to s which was within a few minutes walk or walked at his side had just finished his dinner and was sitting before a cheery little log or two of fire perhaps looking into their blaze for the picture of that younger elderly gentleman from s who had looked into the red coals at the royal george at dover now a good many years ago he turned his head as they entered and showed the surprise with which he saw a stranger s brother sir said repeated the old gentleman i have an association with the name and with the face i told you you had a remarkable face observed coolly pray sit down as he took a chair himself he supplied the link that wanted by saying to him with a frown witness at that trial immediately remembered and regarded his new visitor with an undisguised look of abhorrence has been recognised by as the affectionate brother you have heard of said and has acknowledged the relationship i pass to worse news has been arrested again struck with consternation the old gentleman exclaimed what do you tell me i left him safe and free within these two hours and am about to return to him arrested for all that when was it done just now if at all is the best authority possible sir said and i have it from s communication to a friend and brother sheep over a bottle of wine that the arrest has taken place he left the messengers at the gate and saw them admitted by the porter there is no earthly doubt that he is retaken s business eye read in the speaker s face that it was loss of time to dwell upon the point confused but sensible that something might depend on his presence of mind he commanded himself and was silently attentive now i trust said to him that the name and influence of may stand him in as good stead to morrow you said he would be before the tribunal again to morrow yes i believe so in as good stead to morrow as to day but it may not be so i own to you i am shaken by s not having had the power to prevent this arrest he may not have known of it beforehand said but that very circumstance would be alarming when we remember how identified he is with his son in law that s true acknowledged with his troubled hand at his chin and his troubled eyes on in short said this is a desperate time when desperate games are played for desperate stakes let the doctor play the winning game i will play the losing one no man s life here is worth purchase any one carried home by the people to day may be condemned tomorrow now the stake i have resolved to play for in case of the worst is a friend in the conciergerie and the friend i purpose to myself to win is you need have good cards sir said the spy i ll run them over i ll see what i hold you know what a brute i am i wish you d give me a little brandy it was put before him and he drank off a glassful drank off another glassful pushed the bottle thoughtfully away he went on in the tone of one who really was looking over a hand at cards sheep of the prisons emissary of republican committees now turnkey now prisoner always spy and secret informer so much the more valuable here for being english that an englishman is less open to suspicion of subornation in those characters than a frenchman represents himself to his employers under a false name that s a very good card now in the employ of the republican french government was formerly in the employ of the aristocratic english government the enemy of france and freedom that s an excellent card inference clear as day in this region of suspicion that still in the pay of the aristocratic english government is the spy of the treacherous foe of the republic crouching in its bosom the english traitor and agent of all mischief so much spoken of and so difficult to find that s a card not to be beaten have you followed my hand not to understand your play returned the spy somewhat uneasily i play my ace denunciation of to the nearest section committee look over your hand and see what you have don t hurry he drew the bottle near poured out another glassful of brandy and drank it off he saw that the spy was fearful of his drinking himself into a fit state for the immediate denunciation of him seeing it he poured out and drank another glassful look over your hand carefully take time it was a poorer hand than he suspected saw losing cards in it that knew nothing of thrown out of his honourable employment in england through too much unsuccessful hard swearing there not because he was not wanted there our english reasons for vaunting our superiority to secrecy and spies are of very modern date he knew that he had crossed the channel and accepted service in france first as a tempter and an eavesdropper among his own countrymen there gradually as a tempter and an eavesdropper among the natives he knew that under the overthrown government he had been a spy upon saint antoine and s wine shop had received from the watchful police such heads of information concerning s imprisonment release and history as should serve him for an introduction to familiar conversation with the s and tried them on and had broken down with them signally he always remembered with fear and trembling that that terrible woman had knitted when he talked with her and had looked ominously at him as her fingers moved he had since seen her in the section of saint antoine over and over again produce her knitted registers and denounce people whose lives the guillotine then surely swallowed up he knew as every one employed as he was did that he was never safe that flight was impossible that he was tied fast under the shadow of the axe and that in spite of his utmost tergiversation and treachery in furtherance of the reigning terror a word might bring it down upon him once denounced and on such grave grounds as had just now been suggested to his mind he foresaw that the dreadful woman of whose unrelenting character he had seen many proofs would produce against him that fatal register and would quash his last chance of life besides that all secret men are men soon terrified here were surely cards enough of one black suit to justify the holder in growing rather livid as he turned them over you scarcely seem to like your hand said with the greatest composure do you play i think sir said the spy in the meanest manner as he turned to i may appeal to a gentleman of your years and benevolence to put it to this other gentleman so much your junior whether he can under any circumstances reconcile it to his station to play that ace of which he has spoken i admit that i am a spy and that it is considered a discreditable station though it must be filled by somebody but this gentleman is no spy and why should he so demean himself as to make himself one i play my ace said taking the answer on himself and looking at his watch without any scruple in a very few minutes i should have hoped gentlemen both said the spy always striving to hook into the discussion that your respect for my sister i could not better testify my respect for your sister than by finally relieving her of her brother said you think not sir i have thoroughly made up my mind about it the smooth manner of the spy curiously in dissonance with his ostentatiously rough dress and probably with his usual demeanour received such a check from the inscrutability of who was a mystery to wiser and honester men than he that it faltered here and failed him while he was at a loss said resuming his former air of contemplating cards and indeed now i think again i have a strong impression that i have another good card here not yet enumerated that friend and fellow sheep who spoke of himself as pasturing in the country prisons who was he french you don t know him said the spy quickly french eh repeated musing and not appearing to notice him at all though he echoed his word well he may be is i assure you said the spy though it s not important though it s not important repeated in the same mechanical way though it s not important no it s not important no yet i know the face i think not i am sure not it can t be said the spy it can t be muttered retrospectively and idling his glass which fortunately was a small one again can t be spoke good french yet like a foreigner i thought provincial said the spy no foreign cried striking his open hand on the table as a light broke clearly on his mind disguised but the same man we had that man before us at the old bailey now there you are hasty sir said with a smile that gave his aquiline nose an extra inclination to one side there you really give me an advantage over you who i will unreservedly admit at this distance of time was a partner of mine has been dead several years i attended him in his last illness he was buried in london at the church of saint pancras in the fields his unpopularity with the blackguard multitude at the moment prevented my following his remains but i helped to lay him in his coffin here became aware from where he sat of a most remarkable goblin shadow on the wall tracing it to its source he discovered it to be caused by a sudden extraordinary rising and stiffening of all the risen and stiff hair on s head let us be reasonable said the spy and let us be fair to show you how mistaken you are and what an unfounded assumption yours is i will lay before you a certificate of s burial which i happened to have carried in my pocket book with a hurried hand he produced and opened it ever since there it is oh look at it look at it you may take it in your hand it s no forgery here perceived the reflection on the wall to elongate and rose and stepped forward his hair could not have been more violently on end if it had been that moment dressed by
