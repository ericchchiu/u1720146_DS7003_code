GE(Mddlem...),does it seem incongruous to you that a middlemarch surgeon should dream of himself as a discoverer most of us indeed know little of the great originators until they have been lifted up among the constellations and already rule our fates but that herschel for example who broke the barriers of the heavens did he not once play a provincial church organ and give music lessons to stumbling pianists each of those shining ones had to walk on the earth among neighbors who perhaps thought much more of his gait and his garments than of anything which was to give him a title to everlasting fame each of them had his little local personal history sprinkled with small temptations and sordid cares which made the retarding friction of his course towards final companionship with the immortals lydgate was not blind to the dangers of such friction but he had plenty of confidence in his resolution to avoid it as far as possible being seven and twenty he felt himself experienced and he was not going to have his vanities provoked by contact with the showy worldly successes of the capital but to live among people who could hold no rivalry with that pursuit of a great idea which was to be a twin object with the assiduous practice of his profession there was fascination in the hope that the two purposes would illuminate each other the careful observation and inference which was his daily work the use of the lens to further his judgment in special cases would further his thought as an instrument of larger inquiry was not this the typical pre eminence of his profession he would be a good middlemarch doctor and by that very means keep himself in the track of far reaching investigation on one point he may fairly claim approval at this particular stage of his career he did not mean to imitate those philanthropic models who make a profit out of poisonous pickles to support themselves while they are exposing adulteration or hold shares in a gambling hell that they may have leisure to represent the cause of public morality he intended to begin in his own case some particular reforms which were quite certainly within his reach and much less of a problem than the demonstrating of an anatomical conception one of these reforms was to act stoutly on the strength of a recent legal decision and simply prescribe without dispensing drugs or taking percentage from druggists this was an innovation for one who had chosen to adopt the style of general practitioner in a country town and would be felt as offensive criticism by his professional brethren but lydgate meant to innovate in his treatment also and he was wise enough to see that the best security for his practising honestly according to his belief was to get rid of systematic temptations to the contrary perhaps that was a more cheerful time for observers and theorizers than the present we are apt to think it the finest era of the world when america was beginning to be discovered when a bold sailor even if he were wrecked might alight on a new kingdom and about 1829 the dark territories of pathology were a fine america for a spirited young adventurer lydgate was ambitious above all to contribute towards enlarging the scientific rational basis of his profession the more he became interested in special questions of disease such as the nature of fever or fevers the more keenly he felt the need for that fundamental knowledge of structure which just at the beginning of the century had been illuminated by the brief and glorious career of bichat who died when he was only one and thirty but like another alexander left a realm large enough for many heirs that great frenchman first carried out the conception that living bodies fundamentally considered are not associations of organs which can be understood by studying them first apart and then as it were federally but must be regarded as consisting of certain primary webs or tissues out of which the various organs brain heart lungs and so on are compacted as the various accommodations of a house are built up in various proportions of wood iron stone brick zinc and the rest each material having its peculiar composition and proportions no man one sees can understand and estimate the entire structure or its parts what are its frailties and what its repairs without knowing the nature of the materials and the conception wrought out by bichat with his detailed study of the different tissues acted necessarily on medical questions as the turning of gas light would act on a dim oil lit street showing new connections and hitherto hidden facts of structure which must be taken into account in considering the symptoms of maladies and the action of medicaments but results which depend on human conscience and intelligence work slowly and now at the end of 1829 most medical practice was still strutting or shambling along the old paths and there was still scientific work to be done which might have seemed to be a direct sequence of bichat s this great seer did not go beyond the consideration of the tissues as ultimate facts in the living organism marking the limit of anatomical analysis but it was open to another mind to say have not these structures some common basis from which they have all started as your sarsnet gauze net satin and velvet from the raw cocoon here would be another light as of oxy hydrogen showing the very grain of things and revising all former explanations of this sequence to bichat s work already vibrating along many currents of the european mind lydgate was enamoured he longed to demonstrate the more intimate relations of living structure and help to define men s thought more accurately after the true order the work had not yet been done but only prepared for those who knew how to use the preparation what was the primitive tissue in that way lydgate put the question not quite in the way required by the awaiting answer but such missing of the right word befalls many seekers and he counted on quiet intervals to be watchfully seized for taking up the threads of investigation on many hints to be won from diligent application not only of the scalpel but of the microscope which research had begun to use again with new enthusiasm of reliance such was lydgate s plan of his future to do good small work for middlemarch and great work for the world he was certainly a happy fellow at this time to be seven and twenty without any fixed vices with a generous resolution that his action should be beneficent and with ideas in his brain that made life interesting quite apart from the cultus of horseflesh and other mystic rites of costly observance which the eight hundred pounds left him after buying his practice would certainly not have gone far in paying for he was at a starting point which makes many a man s career a fine subject for betting if there were any gentlemen given to that amusement who could appreciate the complicated probabilities of an arduous purpose with all the possible thwartings and furtherings of circumstance all the niceties of inward balance by which a man swims and makes his point or else is carried headlong the risk would remain even with close knowledge of lydgate s character for character too is a process and an unfolding the man was still in the making as much as the middlemarch doctor and immortal discoverer and there were both virtues and faults capable of shrinking or expanding the faults will not i hope be a reason for the withdrawal of your interest in him among our valued friends is there not some one or other who is a little too self confident and disdainful whose distinguished mind is a little spotted with commonness who is a little pinched here and protuberant there with native prejudices or whose better energies are liable to lapse down the wrong channel under the influence of transient solicitations all these things might be alleged against lydgate but then they are the periphrases of a polite preacher who talks of adam and would not like to mention anything painful to the pew renters the particular faults from which these delicate generalities are distilled have distinguishable physiognomies diction accent and grimaces filling up parts in very various dramas our vanities differ as our noses do all conceit is not the same conceit but varies in correspondence with the minutiae of mental make in which one of us differs from another lydgate s conceit was of the arrogant sort never simpering never impertinent but massive in its claims and benevolently contemptuous he would do a great deal for noodles being sorry for them and feeling quite sure that they could have no power over him he had thought of joining the saint simonians when he was in paris in order to turn them against some of their own doctrines all his faults were marked by kindred traits and were those of a man who had a fine baritone whose clothes hung well upon him and who even in his ordinary gestures had an air of inbred distinction where then lay the spots of commonness says a young lady enamoured of that careless grace how could there be any commonness in a man so well bred so ambitious of social distinction so generous and unusual in his views of social duty as easily as there may be stupidity in a man of genius if you take him unawares on the wrong subject or as many a man who has the best will to advance the social millennium might be ill inspired in imagining its lighter pleasures unable to go beyond offenbach s music or the brilliant punning in the last burlesque lydgate s spots of commonness lay in the complexion of his prejudices which in spite of noble intention and sympathy were half of them such as are found in ordinary men of the world that distinction of mind which belonged to his intellectual ardor did not penetrate his feeling and judgment about furniture or women or the desirability of its being known without his telling that he was better born than other country surgeons he did not mean to think of furniture at present but whenever he did so it was to be feared that neither biology nor schemes of reform would lift him above the vulgarity of feeling that there would be an incompatibility in his furniture not being of the best as to women he had once already been drawn headlong by impetuous folly which he meant to be final since marriage at some distant period would of course not be impetuous for those who want to be acquainted with lydgate it will be good to know what was that case of impetuous folly for it may stand as an example of the fitful swerving of passion to which he was prone together with the chivalrous kindness which helped to make him morally lovable the story can be told without many words it happened when he was studying in paris and just at the time when over and above his other work he was occupied with some galvanic experiments one evening tired with his experimenting and not being able to elicit the facts he needed he left his frogs and rabbits to some repose under their trying and mysterious dispensation of unexplained shocks and went to finish his evening at the theatre of the porte saint martin where there was a melodrama which he had already seen several times attracted not by the ingenious work of the collaborating authors but by an actress whose part it was to stab her lover mistaking him for the evil designing duke of the piece lydgate was in love with this actress as a man is in love with a woman whom he never expects to speak to she was a provencale with dark eyes a greek profile and rounded majestic form having that sort of beauty which carries a sweet matronliness even in youth and her voice was a soft cooing she had but lately come to paris and bore a virtuous reputation her husband acting with her as the unfortunate lover it was her acting which was no better than it should be but the public was satisfied lydgate s only relaxation now was to go and look at this woman just as he might have thrown himself under the breath of the sweet south on a bank of violets for a while without prejudice to his galvanism to which he would presently return but this evening the old drama had a new catastrophe at the moment when the heroine was to act the stabbing of her lover and he was to fall gracefully the wife veritably stabbed her husband who fell as death willed a wild shriek pierced the house and the provencale fell swooning a shriek and a swoon were demanded by the play but the swooning too was real this time lydgate leaped and climbed he hardly knew how on to the stage and was active in help making the acquaintance of his heroine by finding a contusion on her head and lifting her gently in his arms paris rang with the story of this death was it a murder some of the actress s warmest admirers were inclined to believe in her guilt and liked her the better for it such was the taste of those times but lydgate was not one of these he vehemently contended for her innocence and the remote impersonal passion for her beauty which he had felt before had passed now into personal devotion and tender thought of her lot the notion of murder was absurd no motive was discoverable the young couple being understood to dote on each other and it was not unprecedented that an accidental slip of the foot should have brought these grave consequences the legal investigation ended in madame laure s release lydgate by this time had had many interviews with her and found her more and more adorable she talked little but that was an additional charm she was melancholy and seemed grateful her presence was enough like that of the evening light lydgate was madly anxious about her affection and jealous lest any other man than himself should win it and ask her to marry him but instead of reopening her engagement at the porte saint martin where she would have been all the more popular for the fatal episode she left paris without warning forsaking her little court of admirers perhaps no one carried inquiry far except lydgate who felt that all science had come to a stand still while he imagined the unhappy laure stricken by ever wandering sorrow herself wandering and finding no faithful comforter hidden actresses however are not so difficult to find as some other hidden facts and it was not long before lydgate gathered indications that laure had taken the route to lyons he found her at last acting with great success at avignon under the same name looking more majestic than ever as a forsaken wife carrying her child in her arms he spoke to her after the play was received with the usual quietude which seemed to him beautiful as clear depths of water and obtained leave to visit her the next day when he was bent on telling her that he adored her and on asking her to marry him he knew that this was like the sudden impulse of a madman incongruous even with his habitual foibles no matter it was the one thing which he was resolved to do he had two selves within him apparently and they must learn to accommodate each other and bear reciprocal impediments strange that some of us with quick alternate vision see beyond our infatuations and even while we rave on the heights behold the wide plain where our persistent self pauses and awaits us to have approached laure with any suit that was not reverentially tender would have been simply a contradiction of his whole feeling towards her you have come all the way from paris to find me she said to him the next day sitting before him with folded arms and looking at him with eyes that seemed to wonder as an untamed ruminating animal wonders are all englishmen like that i came because i could not live without trying to see you you are lonely i love you i want you to consent to be my wife i will wait but i want you to promise that you will marry me no one else laure looked at him in silence with a melancholy radiance from under her grand eyelids until he was full of rapturous certainty and knelt close to her knees i will tell you something she said in her cooing way keeping her arms folded my foot really slipped i know i know said lydgate deprecatingly it was a fatal accident a dreadful stroke of calamity that bound me to you the more again laure paused a little and then said slowly i meant to do it lydgate strong man as he was turned pale and trembled moments seemed to pass before he rose and stood at a distance from her there was a secret then he said at last even vehemently he was brutal to you you hated him no he wearied me he was too fond he would live in paris and not in my country that was not agreeable to me great god said lydgate in a groan of horror and you planned to murder him i did not plan it came to me in the play i meant to do it lydgate stood mute and unconsciously pressed his hat on while he looked at her he saw this woman the first to whom he had given his young adoration amid the throng of stupid criminals you are a good young man she said but i do not like husbands i will never have another three days afterwards lydgate was at his galvanism again in his paris chambers believing that illusions were at an end for him he was saved from hardening effects by the abundant kindness of his heart and his belief that human life might be made better but he had more reason than ever for trusting his judgment now that it was so experienced and henceforth he would take a strictly scientific view of woman entertaining no expectations but such as were justified beforehand no one in middlemarch was likely to have such a notion of lydgate s past as has here been faintly shadowed and indeed the respectable townsfolk there were not more given than mortals generally to any eager attempt at exactness in the representation to themselves of what did not come under their own senses not only young virgins of that town but gray bearded men also were often in haste to conjecture how a new acquaintance might be wrought into their purposes contented with very vague knowledge as to the way in which life had been shaping him for that instrumentality middlemarch in fact counted on swallowing lydgate and assimilating him very comfortably the question whether mr tyke should be appointed as salaried chaplain to the hospital was an exciting topic to the middlemarchers and lydgate heard it discussed in a way that threw much light on the power exercised in the town by mr bulstrode the banker was evidently a ruler but there was an opposition party and even among his supporters there were some who allowed it to be seen that their support was a compromise and who frankly stated their impression that the general scheme of things and especially the casualties of trade required you to hold a candle to the devil mr bulstrode s power was not due simply to his being a country banker who knew the financial secrets of most traders in the town and could touch the springs of their credit it was fortified by a beneficence that was at once ready and severe ready to confer obligations and severe in watching the result he had gathered as an industrious man always at his post a chief share in administering the town charities and his private charities were both minute and abundant he would take a great deal of pains about apprenticing tegg the shoemaker s son and he would watch over tegg s church going he would defend mrs strype the washerwoman against stubbs s unjust exaction on the score of her drying ground and he would himself scrutinize a calumny against mrs strype his private minor loans were numerous but he would inquire strictly into the circumstances both before and after in this way a man gathers a domain in his neighbors hope and fear as well as gratitude and power when once it has got into that subtle region propagates itself spreading out of all proportion to its external means it was a principle with mr bulstrode to gain as much power as possible that he might use it for the glory of god he went through a great deal of spiritual conflict and inward argument in order to adjust his motives and make clear to himself what god s glory required but as we have seen his motives were not always rightly appreciated there were many crass minds in middlemarch whose reflective scales could only weigh things in the lump and they had a strong suspicion that since mr bulstrode could not enjoy life in their fashion eating and drinking so little as he did and worreting himself about everything he must have a sort of vampire s feast in the sense of mastery the subject of the chaplaincy came up at mr vincy s table when lydgate was dining there and the family connection with mr bulstrode did not he observed prevent some freedom of remark even on the part of the host himself though his reasons against the proposed arrangement turned entirely on his objection to mr tyke s sermons which were all doctrine and his preference for mr farebrother whose sermons were free from that taint mr vincy liked well enough the notion of the chaplain s having a salary supposing it were given to farebrother who was as good a little fellow as ever breathed and the best preacher anywhere and companionable too what line shall you take then said mr chichely the coroner a great coursing comrade of mr vincy s oh i m precious glad i m not one of the directors now i shall vote for referring the matter to the directors and the medical board together i shall roll some of my responsibility on your shoulders doctor said mr vincy glancing first at dr sprague the senior physician of the town and then at lydgate who sat opposite you medical gentlemen must consult which sort of black draught you will prescribe eh mr lydgate i know little of either said lydgate but in general appointments are apt to be made too much a question of personal liking the fittest man for a particular post is not always the best fellow or the most agreeable sometimes if you wanted to get a reform your only way would be to pension off the good fellows whom everybody is fond of and put them out of the question dr sprague who was considered the physician of most weight though dr minchin was usually said to have more penetration divested his large heavy face of all expression and looked at his wine glass while lydgate was speaking whatever was not problematical and suspected about this young man for
GE(Mddlem...),oh mr lydgate you know well what your advantages are you know that our young men here cannot cope with you where you frequent a house it may militate very much against a girl s making a desirable settlement in life and prevent her from accepting offers even if they are made lydgate was less flattered by his advantage over the middlemarch orlandos than he was annoyed by the perception of mrs bulstrode s meaning she felt that she had spoken as impressively as it was necessary to do and that in using the superior word militate she had thrown a noble drapery over a mass of particulars which were still evident enough lydgate was fuming a little pushed his hair back with one hand felt curiously in his waistcoat pocket with the other and then stooped to beckon the tiny black spaniel which had the insight to decline his hollow caresses it would not have been decent to go away because he had been dining with other guests and had just taken tea but mrs bulstrode having no doubt that she had been understood turned the conversation solomon s proverbs i think have omitted to say that as the sore palate findeth grit so an uneasy consciousness heareth innuendoes the next day mr farebrother parting from lydgate in the street supposed that they should meet at vincy s in the evening lydgate answered curtly no he had work to do he must give up going out in the evening what you are going to get lashed to the mast eh and are stopping your ears said the vicar well if you don t mean to be won by the sirens you are right to take precautions in time a few days before lydgate would have taken no notice of these words as anything more than the vicar s usual way of putting things they seemed now to convey an innuendo which confirmed the impression that he had been making a fool of himself and behaving so as to be misunderstood not he believed by rosamond herself she he felt sure took everything as lightly as he intended it she had an exquisite tact and insight in relation to all points of manners but the people she lived among were blunderers and busybodies however the mistake should go no farther he resolved and kept his resolution that he would not go to mr vincy s except on business rosamond became very unhappy the uneasiness first stirred by her aunt s questions grew and grew till at the end of ten days that she had not seen lydgate it grew into terror at the blank that might possibly come into foreboding of that ready fatal sponge which so cheaply wipes out the hopes of mortals the world would have a new dreariness for her as a wilderness that a magician s spells had turned for a little while into a garden she felt that she was beginning to know the pang of disappointed love and that no other man could be the occasion of such delightful aerial building as she had been enjoying for the last six months poor rosamond lost her appetite and felt as forlorn as ariadne as a charming stage ariadne left behind with all her boxes full of costumes and no hope of a coach there are many wonderful mixtures in the world which are all alike called love and claim the privileges of a sublime rage which is an apology for everything in literature and the drama happily rosamond did not think of committing any desperate act she plaited her fair hair as beautifully as usual and kept herself proudly calm her most cheerful supposition was that her aunt bulstrode had interfered in some way to hinder lydgate s visits everything was better than a spontaneous indifference in him any one who imagines ten days too short a time not for falling into leanness lightness or other measurable effects of passion but for the whole spiritual circuit of alarmed conjecture and disappointment is ignorant of what can go on in the elegant leisure of a young lady s mind on the eleventh day however lydgate when leaving stone court was requested by mrs vincy to let her husband know that there was a marked change in mr featherstone s health and that she wished him to come to stone court on that day now lydgate might have called at the warehouse or might have written a message on a leaf of his pocket book and left it at the door yet these simple devices apparently did not occur to him from which we may conclude that he had no strong objection to calling at the house at an hour when mr vincy was not at home and leaving the message with miss vincy a man may from various motives decline to give his company but perhaps not even a sage would be gratified that nobody missed him it would be a graceful easy way of piecing on the new habits to the old to have a few playful words with rosamond about his resistance to dissipation and his firm resolve to take long fasts even from sweet sounds it must be confessed also that momentary speculations as to all the possible grounds for mrs bulstrode s hints had managed to get woven like slight clinging hairs into the more substantial web of his thoughts miss vincy was alone and blushed so deeply when lydgate came in that he felt a corresponding embarrassment and instead of any playfulness he began at once to speak of his reason for calling and to beg her almost formally to deliver the message to her father rosamond who at the first moment felt as if her happiness were returning was keenly hurt by lydgate s manner her blush had departed and she assented coldly without adding an unnecessary word some trivial chain work which she had in her hands enabling her to avoid looking at lydgate higher than his chin in all failures the beginning is certainly the half of the whole after sitting two long moments while he moved his whip and could say nothing lydgate rose to go and rosamond made nervous by her struggle between mortification and the wish not to betray it dropped her chain as if startled and rose too mechanically lydgate instantaneously stooped to pick up the chain when he rose he was very near to a lovely little face set on a fair long neck which he had been used to see turning about under the most perfect management of self contented grace but as he raised his eyes now he saw a certain helpless quivering which touched him quite newly and made him look at rosamond with a questioning flash at this moment she was as natural as she had ever been when she was five years old she felt that her tears had risen and it was no use to try to do anything else than let them stay like water on a blue flower or let them fall over her cheeks even as they would that moment of naturalness was the crystallizing feather touch it shook flirtation into love remember that the ambitious man who was looking at those forget me nots under the water was very warm hearted and rash he did not know where the chain went an idea had thrilled through the recesses within him which had a miraculous effect in raising the power of passionate love lying buried there in no sealed sepulchre but under the lightest easily pierced mould his words were quite abrupt and awkward but the tone made them sound like an ardent appealing avowal what is the matter you are distressed tell me pray rosamond had never been spoken to in such tones before i am not sure that she knew what the words were but she looked at lydgate and the tears fell over her cheeks there could have been no more complete answer than that silence and lydgate forgetting everything else completely mastered by the outrush of tenderness at the sudden belief that this sweet young creature depended on him for her joy actually put his arms round her folding her gently and protectingly he was used to being gentle with the weak and suffering and kissed each of the two large tears this was a strange way of arriving at an understanding but it was a short way rosamond was not angry but she moved backward a little in timid happiness and lydgate could now sit near her and speak less incompletely rosamond had to make her little confession and he poured out words of gratitude and tenderness with impulsive lavishment in half an hour he left the house an engaged man whose soul was not his own but the woman s to whom he had bound himself he came again in the evening to speak with mr vincy who just returned from stone court was feeling sure that it would not be long before he heard of mr featherstone s demise the felicitous word demise which had seasonably occurred to him had raised his spirits even above their usual evening pitch the right word is always a power and communicates its definiteness to our action considered as a demise old featherstone s death assumed a merely legal aspect so that mr vincy could tap his snuff box over it and be jovial without even an intermittent affectation of solemnity and mr vincy hated both solemnity and affectation who was ever awe struck about a testator or sang a hymn on the title to real property mr vincy was inclined to take a jovial view of all things that evening he even observed to lydgate that fred had got the family constitution after all and would soon be as fine a fellow as ever again and when his approbation of rosamond s engagement was asked for he gave it with astonishing facility passing at once to general remarks on the desirableness of matrimony for young men and maidens and apparently deducing from the whole the appropriateness of a little more punch the triumphant confidence of the mayor founded on mr featherstone s insistent demand that fred and his mother should not leave him was a feeble emotion compared with all that was agitating the breasts of the old man s blood relations who naturally manifested more their sense of the family tie and were more visibly numerous now that he had become bedridden naturally for when poor peter had occupied his arm chair in the wainscoted parlor no assiduous beetles for whom the cook prepares boiling water could have been less welcome on a hearth which they had reasons for preferring than those persons whose featherstone blood was ill nourished not from penuriousness on their part but from poverty brother solomon and sister jane were rich and the family candor and total abstinence from false politeness with which they were always received seemed to them no argument that their brother in the solemn act of making his will would overlook the superior claims of wealth themselves at least he had never been unnatural enough to banish from his house and it seemed hardly eccentric that he should have kept away brother jonah sister martha and the rest who had no shadow of such claims they knew peter s maxim that money was a good egg and should be laid in a warm nest but brother jonah sister martha and all the needy exiles held a different point of view probabilities are as various as the faces to be seen at will in fretwork or paper hangings every form is there from jupiter to judy if you only look with creative inclination to the poorer and least favored it seemed likely that since peter had done nothing for them in his life he would remember them at the last jonah argued that men liked to make a surprise of their wills while martha said that nobody need be surprised if he left the best part of his money to those who least expected it also it was not to be thought but that an own brother lying there with dropsy in his legs must come to feel that blood was thicker than water and if he didn t alter his will he might have money by him at any rate some blood relations should be on the premises and on the watch against those who were hardly relations at all such things had been known as forged wills and disputed wills which seemed to have the golden hazy advantage of somehow enabling non legatees to live out of them again those who were no blood relations might be caught making away with things and poor peter lying there helpless somebody should be on the watch but in this conclusion they were at one with solomon and jane also some nephews nieces and cousins arguing with still greater subtilty as to what might be done by a man able to will away his property and give himself large treats of oddity felt in a handsome sort of way that there was a family interest to be attended to and thought of stone court as a place which it would be nothing but right for them to visit sister martha otherwise mrs cranch living with some wheeziness in the chalky flats could not undertake the journey but her son as being poor peter s own nephew could represent her advantageously and watch lest his uncle jonah should make an unfair use of the improbable things which seemed likely to happen in fact there was a general sense running in the featherstone blood that everybody must watch everybody else and that it would be well for everybody else to reflect that the almighty was watching him thus stone court continually saw one or other blood relation alighting or departing and mary garth had the unpleasant task of carrying their messages to mr featherstone who would see none of them and sent her down with the still more unpleasant task of telling them so as manager of the household she felt bound to ask them in good provincial fashion to stay and eat but she chose to consult mrs vincy on the point of extra down stairs consumption now that mr featherstone was laid up oh my dear you must do things handsomely where there s last illness and a property god knows i don t grudge them every ham in the house only save the best for the funeral have some stuffed veal always and a fine cheese in cut you must expect to keep open house in these last illnesses said liberal mrs vincy once more of cheerful note and bright plumage but some of the visitors alighted and did not depart after the handsome treating to veal and ham brother jonah for example there are such unpleasant people in most families perhaps even in the highest aristocracy there are brobdingnag specimens gigantically in debt and bloated at greater expense brother jonah i say having come down in the world was mainly supported by a calling which he was modest enough not to boast of though it was much better than swindling either on exchange or turf but which did not require his presence at brassing so long as he had a good corner to sit in and a supply of food he chose the kitchen corner partly because he liked it best and partly because he did not want to sit with solomon concerning whom he had a strong brotherly opinion seated in a famous arm chair and in his best suit constantly within sight of good cheer he had a comfortable consciousness of being on the premises mingled with fleeting suggestions of sunday and the bar at the green man and he informed mary garth that he should not go out of reach of his brother peter while that poor fellow was above ground the troublesome ones in a family are usually either the wits or the idiots jonah was the wit among the featherstones and joked with the maid servants when they came about the hearth but seemed to consider miss garth a suspicious character and followed her with cold eyes mary would have borne this one pair of eyes with comparative ease but unfortunately there was young cranch who having come all the way from the chalky flats to represent his mother and watch his uncle jonah also felt it his duty to stay and to sit chiefly in the kitchen to give his uncle company young cranch was not exactly the balancing point between the wit and the idiot verging slightly towards the latter type and squinting so as to leave everything in doubt about his sentiments except that they were not of a forcible character when mary garth entered the kitchen and mr jonah featherstone began to follow her with his cold detective eyes young cranch turning his head in the same direction seemed to insist on it that she should remark how he was squinting as if he did it with design like the gypsies when borrow read the new testament to them this was rather too much for poor mary sometimes it made her bilious sometimes it upset her gravity one day that she had an opportunity she could not resist describing the kitchen scene to fred who would not be hindered from immediately going to see it affecting simply to pass through but no sooner did he face the four eyes than he had to rush through the nearest door which happened to lead to the dairy and there under the high roof and among the pans he gave way to laughter which made a hollow resonance perfectly audible in the kitchen he fled by another doorway but mr jonah who had not before seen fred s white complexion long legs and pinched delicacy of face prepared many sarcasms in which these points of appearance were wittily combined with the lowest moral attributes why tom you don t wear such gentlemanly trousers you haven t got half such fine long legs said jonah to his nephew winking at the same time to imply that there was something more in these statements than their undeniableness tom looked at his legs but left it uncertain whether he preferred his moral advantages to a more vicious length of limb and reprehensible gentility of trouser in the large wainscoted parlor too there were constantly pairs of eyes on the watch and own relatives eager to be sitters up many came lunched and departed but brother solomon and the lady who had been jane featherstone for twenty five years before she was mrs waule found it good to be there every day for hours without other calculable occupation than that of observing the cunning mary garth who was so deep that she could be found out in nothing and giving occasional dry wrinkly indications of crying as if capable of torrents in a wetter season at the thought that they were not allowed to go into mr featherstone s room for the old man s dislike of his own family seemed to get stronger as he got less able to amuse himself by saying biting things to them too languid to sting he had the more venom refluent in his blood not fully believing the message sent through mary garth they had presented themselves together within the door of the bedroom both in black mrs waule having a white handkerchief partially unfolded in her hand and both with faces in a sort of half mourning purple while mrs vincy with her pink cheeks and pink ribbons flying was actually administering a cordial to their own brother and the light complexioned fred his short hair curling as might be expected in a gambler s was lolling at his ease in a large chair old featherstone no sooner caught sight of these funereal figures appearing in spite of his orders than rage came to strengthen him more successfully than the cordial he was propped up on a bed rest and always had his gold headed stick lying by him he seized it now and swept it backwards and forwards in as large an area as he could apparently to ban these ugly spectres crying in a hoarse sort of screech back back mrs waule back solomon oh brother peter mrs waule began but solomon put his hand before her repressingly he was a large cheeked man nearly seventy with small furtive eyes and was not only of much blander temper but thought himself much deeper than his brother peter indeed not likely to be deceived in any of his fellow men inasmuch as they could not well be more greedy and deceitful than he suspected them of being even the invisible powers he thought were likely to be soothed by a bland parenthesis here and there coming from a man of property who might have been as impious as others brother peter he said in a wheedling yet gravely official tone it s nothing but right i should speak to you about the three crofts and the manganese the almighty knows what i ve got on my mind then he knows more than i want to know said peter laying down his stick with a show of truce which had a threat in it too for he reversed the stick so as to make the gold handle a club in case of closer fighting and looked hard at solomon s bald head there s things you might repent of brother for want of speaking to me said solomon not advancing however i could sit up with you to night and jane with me willingly and you might take your own time to speak or let me speak yes i shall take my own time you needn t offer me yours said peter but you can t take your own time to die in brother began mrs waule with her usual woolly tone and when you lie speechless you may be tired of having strangers about you and you may think of me and my children but here her voice broke under the touching thought which she was attributing to her speechless brother the mention of ourselves being naturally affecting no i shan t said old featherstone contradictiously i shan t think of any of you i ve made my will i tell you i ve made my will here he turned his head towards mrs vincy and swallowed some more of his cordial some people would be ashamed to fill up a place belonging by rights to others said mrs waule turning her narrow eyes in the same direction oh sister said solomon with ironical softness you and me are not fine and handsome and clever enough we must be humble and let smart people push themselves before us fred s spirit could not bear this rising and looking at mr featherstone he said shall my mother and i leave the room sir that you may be alone with your friends sit down i tell you said old featherstone snappishly stop where you are good by solomon he added trying to wield his stick again but failing now that he had reversed the handle good by mrs waule don t you come again i shall be down stairs brother whether or no said solomon i shall do my duty and it remains to be seen what the almighty will allow yes in property going out of families said mrs waule in continuation and where there s steady young men to carry on but i pity them who are not such and i pity their mothers good by brother peter remember i m the eldest after you brother and prospered from the
GE(Mddlem...),and liked to give others their due feeling that he could afford it he had caught the words expectant method and rang chimes on this and other learned phrases to accompany the assurance that lydgate knew a thing or two more than the rest of the doctors was far better versed in the secrets of his profession than the majority of his compeers this had happened before the affair of fred vincy s illness had given to mr wrench s enmity towards lydgate more definite personal ground the new comer already threatened to be a nuisance in the shape of rivalry and was certainly a nuisance in the shape of practical criticism or reflections on his hard driven elders who had had something else to do than to busy themselves with untried notions his practice had spread in one or two quarters and from the first the report of his high family had led to his being pretty generally invited so that the other medical men had to meet him at dinner in the best houses and having to meet a man whom you dislike is not observed always to end in a mutual attachment there was hardly ever so much unanimity among them as in the opinion that lydgate was an arrogant young fellow and yet ready for the sake of ultimately predominating to show a crawling subservience to bulstrode that mr farebrother whose name was a chief flag of the anti bulstrode party always defended lydgate and made a friend of him was referred to farebrother s unaccountable way of fighting on both sides here was plenty of preparation for the outburst of professional disgust at the announcement of the laws mr bulstrode was laying down for the direction of the new hospital which were the more exasperating because there was no present possibility of interfering with his will and pleasure everybody except lord medlicote having refused help towards the building on the ground that they preferred giving to the old infirmary mr bulstrode met all the expenses and had ceased to be sorry that he was purchasing the right to carry out his notions of improvement without hindrance from prejudiced coadjutors but he had had to spend large sums and the building had lingered caleb garth had undertaken it had failed during its progress and before the interior fittings were begun had retired from the management of the business and when referring to the hospital he often said that however bulstrode might ring if you tried him he liked good solid carpentry and masonry and had a notion both of drains and chimneys in fact the hospital had become an object of intense interest to bulstrode and he would willingly have continued to spare a large yearly sum that he might rule it dictatorially without any board but he had another favorite object which also required money for its accomplishment he wished to buy some land in the neighborhood of middlemarch and therefore he wished to get considerable contributions towards maintaining the hospital meanwhile he framed his plan of management the hospital was to be reserved for fever in all its forms lydgate was to be chief medical superintendent that he might have free authority to pursue all comparative investigations which his studies particularly in paris had shown him the importance of the other medical visitors having a consultative influence but no power to contravene lydgate s ultimate decisions and the general management was to be lodged exclusively in the hands of five directors associated with mr bulstrode who were to have votes in the ratio of their contributions the board itself filling up any vacancy in its numbers and no mob of small contributors being admitted to a share of government there was an immediate refusal on the part of every medical man in the town to become a visitor at the fever hospital very well said lydgate to mr bulstrode we have a capital house surgeon and dispenser a clear headed neat handed fellow we ll get webbe from crabsley as good a country practitioner as any of them to come over twice a week and in case of any exceptional operation protheroe will come from brassing i must work the harder that s all and i have given up my post at the infirmary the plan will flourish in spite of them and then they ll be glad to come in things can t last as they are there must be all sorts of reform soon and then young fellows may be glad to come and study here lydgate was in high spirits i shall not flinch you may depend upon it mr lydgate said mr bulstrode while i see you carrying out high intentions with vigor you shall have my unfailing support and i have humble confidence that the blessing which has hitherto attended my efforts against the spirit of evil in this town will not be withdrawn suitable directors to assist me i have no doubt of securing mr brooke of tipton has already given me his concurrence and a pledge to contribute yearly he has not specified the sum probably not a great one but he will be a useful member of the board a useful member was perhaps to be defined as one who would originate nothing and always vote with mr bulstrode the medical aversion to lydgate was hardly disguised now neither dr sprague nor dr minchin said that he disliked lydgate s knowledge or his disposition to improve treatment what they disliked was his arrogance which nobody felt to be altogether deniable they implied that he was insolent pretentious and given to that reckless innovation for the sake of noise and show which was the essence of the charlatan the word charlatan once thrown on the air could not be let drop in those days the world was agitated about the wondrous doings of mr st john long noblemen and gentlemen attesting his extraction of a fluid like mercury from the temples of a patient mr toller remarked one day smilingly to mrs taft that bulstrode had found a man to suit him in lydgate a charlatan in religion is sure to like other sorts of charlatans yes indeed i can imagine said mrs taft keeping the number of thirty stitches carefully in her mind all the while there are so many of that sort i remember mr cheshire with his irons trying to make people straight when the almighty had made them crooked no no said mr toller cheshire was all right all fair and above board but there s st john long that s the kind of fellow we call a charlatan advertising cures in ways nobody knows anything about a fellow who wants to make a noise by pretending to go deeper than other people the other day he was pretending to tap a man s brain and get quicksilver out of it good gracious what dreadful trifling with people s constitutions said mrs taft after this it came to be held in various quarters that lydgate played even with respectable constitutions for his own purposes and how much more likely that in his flighty experimenting he should make sixes and sevens of hospital patients especially it was to be expected as the landlady of the tankard had said that he would recklessly cut up their dead bodies for lydgate having attended mrs goby who died apparently of a heart disease not very clearly expressed in the symptoms too daringly asked leave of her relatives to open the body and thus gave an offence quickly spreading beyond parley street where that lady had long resided on an income such as made this association of her body with the victims of burke and hare a flagrant insult to her memory affairs were in this stage when lydgate opened the subject of the hospital to dorothea we see that he was bearing enmity and silly misconception with much spirit aware that they were partly created by his good share of success they will not drive me away he said talking confidentially in mr farebrother s study i have got a good opportunity here for the ends i care most about and i am pretty sure to get income enough for our wants by and by i shall go on as quietly as possible i have no seductions now away from home and work and i am more and more convinced that it will be possible to demonstrate the homogeneous origin of all the tissues raspail and others are on the same track and i have been losing time i have no power of prophecy there said mr farebrother who had been puffing at his pipe thoughtfully while lydgate talked but as to the hostility in the town you ll weather it if you are prudent how am i to be prudent said lydgate i just do what comes before me to do i can t help people s ignorance and spite any more than vesalius could it isn t possible to square one s conduct to silly conclusions which nobody can foresee quite true i didn t mean that i meant only two things one is keep yourself as separable from bulstrode as you can of course you can go on doing good work of your own by his help but don t get tied perhaps it seems like personal feeling in me to say so and there s a good deal of that i own but personal feeling is not always in the wrong if you boil it down to the impressions which make it simply an opinion bulstrode is nothing to me said lydgate carelessly except on public grounds as to getting very closely united to him i am not fond enough of him for that but what was the other thing you meant said lydgate who was nursing his leg as comfortably as possible and feeling in no great need of advice why this take care experto crede take care not to get hampered about money matters i know by a word you let fall one day that you don t like my playing at cards so much for money you are right enough there but try and keep clear of wanting small sums that you haven t got i am perhaps talking rather superfluously but a man likes to assume superiority over himself by holding up his bad example and sermonizing on it lydgate took mr farebrother s hints very cordially though he would hardly have borne them from another man he could not help remembering that he had lately made some debts but these had seemed inevitable and he had no intention now to do more than keep house in a simple way the furniture for which he owed would not want renewing nor even the stock of wine for a long while many thoughts cheered him at that time and justly a man conscious of enthusiasm for worthy aims is sustained under petty hostilities by the memory of great workers who had to fight their way not without wounds and who hover in his mind as patron saints invisibly helping at home that same evening when he had been chatting with mr farebrother he had his long legs stretched on the sofa his head thrown back and his hands clasped behind it according to his favorite ruminating attitude while rosamond sat at the piano and played one tune after another of which her husband only knew like the emotional elephant he was that they fell in with his mood as if they had been melodious sea breezes there was something very fine in lydgate s look just then and any one might have been encouraged to bet on his achievement in his dark eyes and on his mouth and brow there was that placidity which comes from the fulness of contemplative thought the mind not searching but beholding and the glance seeming to be filled with what is behind it presently rosamond left the piano and seated herself on a chair close to the sofa and opposite her husband s face is that enough music for you my lord she said folding her hands before her and putting on a little air of meekness yes dear if you are tired said lydgate gently turning his eyes and resting them on her but not otherwise moving rosamond s presence at that moment was perhaps no more than a spoonful brought to the lake and her woman s instinct in this matter was not dull what is absorbing you she said leaning forward and bringing her face nearer to his he moved his hands and placed them gently behind her shoulders i am thinking of a great fellow who was about as old as i am three hundred years ago and had already begun a new era in anatomy i can t guess said rosamond shaking her head we used to play at guessing historical characters at mrs lemon s but not anatomists i ll tell you his name was vesalius and the only way he could get to know anatomy as he did was by going to snatch bodies at night from graveyards and places of execution oh said rosamond with a look of disgust on her pretty face i am very glad you are not vesalius i should have thought he might find some less horrible way than that no he couldn t said lydgate going on too earnestly to take much notice of her answer he could only get a complete skeleton by snatching the whitened bones of a criminal from the gallows and burying them and fetching them away by bits secretly in the dead of night i hope he is not one of your great heroes said rosamond half playfully half anxiously else i shall have you getting up in the night to go to st peter s churchyard you know how angry you told me the people were about mrs goby you have enemies enough already so had vesalius rosy no wonder the medical fogies in middlemarch are jealous when some of the greatest doctors living were fierce upon vesalius because they had believed in galen and he showed that galen was wrong they called him a liar and a poisonous monster but the facts of the human frame were on his side and so he got the better of them and what happened to him afterwards said rosamond with some interest oh he had a good deal of fighting to the last and they did exasperate him enough at one time to make him burn a good deal of his work then he got shipwrecked just as he was coming from jerusalem to take a great chair at padua he died rather miserably there was a moment s pause before rosamond said do you know tertius i often wish you had not been a medical man nay rosy don t say that said lydgate drawing her closer to him that is like saying you wish you had married another man not at all you are clever enough for anything you might easily have been something else and your cousins at quallingham all think that you have sunk below them in your choice of a profession the cousins at quallingham may go to the devil said lydgate with scorn it was like their impudence if they said anything of the sort to you still said rosamond i do not think it is a nice profession dear we know that she had much quiet perseverance in her opinion it is the grandest profession in the world rosamond said lydgate gravely and to say that you love me without loving the medical man in me is the same sort of thing as to say that you like eating a peach but don t like its flavor don t say that again dear it pains me very well doctor grave face said rosy dimpling i will declare in future that i dote on skeletons and body snatchers and bits of things in phials and quarrels with everybody that end in your dying miserably no no not so bad as that said lydgate giving up remonstrance and petting her resignedly while lydgate safely married and with the hospital under his command felt himself struggling for medical reform against middlemarch middlemarch was becoming more and more conscious of the national struggle for another kind of reform by the time that lord john russell s measure was being debated in the house of commons there was a new political animation in middlemarch and a new definition of parties which might show a decided change of balance if a new election came and there were some who already predicted this event declaring that a reform bill would never be carried by the actual parliament this was what will ladislaw dwelt on to mr brooke as a reason for congratulation that he had not yet tried his strength at the hustings things will grow and ripen as if it were a comet year said will the public temper will soon get to a cometary heat now the question of reform has set in there is likely to be another election before long and by that time middlemarch will have got more ideas into its head what we have to work at now is the pioneer and political meetings quite right ladislaw we shall make a new thing of opinion here said mr brooke only i want to keep myself independent about reform you know i don t want to go too far i want to take up wilberforce s and romilly s line you know and work at negro emancipation criminal law that kind of thing but of course i should support grey if you go in for the principle of reform you must be prepared to take what the situation offers said will if everybody pulled for his own bit against everybody else the whole question would go to tatters yes yes i agree with you i quite take that point of view i should put it in that light i should support grey you know but i don t want to change the balance of the constitution and i don t think grey would but that is what the country wants said will else there would be no meaning in political unions or any other movement that knows what it s about it wants to have a house of commons which is not weighted with nominees of the landed class but with representatives of the other interests and as to contending for a reform short of that it is like asking for a bit of an avalanche which has already begun to thunder that is fine ladislaw that is the way to put it write that down now we must begin to get documents about the feeling of the country as well as the machine breaking and general distress as to documents said will a two inch card will hold plenty a few rows of figures are enough to deduce misery from and a few more will show the rate at which the political determination of the people is growing good draw that out a little more at length ladislaw that is an idea now write it out in the pioneer put the figures and deduce the misery you know and put the other figures and deduce and so on you have a way of putting things burke now when i think of burke i can t help wishing somebody had a pocket borough to give you ladislaw you d never get elected you know and we shall always want talent in the house reform as we will we shall always want talent that avalanche and the thunder now was really a little like burke i want that sort of thing not ideas you know but a way of putting them pocket boroughs would be a fine thing said ladislaw if they were always in the right pocket and there were always a burke at hand will was not displeased with that complimentary comparison even from mr brooke for it is a little too trying to human flesh to be conscious of expressing one s self better than others and never to have it noticed and in the general dearth of admiration for the right thing even a chance bray of applause falling exactly in time is rather fortifying will felt that his literary refinements were usually beyond the limits of middlemarch perception nevertheless he was beginning thoroughly to like the work of which when he began he had said to himself rather languidly why not and he studied the political situation with as ardent an interest as he had ever given to poetic metres or mediaevalism it is undeniable that but for the desire to be where dorothea was and perhaps the want of knowing what else to do will would not at this time have been meditating on the needs of the english people or criticising english statesmanship he would probably have been rambling in italy sketching plans for several dramas trying prose and finding it too jejune trying verse and finding it too artificial beginning to copy bits from old pictures leaving off because they were no good and observing that after all self culture was the principal point while in politics he would have been sympathizing warmly with liberty and progress in general our sense of duty must often wait for some work which shall take the place of dilettanteism and make us feel that the quality of our action is not a matter of indifference ladislaw had now accepted his bit of work though it was not that indeterminate loftiest thing which he had once dreamed of as alone worthy of continuous effort his nature warmed easily in the presence of subjects which were visibly mixed with life and action and the easily stirred rebellion in him helped the glow of public spirit in spite of mr casaubon and the banishment from lowick he was rather happy getting a great deal of fresh knowledge in a vivid way and for practical purposes and making the pioneer celebrated as far as brassing never mind the smallness of the area the writing was not worse than much that reaches the four corners of the earth mr brooke was occasionally irritating but will s impatience was relieved by the division of his time between visits to the grange and retreats to his middlemarch lodgings which gave variety to his life shift the pegs a little he said to himself and mr brooke might be in the cabinet while i was under secretary that is the common order of things the little waves make the large ones and are of the same pattern i am better here than in the sort of life mr casaubon would have trained me for where the doing would be all laid down by a precedent too rigid for me to react upon i don t care for prestige or high pay as lydgate had said of him he was a sort of gypsy rather enjoying the sense of belonging to no class he had a feeling of romance in his position and a pleasant consciousness of creating a little surprise wherever he went that sort of enjoyment had been disturbed when he had felt some new distance between himself and dorothea in their accidental meeting at lydgate s and his irritation had gone out towards mr casaubon who had declared beforehand that will would lose caste i never had any caste he would have said if that prophecy had been uttered to him and the quick blood would have come and gone like breath in his transparent skin but it is one thing to like defiance and another thing to like its consequences meanwhile the town
GE(Mddlem...),with those words uttered impetuously will rose put out his hand to rosamond still with the air of a somnambulist and went away when he was gone rosamond left her chair and walked to the other end of the room leaning when she got there against a chiffonniere and looking out of the window wearily she was oppressed by ennui and by that dissatisfaction which in women s minds is continually turning into a trivial jealousy referring to no real claims springing from no deeper passion than the vague exactingness of egoism and yet capable of impelling action as well as speech there really is nothing to care for much said poor rosamond inwardly thinking of the family at quallingham who did not write to her and that perhaps tertius when he came home would tease her about expenses she had already secretly disobeyed him by asking her father to help them and he had ended decisively by saying i am more likely to want help myself a few days afterwards it was already the end of august there was an occasion which caused some excitement in middlemarch the public if it chose was to have the advantage of buying under the distinguished auspices of mr borthrop trumbull the furniture books and pictures which anybody might see by the handbills to be the best in every kind belonging to edwin larcher esq this was not one of the sales indicating the depression of trade on the contrary it was due to mr larcher s great success in the carrying business which warranted his purchase of a mansion near riverston already furnished in high style by an illustrious spa physician furnished indeed with such large framefuls of expensive flesh painting in the dining room that mrs larcher was nervous until reassured by finding the subjects to be scriptural hence the fine opportunity to purchasers which was well pointed out in the handbills of mr borthrop trumbull whose acquaintance with the history of art enabled him to state that the hall furniture to be sold without reserve comprised a piece of carving by a contemporary of gibbons at middlemarch in those times a large sale was regarded as a kind of festival there was a table spread with the best cold eatables as at a superior funeral and facilities were offered for that generous drinking of cheerful glasses which might lead to generous and cheerful bidding for undesirable articles mr larcher s sale was the more attractive in the fine weather because the house stood just at the end of the town with a garden and stables attached in that pleasant issue from middlemarch called the london road which was also the road to the new hospital and to mr bulstrode s retired residence known as the shrubs in short the auction was as good as a fair and drew all classes with leisure at command to some who risked making bids in order simply to raise prices it was almost equal to betting at the races the second day when the best furniture was to be sold everybody was there even mr thesiger the rector of st peter s had looked in for a short time wishing to buy the carved table and had rubbed elbows with mr bambridge and mr horrock there was a wreath of middlemarch ladies accommodated with seats round the large table in the dining room where mr borthrop trumbull was mounted with desk and hammer but the rows chiefly of masculine faces behind were often varied by incomings and outgoings both from the door and the large bow window opening on to the lawn everybody that day did not include mr bulstrode whose health could not well endure crowds and draughts but mrs bulstrode had particularly wished to have a certain picture a supper at emmaus attributed in the catalogue to guido and at the last moment before the day of the sale mr bulstrode had called at the office of the pioneer of which he was now one of the proprietors to beg of mr ladislaw as a great favor that he would obligingly use his remarkable knowledge of pictures on behalf of mrs bulstrode and judge of the value of this particular painting if added the scrupulously polite banker attendance at the sale would not interfere with the arrangements for your departure which i know is imminent this proviso might have sounded rather satirically in will s ear if he had been in a mood to care about such satire it referred to an understanding entered into many weeks before with the proprietors of the paper that he should be at liberty any day he pleased to hand over the management to the subeditor whom he had been training since he wished finally to quit middlemarch but indefinite visions of ambition are weak against the ease of doing what is habitual or beguilingly agreeable and we all know the difficulty of carrying out a resolve when we secretly long that it may turn out to be unnecessary in such states of mind the most incredulous person has a private leaning towards miracle impossible to conceive how our wish could be fulfilled still very wonderful things have happened will did not confess this weakness to himself but he lingered what was the use of going to london at that time of the year the rugby men who would remember him were not there and so far as political writing was concerned he would rather for a few weeks go on with the pioneer at the present moment however when mr bulstrode was speaking to him he had both a strengthened resolve to go and an equally strong resolve not to go till he had once more seen dorothea hence he replied that he had reasons for deferring his departure a little and would be happy to go to the sale will was in a defiant mood his consciousness being deeply stung with the thought that the people who looked at him probably knew a fact tantamount to an accusation against him as a fellow with low designs which were to be frustrated by a disposal of property like most people who assert their freedom with regard to conventional distinction he was prepared to be sudden and quick at quarrel with any one who might hint that he had personal reasons for that assertion that there was anything in his blood his bearing or his character to which he gave the mask of an opinion when he was under an irritating impression of this kind he would go about for days with a defiant look the color changing in his transparent skin as if he were on the qui vive watching for something which he had to dart upon this expression was peculiarly noticeable in him at the sale and those who had only seen him in his moods of gentle oddity or of bright enjoyment would have been struck with a contrast he was not sorry to have this occasion for appearing in public before the middlemarch tribes of toller hackbutt and the rest who looked down on him as an adventurer and were in a state of brutal ignorance about dante who sneered at his polish blood and were themselves of a breed very much in need of crossing he stood in a conspicuous place not far from the auctioneer with a fore finger in each side pocket and his head thrown backward not caring to speak to anybody though he had been cordially welcomed as a connoiss ure by mr trumbull who was enjoying the utmost activity of his great faculties and surely among all men whose vocation requires them to exhibit their powers of speech the happiest is a prosperous provincial auctioneer keenly alive to his own jokes and sensible of his encyclopedic knowledge some saturnine sour blooded persons might object to be constantly insisting on the merits of all articles from boot jacks to berghems but mr borthrop trumbull had a kindly liquid in his veins he was an admirer by nature and would have liked to have the universe under his hammer feeling that it would go at a higher figure for his recommendation meanwhile mrs larcher s drawing room furniture was enough for him when will ladislaw had come in a second fender said to have been forgotten in its right place suddenly claimed the auctioneer s enthusiasm which he distributed on the equitable principle of praising those things most which were most in need of praise the fender was of polished steel with much lancet shaped open work and a sharp edge now ladies said he i shall appeal to you here is a fender which at any other sale would hardly be offered with out reserve being as i may say for quality of steel and quaintness of design a kind of thing here mr trumbull dropped his voice and became slightly nasal trimming his outlines with his left finger that might not fall in with ordinary tastes allow me to tell you that by and by this style of workmanship will be the only one in vogue half a crown you said thank you going at half a crown this characteristic fender and i have particular information that the antique style is very much sought after in high quarters three shillings three and sixpence hold it well up joseph look ladies at the chastity of the design i have no doubt myself that it was turned out in the last century four shillings mr mawmsey four shillings it s not a thing i would put in my drawing room said mrs mawmsey audibly for the warning of the rash husband i wonder at mrs larcher every blessed child s head that fell against it would be cut in two the edge is like a knife quite true rejoined mr trumbull quickly and most uncommonly useful to have a fender at hand that will cut if you have a leather shoe tie or a bit of string that wants cutting and no knife at hand many a man has been left hanging because there was no knife to cut him down gentlemen here s a fender that if you had the misfortune to hang yourselves would cut you down in no time with astonishing celerity four and sixpence five five and sixpence an appropriate thing for a spare bedroom where there was a four poster and a guest a little out of his mind six shillings thank you mr clintup going at six shillings going gone the auctioneer s glance which had been searching round him with a preternatural susceptibility to all signs of bidding here dropped on the paper before him and his voice too dropped into a tone of indifferent despatch as he said mr clintup be handy joseph it was worth six shillings to have a fender you could always tell that joke on said mr clintup laughing low and apologetically to his next neighbor he was a diffident though distinguished nurseryman and feared that the audience might regard his bid as a foolish one meanwhile joseph had brought a trayful of small articles now ladies said mr trumbull taking up one of the articles this tray contains a very recherchy lot a collection of trifles for the drawing room table and trifles make the sum of human things nothing more important than trifles yes mr ladislaw yes by and by but pass the tray round joseph these bijoux must be examined ladies this i have in my hand is an ingenious contrivance a sort of practical rebus i may call it here you see it looks like an elegant heart shaped box portable for the pocket there again it becomes like a splendid double flower an ornament for the table and now mr trumbull allowed the flower to fall alarmingly into strings of heart shaped leaves a book of riddles no less than five hundred printed in a beautiful red gentlemen if i had less of a conscience i should not wish you to bid high for this lot i have a longing for it myself what can promote innocent mirth and i may say virtue more than a good riddle it hinders profane language and attaches a man to the society of refined females this ingenious article itself without the elegant domino box card basket c ought alone to give a high price to the lot carried in the pocket it might make an individual welcome in any society four shillings sir four shillings for this remarkable collection of riddles with the et caeteras here is a sample how must you spell honey to make it catch lady birds answer money you hear lady birds honey money this is an amusement to sharpen the intellect it has a sting it has what we call satire and wit without indecency four and sixpence five shillings the bidding ran on with warming rivalry mr bowyer was a bidder and this was too exasperating bowyer couldn t afford it and only wanted to hinder every other man from making a figure the current carried even mr horrock with it but this committal of himself to an opinion fell from him with so little sacrifice of his neutral expression that the bid might not have been detected as his but for the friendly oaths of mr bambridge who wanted to know what horrock would do with blasted stuff only fit for haberdashers given over to that state of perdition which the horse dealer so cordially recognized in the majority of earthly existences the lot was finally knocked down at a guinea to mr spilkins a young slender of the neighborhood who was reckless with his pocket money and felt his want of memory for riddles come trumbull this is too bad you ve been putting some old maid s rubbish into the sale murmured mr toller getting close to the auctioneer i want to see how the prints go and i must be off soon im mediately mr toller it was only an act of benevolence which your noble heart would approve joseph quick with the prints lot 235 now gentlemen you who are connoiss ures you are going to have a treat here is an engraving of the duke of wellington surrounded by his staff on the field of waterloo and notwithstanding recent events which have as it were enveloped our great hero in a cloud i will be bold to say for a man in my line must not be blown about by political winds that a finer subject of the modern order belonging to our own time and epoch the understanding of man could hardly conceive angels might perhaps but not men sirs not men who painted it said mr powderell much impressed it is a proof before the letter mr powderell the painter is not known answered trumbull with a certain gaspingness in his last words after which he pursed up his lips and stared round him i ll bid a pound said mr powderell in a tone of resolved emotion as of a man ready to put himself in the breach whether from awe or pity nobody raised the price on him next came two dutch prints which mr toller had been eager for and after he had secured them he went away other prints and afterwards some paintings were sold to leading middlemarchers who had come with a special desire for them and there was a more active movement of the audience in and out some who had bought what they wanted going away others coming in either quite newly or from a temporary visit to the refreshments which were spread under the marquee on the lawn it was this marquee that mr bambridge was bent on buying and he appeared to like looking inside it frequently as a foretaste of its possession on the last occasion of his return from it he was observed to bring with him a new companion a stranger to mr trumbull and every one else whose appearance however led to the supposition that he might be a relative of the horse dealer s also given to indulgence his large whiskers imposing swagger and swing of the leg made him a striking figure but his suit of black rather shabby at the edges caused the prejudicial inference that he was not able to afford himself as much indulgence as he liked who is it you ve picked up bam said mr horrock aside ask him yourself returned mr bambridge he said he d just turned in from the road mr horrock eyed the stranger who was leaning back against his stick with one hand using his toothpick with the other and looking about him with a certain restlessness apparently under the silence imposed on him by circumstances at length the supper at emmaus was brought forward to will s immense relief for he was getting so tired of the proceedings that he had drawn back a little and leaned his shoulder against the wall just behind the auctioneer he now came forward again and his eye caught the conspicuous stranger who rather to his surprise was staring at him markedly but will was immediately appealed to by mr trumbull yes mr ladislaw yes this interests you as a connoiss ure i think it is some pleasure the auctioneer went on with a rising fervor to have a picture like this to show to a company of ladies and gentlemen a picture worth any sum to an individual whose means were on a level with his judgment it is a painting of the italian school by the celebrated guydo the greatest painter in the world the chief of the old masters as they are called i take it because they were up to a thing or two beyond most of us in possession of secrets now lost to the bulk of mankind let me tell you gentlemen i have seen a great many pictures by the old masters and they are not all up to this mark some of them are darker than you might like and not family subjects but here is a guydo the frame alone is worth pounds which any lady might be proud to hang up a suitable thing for what we call a refectory in a charitable institution if any gentleman of the corporation wished to show his munifi cence turn it a little sir yes joseph turn it a little towards mr ladislaw mr ladislaw having been abroad understands the merit of these things you observe all eyes were for a moment turned towards will who said coolly five pounds the auctioneer burst out in deep remonstrance ah mr ladislaw the frame alone is worth that ladies and gentlemen for the credit of the town suppose it should be discovered hereafter that a gem of art has been amongst us in this town and nobody in middlemarch awake to it five guineas five seven six five ten still ladies still it is a gem and full many a gem as the poet says has been allowed to go at a nominal price because the public knew no better because it was offered in circles where there was i was going to say a low feeling but no six pounds six guineas a guydo of the first order going at six guineas it is an insult to religion ladies it touches us all as christians gentlemen that a subject like this should go at such a low figure six pounds ten seven the bidding was brisk and will continued to share in it remembering that mrs bulstrode had a strong wish for the picture and thinking that he might stretch the price to twelve pounds but it was knocked down to him at ten guineas whereupon he pushed his way towards the bow window and went out he chose to go under the marquee to get a glass of water being hot and thirsty it was empty of other visitors and he asked the woman in attendance to fetch him some fresh water but before she was well gone he was annoyed to see entering the florid stranger who had stared at him it struck will at this moment that the man might be one of those political parasitic insects of the bloated kind who had once or twice claimed acquaintance with him as having heard him speak on the reform question and who might think of getting a shilling by news in this light his person already rather heating to behold on a summer s day appeared the more disagreeable and will half seated on the elbow of a garden chair turned his eyes carefully away from the comer but this signified little to our acquaintance mr raffles who never hesitated to thrust himself on unwilling observation if it suited his purpose to do so he moved a step or two till he was in front of will and said with full mouthed haste excuse me mr ladislaw was your mother s name sarah dunkirk will starting to his feet moved backward a step frowning and saying with some fierceness yes sir it was and what is that to you it was in will s nature that the first spark it threw out was a direct answer of the question and a challenge of the consequences to have said what is that to you in the first instance would have seemed like shuffling as if he minded who knew anything about his origin raffles on his side had not the same eagerness for a collision which was implied in ladislaw s threatening air the slim young fellow with his girl s complexion looked like a tiger cat ready to spring on him under such circumstances mr raffles s pleasure in annoying his company was kept in abeyance no offence my good sir no offence i only remember your mother knew her when she was a girl but it is your father that you feature sir i had the pleasure of seeing your father too parents alive mr ladislaw no thundered will in the same attitude as before should be glad to do you a service mr ladislaw by jove i should hope to meet again hereupon raffles who had lifted his hat with the last words turned himself round with a swing of his leg and walked away will looked after him a moment and could see that he did not re enter the auction room but appeared to be walking towards the road for an instant he thought that he had been foolish not to let the man go on talking but no on the whole he preferred doing without knowledge from that source later in the evening however raffles overtook him in the street and appearing either to have forgotten the roughness of his former reception or to intend avenging it by a forgiving familiarity greeted him jovially and walked by his side remarking at first on the pleasantness of the town and neighborhood will suspected that the man had been drinking and was considering how to shake him off when raffles said i ve been abroad myself mr ladislaw i ve seen the world used to parley vous a little it was at boulogne i saw your father a most uncommon likeness you are of him by jove mouth nose eyes hair turned off your brow just like his a little in the foreign style john bull doesn t do much of that but your father was very ill when i saw him lord lord hands you might see through you were a small youngster then did he get well no said will curtly ah well i ve often wondered what became of your mother she ran away from her friends when she was a young lass
GE(Mddlem...),it came shortly before the memorable meeting at the town hall and was nothing less than a letter from will ladislaw to lydgate which turned indeed chiefly on his new interest in plans of colonization but mentioned incidentally that he might find it necessary to pay a visit to middlemarch within the next few weeks a very pleasant necessity he said almost as good as holidays to a schoolboy he hoped there was his old place on the rug and a great deal of music in store for him but he was quite uncertain as to the time while lydgate was reading the letter to rosamond her face looked like a reviving flower it grew prettier and more blooming there was nothing unendurable now the debts were paid mr ladislaw was coming and lydgate would be persuaded to leave middlemarch and settle in london which was so different from a provincial town that was a bright bit of morning but soon the sky became black over poor rosamond the presence of a new gloom in her husband about which he was entirely reserved towards her for he dreaded to expose his lacerated feeling to her neutrality and misconception soon received a painfully strange explanation alien to all her previous notions of what could affect her happiness in the new gayety of her spirits thinking that lydgate had merely a worse fit of moodiness than usual causing him to leave her remarks unanswered and evidently to keep out of her way as much as possible she chose a few days after the meeting and without speaking to him on the subject to send out notes of invitation for a small evening party feeling convinced that this was a judicious step since people seemed to have been keeping aloof from them and wanted restoring to the old habit of intercourse when the invitations had been accepted she would tell lydgate and give him a wise admonition as to how a medical man should behave to his neighbors for rosamond had the gravest little airs possible about other people s duties but all the invitations were declined and the last answer came into lydgate s hands this is chichely s scratch what is he writing to you about said lydgate wonderingly as he handed the note to her she was obliged to let him see it and looking at her severely he said why on earth have you been sending out invitations without telling me rosamond i beg i insist that you will not invite any one to this house i suppose you have been inviting others and they have refused too she said nothing do you hear me thundered lydgate yes certainly i hear you said rosamond turning her head aside with the movement of a graceful long necked bird lydgate tossed his head without any grace and walked out of the room feeling himself dangerous rosamond s thought was that he was getting more and more unbearable not that there was any new special reason for this peremptoriness his indisposition to tell her anything in which he was sure beforehand that she would not be interested was growing into an unreflecting habit and she was in ignorance of everything connected with the thousand pounds except that the loan had come from her uncle bulstrode lydgate s odious humors and their neighbors apparent avoidance of them had an unaccountable date for her in their relief from money difficulties if the invitations had been accepted she would have gone to invite her mamma and the rest whom she had seen nothing of for several days and she now put on her bonnet to go and inquire what had become of them all suddenly feeling as if there were a conspiracy to leave her in isolation with a husband disposed to offend everybody it was after the dinner hour and she found her father and mother seated together alone in the drawing room they greeted her with sad looks saying well my dear and no more she had never seen her father look so downcast and seating herself near him she said is there anything the matter papa he did not answer but mrs vincy said oh my dear have you heard nothing it won t be long before it reaches you is it anything about tertius said rosamond turning pale the idea of trouble immediately connected itself with what had been unaccountable to her in him oh my dear yes to think of your marrying into this trouble debt was bad enough but this will be worse stay stay lucy said mr vincy have you heard nothing about your uncle bulstrode rosamond no papa said the poor thing feeling as if trouble were not anything she had before experienced but some invisible power with an iron grasp that made her soul faint within her her father told her everything saying at the end it s better for you to know my dear i think lydgate must leave the town things have gone against him i dare say he couldn t help it i don t accuse him of any harm said mr vincy he had always before been disposed to find the utmost fault with lydgate the shock to rosamond was terrible it seemed to her that no lot could be so cruelly hard as hers to have married a man who had become the centre of infamous suspicions in many cases it is inevitable that the shame is felt to be the worst part of crime and it would have required a great deal of disentangling reflection such as had never entered into rosamond s life for her in these moments to feel that her trouble was less than if her husband had been certainly known to have done something criminal all the shame seemed to be there and she had innocently married this man with the belief that he and his family were a glory to her she showed her usual reticence to her parents and only said that if lydgate had done as she wished he would have left middlemarch long ago she bears it beyond anything said her mother when she was gone ah thank god said mr vincy who was much broken down but rosamond went home with a sense of justified repugnance towards her husband what had he really done how had he really acted she did not know why had he not told her everything he did not speak to her on the subject and of course she could not speak to him it came into her mind once that she would ask her father to let her go home again but dwelling on that prospect made it seem utter dreariness to her a married woman gone back to live with her parents life seemed to have no meaning for her in such a position she could not contemplate herself in it the next two days lydgate observed a change in her and believed that she had heard the bad news would she speak to him about it or would she go on forever in the silence which seemed to imply that she believed him guilty we must remember that he was in a morbid state of mind in which almost all contact was pain certainly rosamond in this case had equal reason to complain of reserve and want of confidence on his part but in the bitterness of his soul he excused himself was he not justified in shrinking from the task of telling her since now she knew the truth she had no impulse to speak to him but a deeper lying consciousness that he was in fault made him restless and the silence between them became intolerable to him it was as if they were both adrift on one piece of wreck and looked away from each other he thought i am a fool haven t i given up expecting anything i have married care not help and that evening he said rosamond have you heard anything that distresses you yes she answered laying down her work which she had been carrying on with a languid semi consciousness most unlike her usual self what have you heard everything i suppose papa told me that people think me disgraced yes said rosamond faintly beginning to sew again automatically there was silence lydgate thought if she has any trust in me any notion of what i am she ought to speak now and say that she does not believe i have deserved disgrace but rosamond on her side went on moving her fingers languidly whatever was to be said on the subject she expected to come from tertius what did she know and if he were innocent of any wrong why did he not do something to clear himself this silence of hers brought a new rush of gall to that bitter mood in which lydgate had been saying to himself that nobody believed in him even farebrother had not come forward he had begun to question her with the intent that their conversation should disperse the chill fog which had gathered between them but he felt his resolution checked by despairing resentment even this trouble like the rest she seemed to regard as if it were hers alone he was always to her a being apart doing what she objected to he started from his chair with an angry impulse and thrusting his hands in his pockets walked up and down the room there was an underlying consciousness all the while that he should have to master this anger and tell her everything and convince her of the facts for he had almost learned the lesson that he must bend himself to her nature and that because she came short in her sympathy he must give the more soon he recurred to his intention of opening himself the occasion must not be lost if he could bring her to feel with some solemnity that here was a slander which must be met and not run away from and that the whole trouble had come out of his desperate want of money it would be a moment for urging powerfully on her that they should be one in the resolve to do with as little money as possible so that they might weather the bad time and keep themselves independent he would mention the definite measures which he desired to take and win her to a willing spirit he was bound to try this and what else was there for him to do he did not know how long he had been walking uneasily backwards and forwards but rosamond felt that it was long and wished that he would sit down she too had begun to think this an opportunity for urging on tertius what he ought to do whatever might be the truth about all this misery there was one dread which asserted itself lydgate at last seated himself not in his usual chair but in one nearer to rosamond leaning aside in it towards her and looking at her gravely before he reopened the sad subject he had conquered himself so far and was about to speak with a sense of solemnity as on an occasion which was not to be repeated he had even opened his lips when rosamond letting her hands fall looked at him and said surely tertius well surely now at last you have given up the idea of staying in middlemarch i cannot go on living here let us go to london papa and every one else says you had better go whatever misery i have to put up with it will be easier away from here lydgate felt miserably jarred instead of that critical outpouring for which he had prepared himself with effort here was the old round to be gone through again he could not bear it with a quick change of countenance he rose and went out of the room perhaps if he had been strong enough to persist in his determination to be the more because she was less that evening might have had a better issue if his energy could have borne down that check he might still have wrought on rosamond s vision and will we cannot be sure that any natures however inflexible or peculiar will resist this effect from a more massive being than their own they may be taken by storm and for the moment converted becoming part of the soul which enwraps them in the ardor of its movement but poor lydgate had a throbbing pain within him and his energy had fallen short of its task the beginning of mutual understanding and resolve seemed as far off as ever nay it seemed blocked out by the sense of unsuccessful effort they lived on from day to day with their thoughts still apart lydgate going about what work he had in a mood of despair and rosamond feeling with some justification that he was behaving cruelly it was of no use to say anything to tertius but when will ladislaw came she was determined to tell him everything in spite of her general reticence she needed some one who would recognize her wrongs some days later lydgate was riding to lowick manor in consequence of a summons from dorothea the summons had not been unexpected since it had followed a letter from mr bulstrode in which he stated that he had resumed his arrangements for quitting middlemarch and must remind lydgate of his previous communications about the hospital to the purport of which he still adhered it had been his duty before taking further steps to reopen the subject with mrs casaubon who now wished as before to discuss the question with lydgate your views may possibly have undergone some change wrote mr bulstrode but in that case also it is desirable that you should lay them before her dorothea awaited his arrival with eager interest though in deference to her masculine advisers she had refrained from what sir james had called interfering in this bulstrode business the hardship of lydgate s position was continually in her mind and when bulstrode applied to her again about the hospital she felt that the opportunity was come to her which she had been hindered from hastening in her luxurious home wandering under the boughs of her own great trees her thought was going out over the lot of others and her emotions were imprisoned the idea of some active good within her reach haunted her like a passion and another s need having once come to her as a distinct image preoccupied her desire with the yearning to give relief and made her own ease tasteless she was full of confident hope about this interview with lydgate never heeding what was said of his personal reserve never heeding that she was a very young woman nothing could have seemed more irrelevant to dorothea than insistence on her youth and sex when she was moved to show her human fellowship as she sat waiting in the library she could do nothing but live through again all the past scenes which had brought lydgate into her memories they all owed their significance to her marriage and its troubles but no there were two occasions in which the image of lydgate had come painfully in connection with his wife and some one else the pain had been allayed for dorothea but it had left in her an awakened conjecture as to what lydgate s marriage might be to him a susceptibility to the slightest hint about mrs lydgate these thoughts were like a drama to her and made her eyes bright and gave an attitude of suspense to her whole frame though she was only looking out from the brown library on to the turf and the bright green buds which stood in relief against the dark evergreens when lydgate came in she was almost shocked at the change in his face which was strikingly perceptible to her who had not seen him for two months it was not the change of emaciation but that effect which even young faces will very soon show from the persistent presence of resentment and despondency her cordial look when she put out her hand to him softened his expression but only with melancholy i have wished very much to see you for a long while mr lydgate said dorothea when they were seated opposite each other but i put off asking you to come until mr bulstrode applied to me again about the hospital i know that the advantage of keeping the management of it separate from that of the infirmary depends on you or at least on the good which you are encouraged to hope for from having it under your control and i am sure you will not refuse to tell me exactly what you think you want to decide whether you should give a generous support to the hospital said lydgate i cannot conscientiously advise you to do it in dependence on any activity of mine i may be obliged to leave the town he spoke curtly feeling the ache of despair as to his being able to carry out any purpose that rosamond had set her mind against not because there is no one to believe in you said dorothea pouring out her words in clearness from a full heart i know the unhappy mistakes about you i knew them from the first moment to be mistakes you have never done anything vile you would not do anything dishonorable it was the first assurance of belief in him that had fallen on lydgate s ears he drew a deep breath and said thank you he could say no more it was something very new and strange in his life that these few words of trust from a woman should be so much to him i beseech you to tell me how everything was said dorothea fearlessly i am sure that the truth would clear you lydgate started up from his chair and went towards the window forgetting where he was he had so often gone over in his mind the possibility of explaining everything without aggravating appearances that would tell perhaps unfairly against bulstrode and had so often decided against it he had so often said to himself that his assertions would not change people s impressions that dorothea s words sounded like a temptation to do something which in his soberness he had pronounced to be unreasonable tell me pray said dorothea with simple earnestness then we can consult together it is wicked to let people think evil of any one falsely when it can be hindered lydgate turned remembering where he was and saw dorothea s face looking up at him with a sweet trustful gravity the presence of a noble nature generous in its wishes ardent in its charity changes the lights for us we begin to see things again in their larger quieter masses and to believe that we too can be seen and judged in the wholeness of our character that influence was beginning to act on lydgate who had for many days been seeing all life as one who is dragged and struggling amid the throng he sat down again and felt that he was recovering his old self in the consciousness that he was with one who believed in it i don t want he said to bear hard on bulstrode who has lent me money of which i was in need though i would rather have gone without it now he is hunted down and miserable and has only a poor thread of life in him but i should like to tell you everything it will be a comfort to me to speak where belief has gone beforehand and where i shall not seem to be offering assertions of my own honesty you will feel what is fair to another as you feel what is fair to me do trust me said dorothea i will not repeat anything without your leave but at the very least i could say that you have made all the circumstances clear to me and that i know you are not in any way guilty mr farebrother would believe me and my uncle and sir james chettam nay there are persons in middlemarch to whom i could go although they don t know much of me they would believe me they would know that i could have no other motive than truth and justice i would take any pains to clear you i have very little to do there is nothing better that i can do in the world dorothea s voice as she made this childlike picture of what she would do might have been almost taken as a proof that she could do it effectively the searching tenderness of her woman s tones seemed made for a defence against ready accusers lydgate did not stay to think that she was quixotic he gave himself up for the first time in his life to the exquisite sense of leaning entirely on a generous sympathy without any check of proud reserve and he told her everything from the time when under the pressure of his difficulties he unwillingly made his first application to bulstrode gradually in the relief of speaking getting into a more thorough utterance of what had gone on in his mind entering fully into the fact that his treatment of the patient was opposed to the dominant practice into his doubts at the last his ideal of medical duty and his uneasy consciousness that the acceptance of the money had made some difference in his private inclination and professional behavior though not in his fulfilment of any publicly recognized obligation it has come to my knowledge since he added that hawley sent some one to examine the housekeeper at stone court and she said that she gave the patient all the opium in the phial i left as well as a good deal of brandy but that would not have been opposed to ordinary prescriptions even of first rate men the suspicions against me had no hold there they are grounded on the knowledge that i took money that bulstrode had strong motives for wishing the man to die and that he gave me the money as a bribe to concur in some malpractices or other against the patient that in any case i accepted a bribe to hold my tongue they are just the suspicions that cling the most obstinately because they lie in people s inclination and can never be disproved how my orders came to be disobeyed is a question to which i don t know the answer it is still possible that bulstrode was innocent of any criminal intention even possible that he had nothing to do with the disobedience and merely abstained from mentioning it but all that has nothing to do with the public belief it is one of those cases on which a man is condemned on the ground of his character it is believed that he has committed a crime in some undefined way because he had the motive for doing it and bulstrode s character has enveloped me because i took his money i am simply blighted like a damaged ear of corn the business is done and can t be undone oh it is hard said dorothea i understand the difficulty there is in your vindicating yourself and that all this should have come to you who had meant to lead a higher life than the common and to find out better ways i cannot bear to rest in this as unchangeable i know you meant that i remember what you said to me when you first spoke to me about the hospital there is no
