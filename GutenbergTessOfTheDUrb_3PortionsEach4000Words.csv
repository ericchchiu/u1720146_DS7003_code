TH(Tess...),she was seeing it then to decline to marry him after all in obedience to her emotion of last night and leave the dairy meant to go to some strange place not a dairy for milkmaids were not in request now calving time was coming on to go to some arable farm where no divine being like angel clare was she hated the thought and she hated more the thought of going home so that seriously dearest tess he continued since you will probably have to leave at christmas it is in every way desirable and convenient that i should carry you off then as my property besides if you were not the most uncalculating girl in the world you would know that we could not go on like this for ever i wish we could that it would always be summer and autumn and you always courting me and always thinking as much of me as you have done through the past summer time i always shall o i know you will she cried with a sudden fervour of faith in him angel i will fix the day when i will become yours for always thus at last it was arranged between them during that dark walk home amid the myriads of liquid voices on the right and left when they reached the dairy mr and mrs crick were promptly told with injunctions of secrecy for each of the lovers was desirous that the marriage should be kept as private as possible the dairyman though he had thought of dismissing her soon now made a great concern about losing her what should he do about his skimming who would make the ornamental butter pats for the anglebury and sandbourne ladies mrs crick congratulated tess on the shilly shallying having at last come to an end and said that directly she set eyes on tess she divined that she was to be the chosen one of somebody who was no common outdoor man tess had looked so superior as she walked across the barton on that afternoon of her arrival that she was of a good family she could have sworn in point of fact mrs crick did remember thinking that tess was graceful and good looking as she approached but the superiority might have been a growth of the imagination aided by subsequent knowledge tess was now carried along upon the wings of the hours without the sense of a will the word had been given the number of the day written down her naturally bright intelligence had begun to admit the fatalistic convictions common to field folk and those who associate more extensively with natural phenomena than with their fellow creatures and she accordingly drifted into that passive responsiveness to all things her lover suggested characteristic of the frame of mind but she wrote anew to her mother ostensibly to notify the wedding day really to again implore her advice it was a gentleman who had chosen her which perhaps her mother had not sufficiently considered a post nuptial explanation which might be accepted with a light heart by a rougher man might not be received with the same feeling by him but this communication brought no reply from mrs durbeyfield despite angel clare s plausible representation to himself and to tess of the practical need for their immediate marriage there was in truth an element of precipitancy in the step as became apparent at a later date he loved her dearly though perhaps rather ideally and fancifully than with the impassioned thoroughness of her feeling for him he had entertained no notion when doomed as he had thought to an unintellectual bucolic life that such charms as he beheld in this idyllic creature would be found behind the scenes unsophistication was a thing to talk of but he had not known how it really struck one until he came here yet he was very far from seeing his future track clearly and it might be a year or two before he would be able to consider himself fairly started in life the secret lay in the tinge of recklessness imparted to his career and character by the sense that he had been made to miss his true destiny through the prejudices of his family don t you think twould have been better for us to wait till you were quite settled in your midland farm she once asked timidly a midland farm was the idea just then to tell the truth my tess i don t like you to be left anywhere away from my protection and sympathy the reason was a good one so far as it went his influence over her had been so marked that she had caught his manner and habits his speech and phrases his likings and his aversions and to leave her in farmland would be to let her slip back again out of accord with him he wished to have her under his charge for another reason his parents had naturally desired to see her once at least before he carried her off to a distant settlement english or colonial and as no opinion of theirs was to be allowed to change his intention he judged that a couple of months life with him in lodgings whilst seeking for an advantageous opening would be of some social assistance to her at what she might feel to be a trying ordeal her presentation to his mother at the vicarage next he wished to see a little of the working of a flour mill having an idea that he might combine the use of one with corn growing the proprietor of a large old water mill at wellbridge once the mill of an abbey had offered him the inspection of his time honoured mode of procedure and a hand in the operations for a few days whenever he should choose to come clare paid a visit to the place some few miles distant one day at this time to inquire particulars and returned to talbothays in the evening she found him determined to spend a short time at the wellbridge flour mills and what had determined him less the opportunity of an insight into grinding and bolting than the casual fact that lodgings were to be obtained in that very farmhouse which before its mutilation had been the mansion of a branch of the durberville family this was always how clare settled practical questions by a sentiment which had nothing to do with them they decided to go immediately after the wedding and remain for a fortnight instead of journeying to towns and inns then we will start off to examine some farms on the other side of london that i have heard of he said and by march or april we will pay a visit to my father and mother questions of procedure such as these arose and passed and the day the incredible day on which she was to become his loomed large in the near future the thirty first of december new year s eve was the date his wife she said to herself could it ever be their two selves together nothing to divide them every incident shared by them why not and yet why one sunday morning izz huett returned from church and spoke privately to tess you was not called home this morning what it should ha been the first time of asking to day she answered looking quietly at tess you meant to be married new year s eve deary the other returned a quick affirmative and there must be three times of asking and now there be only two sundays left between tess felt her cheek paling izz was right of course there must be three perhaps he had forgotten if so there must be a week s postponement and that was unlucky how could she remind her lover she who had been so backward was suddenly fired with impatience and alarm lest she should lose her dear prize a natural incident relieved her anxiety izz mentioned the omission of the banns to mrs crick and mrs crick assumed a matron s privilege of speaking to angel on the point have ye forgot em mr clare the banns i mean no i have not forgot em says clare as soon as he caught tess alone he assured her don t let them tease you about the banns a licence will be quieter for us and i have decided on a licence without consulting you so if you go to church on sunday morning you will not hear your own name if you wished to i didn t wish to hear it dearest she said proudly but to know that things were in train was an immense relief to tess notwithstanding who had well nigh feared that somebody would stand up and forbid the banns on the ground of her history how events were favouring her i don t quite feel easy she said to herself all this good fortune may be scourged out of me afterwards by a lot of ill that s how heaven mostly does i wish i could have had common banns but everything went smoothly she wondered whether he would like her to be married in her present best white frock or if she ought to buy a new one the question was set at rest by his forethought disclosed by the arrival of some large packages addressed to her inside them she found a whole stock of clothing from bonnet to shoes including a perfect morning costume such as would well suit the simple wedding they planned he entered the house shortly after the arrival of the packages and heard her upstairs undoing them a minute later she came down with a flush on her face and tears in her eyes how thoughtful you ve been she murmured her cheek upon his shoulder even to the gloves and handkerchief my own love how good how kind no no tess just an order to a tradeswoman in london nothing more and to divert her from thinking too highly of him he told her to go upstairs and take her time and see if it all fitted and if not to get the village sempstress to make a few alterations she did return upstairs and put on the gown alone she stood for a moment before the glass looking at the effect of her silk attire and then there came into her head her mother s ballad of the mystic robe that never would become that wife that had once done amiss which mrs durbeyfield had used to sing to her as a child so blithely and so archly her foot on the cradle which she rocked to the tune suppose this robe should betray her by changing colour as her robe had betrayed queen guinevere since she had been at the dairy she had not once thought of the lines till now angel felt that he would like to spend a day with her before the wedding somewhere away from the dairy as a last jaunt in her company while there were yet mere lover and mistress a romantic day in circumstances that would never be repeated with that other and greater day beaming close ahead of them during the preceding week therefore he suggested making a few purchases in the nearest town and they started together clare s life at the dairy had been that of a recluse in respect the world of his own class for months he had never gone near a town and requiring no vehicle had never kept one hiring the dairyman s cob or gig if he rode or drove they went in the gig that day and then for the first time in their lives they shopped as partners in one concern it was christmas eve with its loads a holly and mistletoe and the town was very full of strangers who had come in from all parts of the country on account of the day tess paid the penalty of walking about with happiness superadded to beauty on her countenance by being much stared at as she moved amid them on his arm in the evening they returned to the inn at which they had put up and tess waited in the entry while angel went to see the horse and gig brought to the door the general sitting room was full of guests who were continually going in and out as the door opened and shut each time for the passage of these the light within the parlour fell full upon tess s face two men came out and passed by her among the rest one of them had stared her up and down in surprise and she fancied he was a trantridge man though that village lay so many miles off that trantridge folk were rarities here a comely maid that said the other true comely enough but unless i make a great mistake and he negatived the remainder of the definition forthwith clare had just returned from the stable yard and confronting the man on the threshold heard the words and saw the shrinking of tess the insult to her stung him to the quick and before he had considered anything at all he struck the man on the chin with the full force of his fist sending him staggering backwards into the passage the man recovered himself and seemed inclined to come on and clare stepping outside the door put himself in a posture of defence but his opponent began to think better of the matter he looked anew at tess as he passed her and said to clare i beg pardon sir twas a complete mistake i thought she was another woman forty miles from here clare feeling then that he had been too hasty and that he was moreover to blame for leaving her standing in an inn passage did what he usually did in such cases gave the man five shillings to plaster the blow and thus they parted bidding each other a pacific good night as soon as clare had taken the reins from the ostler and the young couple had driven off the two men went in the other direction and was it a mistake said the second one not a bit of it but i didn t want to hurt the gentleman s feelings not i in the meantime the lovers were driving onward could we put off our wedding till a little later tess asked in a dry dull voice i mean if we wished no my love calm yourself do you mean that the fellow may have time to summon me for assault he asked good humouredly no i only meant if it should have to be put off what she meant was not very clear and he directed her to dismiss such fancies from her mind which she obediently did as well as she could but she was grave very grave all the way home till she thought we shall go away a very long distance hundreds of miles from these parts and such as this can never happen again and no ghost of the past reach there they parted tenderly that night on the landing and clare ascended to his attic tess sat up getting on with some little requisites lest the few remaining days should not afford sufficient time while she sat she heard a noise in angel s room overhead a sound of thumping and struggling everybody else in the house was asleep and in her anxiety lest clare should be ill she ran up and knocked at his door and asked him what was the matter oh nothing dear he said from within i am so sorry i disturbed you but the reason is rather an amusing one i fell asleep and dreamt that i was fighting that fellow again who insulted you and the noise you heard was my pummelling away with my fists at my portmanteau which i pulled out to day for packing i am occasionally liable to these freaks in my sleep go to bed and think of it no more this was the last drachm required to turn the scale of her indecision declare the past to him by word of mouth she could not but there was another way she sat down and wrote on the four pages of a note sheet a succinct narrative of those events of three or four years ago put it into an envelope and directed it to clare then lest the flesh should again be weak she crept upstairs without any shoes and slipped the note under his door her night was a broken one as it well might be and she listened for the first faint noise overhead it came as usual he descended as usual she descended he met her at the bottom of the stairs and kissed her surely it was as warmly as ever he looked a little disturbed and worn she thought but he said not a word to her about her revelation even when they were alone could he have had it unless he began the subject she felt that she could say nothing so the day passed and it was evident that whatever he thought he meant to keep to himself yet he was frank and affectionate as before could it be that her doubts were childish that he forgave her that he loved her for what she was just as she was and smiled at her disquiet as at a foolish nightmare had he really received her note she glanced into his room and could see nothing of it it might be that he forgave her but even if he had not received it she had a sudden enthusiastic trust that he surely would forgive her every morning and night he was the same and thus new year s eve broke the wedding day the lovers did not rise at milking time having through the whole of this last week of their sojourn at the dairy been accorded something of the position of guests tess being honoured with a room of her own when they arrived downstairs at breakfast time they were surprised to see what effects had been produced in the large kitchen for their glory since they had last beheld it at some unnatural hour of the morning the dairyman had caused the yawning chimney corner to be whitened and the brick hearth reddened and a blazing yellow damask blower to be hung across the arch in place of the old grimy blue cotton one with a black sprig pattern which had formerly done duty there this renovated aspect of what was the focus indeed of the room on a full winter morning threw a smiling demeanour over the whole apartment i was determined to do summat in honour o t said the dairyman and as you wouldn t hear of my gieing a rattling good randy wi fiddles and bass viols complete as we should ha done in old times this was all i could think o as a noiseless thing tess s friends lived so far off that none could conveniently have been present at the ceremony even had any been asked but as a fact nobody was invited from marlott as for angel s family he had written and duly informed them of the time and assured them that he would be glad to see one at least of them there for the day if he would like to come his brothers had not replied at all seeming to be indignant with him while his father and mother had written a rather sad letter deploring his precipitancy in rushing into marriage but making the best of the matter by saying that though a dairywoman was the last daughter in law they could have expected their son had arrived at an age which he might be supposed to be the best judge this coolness in his relations distressed clare less than it would have done had he been without the grand card with which he meant to surprise them ere long to produce tess fresh from the dairy as a durberville and a lady he had felt to be temerarious and risky hence he had concealed her lineage till such time as familiarized with worldly ways by a few months travel and reading with him he could take her on a visit to his parents and impart the knowledge while triumphantly producing her as worthy of such an ancient line it was a pretty lover s dream if no more perhaps tess s lineage had more value for himself than for anybody in the world beside her perception that angel s bearing towards her still remained in no whit altered by her own communication rendered tess guiltily doubtful if he could have received it she rose from breakfast before he had finished and hastened upstairs it had occurred to her to look once more into the queer gaunt room which had been clare s den or rather eyrie for so long and climbing the ladder she stood at the open door of the apartment regarding and pondering she stooped to the threshold of the doorway where she had pushed in the note two or three days earlier in such excitement the carpet reached close to the sill and under the edge of the carpet she discerned the faint white margin of the envelope containing her letter to him which he obviously had never seen owing to her having in her haste thrust it beneath the carpet as well as beneath the door with a feeling of faintness she withdrew the letter there it was sealed up just as it had left her hands the mountain had not yet been removed she could not let him read it now the house being in full bustle of preparation and descending to her own room she destroyed the letter there she was so pale when he saw her again that he felt quite anxious the incident of the misplaced letter she had jumped at as if it prevented a confession but she knew in her conscience that it need not there was still time yet everything was in a stir there was coming and going all had to dress the dairyman and mrs crick having been asked to accompany them as witnesses and reflection or deliberate talk was well nigh impossible the only minute tess could get to be alone with clare was when they met upon the landing i am so anxious to talk to you i want to confess all my faults and blunders she said with attempted lightness no no we can t have faults talked of you must be deemed perfect to day at least my sweet he cried we shall have plenty of time hereafter i hope to talk over our failings i will confess mine at the same time but it would be better for me to do it now i think so that you could not say well my quixotic one you shall tell me anything say as soon as we are settled in our lodging not now i too will tell you my faults then but do not let us spoil the day with them they will be excellent matter for a dull time then you don t wish me to dearest i do not tessy really the hurry of dressing and starting left no time for more than this those words of his seemed to reassure her on further reflection she was whirled onward through the next couple of critical hours by the mastering tide of her devotion to him which closed up further meditation her one desire so long resisted to make herself his
TH(Tess...),by experience says roger ascham we find out a short way by a long wandering not seldom that long wandering unfits us for further travel and of what use is our experience to us then tess durbeyfield s experience was of this incapacitating kind at last she had learned what to do but who would now accept her doing if before going to the durbervilles she had vigorously moved under the guidance of sundry gnomic texts and phrases known to her and to the world in general no doubt she would never have been imposed on but it had not been in tess s power nor is it in anybody s power to feel the whole truth of golden opinions while it is possible to profit by them she and how many more might have ironically said to god with saint augustine thou hast counselled a better course than thou hast permitted she remained at her father s house during the winter months plucking fowls or cramming turkeys and geese or making clothes for her sisters and brothers out of some finery which durberville had given her and she had put by with contempt apply to him she would not but she would often clasp her hands behind her head and muse when she was supposed to be working hard she philosophically noted dates as they came past in the revolution of the year the disastrous night of her undoing at trantridge with its dark background of the chase also the dates of the baby s birth and death also her own birthday and every other day individualized by incidents in which she had taken some share she suddenly thought one afternoon when looking in the glass at her fairness that there was yet another date of greater importance to her than those that of her own death when all these charms would have disappeared a day which lay sly and unseen among all the other days of the year giving no sign or sound when she annually passed over it but not the less surely there when was it why did she not feel the chill of each yearly encounter with such a cold relation she had jeremy taylor s thought that some time in the future those who had known her would say it is the th the day that poor tess durbeyfield died and there would be nothing singular to their minds in the statement of that day doomed to be her terminus in time through all the ages she did not know the place in month week season or year almost at a leap tess thus changed from simple girl to complex woman symbols of reflectiveness passed into her face and a note of tragedy at times into her voice her eyes grew larger and more eloquent she became what would have been called a fine creature her aspect was fair and arresting her soul that of a woman whom the turbulent experiences of the last year or two had quite failed to demoralize but for the world s opinion those experiences would have been simply a liberal education she had held so aloof of late that her trouble never generally known was nearly forgotten in marlott but it became evident to her that she could never be really comfortable again in a place which had seen the collapse of her family s attempt to claim kin and through her even closer union with the rich durbervilles at least she could not be comfortable there till long years should have obliterated her keen consciousness of it yet even now tess felt the pulse of hopeful life still warm within her she might be happy in some nook which had no memories to escape the past and all that appertained thereto was to annihilate it and to do that she would have to get away was once lost always lost really true of chastity she would ask herself she might prove it false if she could veil bygones the recuperative power which pervaded organic nature was surely not denied to maidenhood alone she waited a long time without finding opportunity for a new departure a particularly fine spring came round and the stir of germination was almost audible in the buds it moved her as it moved the wild animals and made her passionate to go at last one day in early may a letter reached her from a former friend of her mother s to whom she had addressed inquiries long before a person whom she had never seen that a skilful milkmaid was required at a dairy house many miles to the southward and that the dairyman would be glad to have her for the summer months it was not quite so far off as could have been wished but it was probably far enough her radius of movement and repute having been so small to persons of limited spheres miles are as geographical degrees parishes as counties counties as provinces and kingdoms on one point she was resolved there should be no more durberville air castles in the dreams and deeds of her new life she would be the dairymaid tess and nothing more her mother knew tess s feeling on this point so well though no words had passed between them on the subject that she never alluded to the knightly ancestry now yet such is human inconsistency that one of the interests of the new place to her was the accidental virtues of its lying near her forefathers country for they were not blakemore men though her mother was blakemore to the bone the dairy called talbothays for which she was bound stood not remotely from some of the former estates of the durbervilles near the great family vaults of her granddames and their powerful husbands she would be able to look at them and think not only that durberville like babylon had fallen but that the individual innocence of a humble descendant could lapse as silently all the while she wondered if any strange good thing might come of her being in her ancestral land and some spirit within her rose automatically as the sap in the twigs it was unexpected youth surging up anew after its temporary check and bringing with it hope and the invincible instinct towards self delight on a thyme scented bird hatching morning in may between two and three years after the return from trantridge silent reconstructive years for tess durbeyfield she left her home for the second time having packed up her luggage so that it could be sent to her later she started in a hired trap for the little town of stourcastle through which it was necessary to pass on her journey now in a direction almost opposite to that of her first adventuring on the curve of the nearest hill she looked back regretfully at marlott and her father s house although she had been so anxious to get away her kindred dwelling there would probably continue their daily lives as heretofore with no great diminution of pleasure in their consciousness although she would be far off and they deprived of her smile in a few days the children would engage in their games as merrily as ever without the sense of any gap left by her departure this leaving of the younger children she had decided to be for the best were she to remain they would probably gain less good by her precepts than harm by her example she went through stourcastle without pausing and onward to a junction of highways where she could await a carrier s van that ran to the south west for the railways which engirdled this interior tract of country had never yet struck across it while waiting however there came along a farmer in his spring cart driving approximately in the direction that she wished to pursue though he was a stranger to her she accepted his offer of a seat beside him ignoring that its motive was a mere tribute to her countenance he was going to weatherbury and by accompanying him thither she could walk the remainder of the distance instead of travelling in the van by way of casterbridge tess did not stop at weatherbury after this long drive further than to make a slight nondescript meal at noon at a cottage to which the farmer recommended her thence she started on foot basket in hand to reach the wide upland of heath dividing this district from the low lying meads of a further valley in which the dairy stood that was the aim and end of her day s pilgrimage tess had never before visited this part of the country and yet she felt akin to the landscape not so very far to the left of her she could discern a dark patch in the scenery which inquiry confirmed her in supposing to be trees marking the environs of kingsbere in the church of which parish the bones of her ancestors her useless ancestors lay entombed she had no admiration for them now she almost hated them for the dance they had led her not a thing of all that had been theirs did she retain but the old seal and spoon pooh i have as much of mother as father in me she said all my prettiness comes from her and she was only a dairymaid the journey over the intervening uplands and lowlands of egdon when she reached them was a more troublesome walk than she had anticipated the distance being actually but a few miles it was two hours owing to sundry wrong turnings ere she found herself on a summit commanding the long sought for vale the valley of the great dairies the valley in which milk and butter grew to rankness and were produced more profusely if less delicately than at her home the verdant plain so well watered by the river var or froom it was intrinsically different from the vale of little dairies blackmoor vale which save during her disastrous sojourn at trantridge she had exclusively known till now the world was drawn to a larger pattern here the enclosures numbered fifty acres instead of ten the farmsteads were more extended the groups of cattle formed tribes hereabout there only families these myriads of cows stretching under her eyes from the far east to the far west outnumbered any she had ever seen at one glance before the green lea was speckled as thickly with them as a canvas by van alsloot or sallaert with burghers the ripe hue of the red and dun kine absorbed the evening sunlight which the white coated animals returned to the eye in rays almost dazzling even at the distant elevation on which she stood the bird s eye perspective before her was not so luxuriantly beautiful perhaps as that other one which she knew so well yet it was more cheering it lacked the intensely blue atmosphere of the rival vale and its heavy soils and scents the new air was clear bracing ethereal the river itself which nourished the grass and cows of these renowned dairies flowed not like the streams in blackmoor those were slow silent often turbid flowing over beds of mud into which the incautious wader might sink and vanish unawares the froom waters were clear as the pure river of life shown to the evangelist rapid as the shadow of a cloud with pebbly shallows that prattled to the sky all day long there the water flower was the lily the crow foot here either the change in the quality of the air from heavy to light or the sense of being amid new scenes where there were no invidious eyes upon her sent up her spirits wonderfully her hopes mingled with the sunshine in an ideal photosphere which surrounded her as she bounded along against the soft south wind she heard a pleasant voice in every breeze and in every bird s note seemed to lurk a joy her face had latterly changed with changing states of mind continually fluctuating between beauty and ordinariness according as the thoughts were gay or grave one day she was pink and flawless another pale and tragical when she was pink she was feeling less than when pale her more perfect beauty accorded with her less elevated mood her more intense mood with her less perfect beauty it was her best face physically that was now set against the south wind the irresistible universal automatic tendency to find sweet pleasure somewhere which pervades all life from the meanest to the highest had at length mastered tess being even now only a young woman of twenty one who mentally and sentimentally had not finished growing it was impossible that any event should have left upon her an impression that was not in time capable of transmutation and thus her spirits and her thankfulness and her hopes rose higher and higher she tried several ballads but found them inadequate till recollecting the psalter that her eyes had so often wandered over of a sunday morning before she had eaten of the tree of knowledge she chanted o ye sun and moon o ye stars ye green things upon the earth ye fowls of the air beasts and cattle children of men bless ye the lord praise him and magnify him forever she suddenly stopped and murmured but perhaps i don t quite know the lord as yet and probably the half unconscious rhapsody was a fetishistic utterance in a monotheistic setting women whose chief companions are the forms and forces of outdoor nature retain in their souls far more of the pagan fantasy of their remote forefathers than of the systematized religion taught their race at later date however tess found at least approximate expression for her feelings in the old benedicite that she had lisped from infancy and it was enough such high contentment with such a slight initial performance as that of having started towards a means of independent living was a part of the durbeyfield temperament tess really wished to walk uprightly while her father did nothing of the kind but she resembled him in being content with immediate and small achievements and in having no mind for laborious effort towards such petty social advancement as could alone be effected by a family so heavily handicapped as the once powerful durbervilles were now there was it might be said the energy of her mother s unexpended family as well as the natural energy of tess s years rekindled after the experience which had so overwhelmed her for the time let the truth be told women do as a rule live through such humiliations and regain their spirits and again look about them with an interested eye while there s life there s hope is a conviction not so entirely unknown to the betrayed as some amiable theorists would have us believe tess durbeyfield then in good heart and full of zest for life descended the egdon slopes lower and lower towards the dairy of her pilgrimage the marked difference in the final particular between the rival vales now showed itself the secret of blackmoor was best discovered from the heights around to read aright the valley before her it was necessary to descend into its midst when tess had accomplished this feat she found herself to be standing on a carpeted level which stretched to the east and west as far as the eye could reach the river had stolen from the higher tracts and brought in particles to the vale all this horizontal land and now exhausted aged and attenuated lay serpentining along through the midst of its former spoils not quite sure of her direction tess stood still upon the hemmed expanse of verdant flatness like a fly on a billiard table of indefinite length and of no more consequence to the surroundings than that fly the sole effect of her presence upon the placid valley so far had been to excite the mind of a solitary heron which after descending to the ground not far from her path stood with neck erect looking at her suddenly there arose from all parts of the lowland a prolonged and repeated call waow waow waow from the furthest east to the furthest west the cries spread as if by contagion accompanied in some cases by the barking of a dog it was not the expression of the valley s consciousness that beautiful tess had arrived but the ordinary announcement of milking time half past four o clock when the dairymen set about getting in the cows the red and white herd nearest at hand which had been phlegmatically waiting for the call now trooped towards the steading in the background their great bags of milk swinging under them as they walked tess followed slowly in their rear and entered the barton by the open gate through which they had entered before her long thatched sheds stretched round the enclosure their slopes encrusted with vivid green moss and their eaves supported by wooden posts rubbed to a glossy smoothness by the flanks of infinite cows and calves of bygone years now passed to an oblivion almost inconceivable in its profundity between the post were ranged the milchers each exhibiting herself at the present moment to a whimsical eye in the rear as a circle on two stalks down the centre of which a switch moved pendulum wise while the sun lowering itself behind this patient row threw their shadows accurately inwards upon the wall thus it threw shadows of these obscure and homely figures every evening with as much care over each contour as if it had been the profile of a court beauty on a palace wall copied them as diligently as it had copied olympian shapes on marble façades long ago or the outline of alexander caesar and the pharaohs they were the less restful cows that were stalled those that would stand still of their own will were milked in the middle of the yard where many of such better behaved ones stood waiting now all prime milchers such as were seldom seen out of this valley and not always within it nourished by the succulent feed which the water meads supplied at this prime season of the year those of them that were spotted with white reflected the sunshine in dazzling brilliancy and the polished brass knobs of their horns glittered with something of military display their large veined udders hung ponderous as sandbags the teats sticking out like the legs of a gipsy s crock and as each animal lingered for her turn to arrive the milk oozed forth and fell in drops to the ground the dairymaids and men had flocked down from their cottages and out of the dairy house with the arrival of the cows from the meads the maids walking in pattens not on account of the weather but to keep their shoes above the mulch of the barton each girl sat down on her three legged stool her face sideways her right cheek resting against the cow and looked musingly along the animal s flank at tess as she approached the male milkers with hat brims turned down resting flat on their foreheads and gazing on the ground did not observe her one of these was a sturdy middle aged man whose long white pinner was somewhat finer and cleaner than the wraps of the others and whose jacket underneath had a presentable marketing aspect the master dairyman of whom she was in quest his double character as a working milker and butter maker here during six days and on the seventh as a man in shining broad cloth in his family pew at church being so marked as to have inspired a rhyme dairyman dick all the week on sundays mister richard crick seeing tess standing at gaze he went across to her the majority of dairymen have a cross manner at milking time but it happened that mr crick was glad to get a new hand for the days were busy ones now and he received her warmly inquiring for her mother and the rest of the family though this as a matter of form merely for in reality he had not been aware of mrs durbeyfield s existence till apprised of the fact by a brief business letter about tess oh ay as a lad i knowed your part o the country very well he said terminatively though i ve never been there since and a aged woman of ninety that use to live nigh here but is dead and gone long ago told me that a family of some such name as yours in blackmoor vale came originally from these parts and that twere a old ancient race that had all but perished off the earth though the new generations didn t know it but lord i took no notice of the old woman s ramblings not i oh no it is nothing said tess then the talk was of business only you can milk em clean my maidy i don t want my cows going azew at this time o year she reassured him on that point and he surveyed her up and down she had been staying indoors a good deal and her complexion had grown delicate quite sure you can stand it tis comfortable enough here for rough folk but we don t live in a cowcumber frame she declared that she could stand it and her zest and willingness seemed to win him over well i suppose you ll want a dish o tay or victuals of some sort hey not yet well do as ye like about it but faith if twas i i should be as dry as a kex wi travelling so far i ll begin milking now to get my hand in said tess she drank a little milk as temporary refreshment to the surprise indeed slight contempt of dairyman crick to whose mind it had apparently never occurred that milk was good as a beverage oh if ye can swaller that be it so he said indifferently while holding up the pail that she sipped from tis what i hain t touched for years not i rot the stuff it would lie in my innerds like lead you can try your hand upon she he pursued nodding to the nearest cow not but what she do milk rather hard we ve hard ones and we ve easy ones like other folks however you ll find out that soon enough when tess had changed her bonnet for a hood and was really on her stool under the cow and the milk was squirting from her fists into the pail she appeared to feel that she really had laid a new foundation for her future the conviction bred serenity her pulse slowed and she was able to look about her the milkers formed quite a little battalion of men and maids the men operating on the hard teated animals the maids on the kindlier natures it was a large dairy there were nearly a hundred milchers under crick s management all told and of the herd the master dairyman milked six or eight with his own hands unless away from home these were the cows that milked hardest of all for his journey milkmen being more or less casually hired he would not entrust this half dozen to their treatment lest from indifference they should not milk them fully nor to the maids lest they should fail in the same way for lack of finger grip with the result that in course of time the cows would go azew that is dry up it was not the loss for the moment that made
TH(Tess...),The lineaments as such seemed to complain They had been diverted from their hereditary connotation to signify impressions for which Nature did not intend them Strange that their very elevation was a misapplication that to raise seemed to falsify Yet could it be so She would admit the ungenerous sentiment no longer dUrberville was not the first wicked man who had turned away from his wickedness to save his soul alive and why should she deem it unnatural in him It was but the usage of thought which had been jarred in her at hearing good new words in bad old notes The greater the sinner the greater the saint it was not necessary to dive far into Christian history to discover that Such impressions as these moved her vaguely and without strict definiteness As soon as the nerveless pause of her surprise would allow her to stir her impulse was to pass on out of his sight He had obviously not discerned her yet in her position against the sun But the moment that she moved again he recognized her The effect upon her old lover was electric far stronger than the effect of his presence upon her His fire the tumultuous ring of his eloquence seemed to go out of him His lip struggled and trembled under the words that lay upon it but deliver them it could not as long as she faced him His eyes after their first glance upon her face hung confusedly in every other direction but hers but came back in a desperate leap every few seconds This paralysis lasted however but a short time for Tess s energies returned with the atrophy of his and she walked as fast as she was able past the barn and onward As soon as she could reflect it appalled her this change in their relative platforms He who had wrought her undoing was now on the side of the Spirit while she remained unregenerate And as in the legend it had resulted that her Cyprian image had suddenly appeared upon his altar whereby the fire of the priest had been well nigh extinguished She went on without turning her head Her back seemed to be endowed with a sensitiveness to ocular beams even her clothing so alive was she to a fancied gaze which might be resting upon her from the outside of that barn All the way along to this point her heart had been heavy with an inactive sorrow now there was a change in the quality of its trouble That hunger for affection too long withheld was for the time displaced by an almost physical sense of an implacable past which still engirdled her It intensified her consciousness of error to a practical despair the break of continuity between her earlier and present existence which she had hoped for had not after all taken place Bygones would never be complete bygones till she was a bygone herself Thus absorbed she recrossed the northern part of Long Ash Lane at right angles and presently saw before her the road ascending whitely to the upland along whose margin the remainder of her journey lay Its dry pale surface stretched severely onward unbroken by a single figure vehicle or mark save some occasional brown horse droppings which dotted its cold aridity here and there While slowly breasting this ascent Tess became conscious of footsteps behind her and turning she saw approaching that well known form so strangely accoutred as the Methodist the one personage in all the world she wished not to encounter alone on this side of the grave There was not much time however for thought or elusion and she yielded as calmly as she could to the necessity of letting him overtake her She saw that he was excited less by the speed of his walk than by the feelings within him Tess he said She slackened speed without looking round Tess he repeated It is I Alec dUrberville She then looked back at him and he came up I see it is she answered coldly Well is that all Yet I deserve no more Of course he added with a slight laugh there is something of the ridiculous to your eyes in seeing me like this But I must put up with that I heard you had gone away nobody knew where Tess you wonder why I have followed you I do rather and I would that you had not with all my heart Yes you may well say it he returned grimly as they moved onward together she with unwilling tread But don t mistake me I beg this because you may have been led to do so in noticing if you did notice it how your sudden appearance unnerved me down there It was but a momentary faltering and considering what you have been to me it was natural enough But will helped me through it though perhaps you think me a humbug for saying it and immediately afterwards I felt that of all persons in the world whom it was my duty and desire to save from the wrath to come sneer if you like the woman whom I had so grievously wronged was that person I have come with that sole purpose in view nothing more There was the smallest vein of scorn in her words of rejoinder Have you saved yourself Charity begins at home they say I have done nothing said he indifferently Heaven as I have been telling my hearers has done all No amount of contempt that you can pour upon me Tess will equal what I have poured upon myself the old Adam of my former years Well it is a strange story believe it or not but I can tell you the means by which my conversion was brought about and I hope you will be interested enough at least to listen Have you ever heard the name of the parson of Emminster you must have done do old Mr Clare one of the most earnest of his school one of the few intense men left in the Church not so intense as the extreme wing of Christian believers with which I have thrown in my lot but quite an exception among the Established clergy the younger of whom are gradually attenuating the true doctrines by their sophistries till they are but the shadow of what they were I only differ from him on the question of Church and State the interpretation of the text Come out from among them and be ye separate saith the Lord that s all He is one who I firmly believe has been the humble means of saving more souls in this country than any other man you can name You have heard of him I have she said He came to Trantridge two or three years ago to preach on behalf of some missionary society and I wretched fellow that I was insulted him when in his disinterestedness he tried to reason with me and show me the way He did not resent my conduct he simply said that some day I should receive the first fruits of the Spirit that those who came to scoff sometimes remained to pray There was a strange magic in his words They sank into my mind But the loss of my mother hit me most and by degrees I was brought to see daylight Since then my one desire has been to hand on the true view to others and that is what I was trying to do to day though it is only lately that I have preached hereabout The first months of my ministry have been spent in the North of England among strangers where I preferred to make my earliest clumsy attempts so as to acquire courage before undergoing that severest of all tests of one s sincerity addressing those who have known one and have been one s companions in the days of darkness If you could only know Tess the pleasure of having a good slap at yourself I am sure Don t go on with it she cried passionately as she turned away from him to a stile by the wayside on which she bent herself I can t believe in such sudden things I feel indignant with you for talking to me like this when you know when you know what harm you ve done me You and those like you take your fill of pleasure on earth by making the life of such as me bitter and black with sorrow and then it is a fine thing when you have had enough of that to think of securing your pleasure in heaven by becoming converted Out upon such I don t believe in you I hate it Tess he insisted don t speak so It came to me like a jolly new idea And you don t believe me What don t you believe Your conversion Your scheme of religion Why She dropped her voice Because a better man than you does not believe in such What a woman s reason Who is this better man I cannot tell you Well he declared a resentment beneath his words seeming ready to spring out at a moment s notice God forbid that I should say I am a good man and you know I don t say any such thing I am new to goodness truly but newcomers see furthest sometimes Yes she replied sadly But I cannot believe in your conversion to a new spirit Such flashes as you feel Alec I fear don t last Thus speaking she turned from the stile over which she had been leaning and faced him whereupon his eyes falling casually upon the familiar countenance and form remained contemplating her The inferior man was quiet in him now but it was surely not extracted nor even entirely subdued Don t look at me like that he said abruptly Tess who had been quite unconscious of her action and mien instantly withdrew the large dark gaze of her eyes stammering with a flush I beg your pardon And there was revived in her the wretched sentiment which had often come to her before that in inhabiting the fleshly tabernacle with which Nature had endowed her she was somehow doing wrong No no Don t beg my pardon But since you wear a veil to hide your good looks why don t you keep it down She pulled down the veil saying hastily It was mostly to keep off the wind It may seem harsh of me to dictate like this he went on but it is better that I should not look too often on you It might be dangerous Ssh said Tess Well women s faces have had too much power over me already for me not to fear them An evangelist has nothing to do with such as they and it reminds me of the old times that I would forget After this their conversation dwindled to a casual remark now and then as they rambled onward Tess inwardly wondering how far he was going with her and not liking to send him back by positive mandate Frequently when they came to a gate or stile they found painted thereon in red or blue letters some text of Scripture and she asked him if he knew who had been at the pains to blazon these announcements He told her that the man was employed by himself and others who were working with him in that district to paint these reminders that no means might be left untried which might move the hearts of a wicked generation At length the road touched the spot called Cross in Hand Of all spots on the bleached and desolate upland this was the most forlorn It was so far removed from the charm which is sought in landscape by artists and view lovers as to reach a new kind of beauty a negative beauty of tragic tone The place took its name from a stone pillar which stood there a strange rude monolith from a stratum unknown in any local quarry on which was roughly carved a human hand Differing accounts were given of its history and purport Some authorities stated that a devotional cross had once formed the complete erection thereon of which the present relic was but the stump others that the stone as it stood was entire and that it had been fixed there to mark a boundary or place of meeting Anyhow whatever the origin of the relic there was and is something sinister or solemn according to mood in the scene amid which it stands something tending to impress the most phlegmatic passer by I think I must leave you now he remarked as they drew near to this spot I have to preach at Abbot s Cernel at six this evening and my way lies across to the right from here And you upset me somewhat too Tessy I cannot will not say why I must go away and get strength How is it that you speak so fluently now Who has taught you such good English I have learnt things in my troubles she said evasively What troubles have you had She told him of the first one the only one that related to him dUrberville was struck mute I knew nothing of this till now he next murmured Why didn t you write to me when you felt your trouble coming on She did not reply and he broke the silence by adding Well you will see me again No she answered Do not again come near me I will think But before we part come here He stepped up to the pillar This was once a Holy Cross Relics are not in my creed but I fear you at moments far more than you need fear me at present and to lessen my fear put your hand upon that stone hand and swear that you will never tempt me by your charms or ways Good God how can you ask what is so unnecessary All that is furthest from my thought Yes but swear it Tess half frightened gave way to his importunity placed her hand upon the stone and swore I am sorry you are not a believer he continued that some unbeliever should have got hold of you and unsettled your mind But no more now At home at least I can pray for you and I will and who knows what may not happen I m off Goodbye He turned to a hunting gate in the hedge and without letting his eyes again rest upon her leapt over and struck out across the down in the direction of Abbot s Cernel As he walked his pace showed perturbation and by and by as if instigated by a former thought he drew from his pocket a small book between the leaves of which was folded a letter worn and soiled as from much re reading dUrberville opened the letter It was dated several months before this time and was signed by Parson Clare The letter began by expressing the writer s unfeigned joy at dUrberville s conversion and thanked him for his kindness in communicating with the parson on the subject It expressed Mr Clare s warm assurance of forgiveness for dUrberville s former conduct and his interest in the young man s plans for the future He Mr Clare would much have liked to see dUrberville in the Church to whose ministry he had devoted so many years of his own life and would have helped him to enter a theological college to that end but since his correspondent had possibly not cared to do this on account of the delay it would have entailed he was not the man to insist upon its paramount importance Every man must work as he could best work and in the method towards which he felt impelled by the Spirit dUrberville read and re read this letter and seemed to quiz himself cynically He also read some passages from memoranda as he walked till his face assumed a calm and apparently the image of Tess no longer troubled his mind She meanwhile had kept along the edge of the hill by which lay her nearest way home Within the distance of a mile she met a solitary shepherd What is the meaning of that old stone I have passed she asked of him Was it ever a Holy Cross Cross no twer not a cross Tis a thing of ill omen Miss It was put up in wuld times by the relations of a malefactor who was tortured there by nailing his hand to a post and afterwards hung The bones lie underneath They say he sold his soul to the devil and that he walks at times She felt the petite mort at this unexpectedly gruesome information and left the solitary man behind her It was dusk when she drew near to Flintcomb Ash and in the lane at the entrance to the hamlet she approached a girl and her lover without their observing her They were talking no secrets and the clear unconcerned voice of the young woman in response to the warmer accents of the man spread into the chilly air as the one soothing thing within the dusky horizon full of a stagnant obscurity upon which nothing else intruded For a moment the voices cheered the heart of Tess till she reasoned that this interview had its origin on one side or the other in the same attraction which had been the prelude to her own tribulation When she came close the girl turned serenely and recognized her the young man walking off in embarrassment The woman was Izz Huett whose interest in Tess s excursion immediately superseded her own proceedings Tess did not explain very clearly its results and Izz who was a girl of tact began to speak of her own little affair a phase of which Tess had just witnessed He is Amby Seedling the chap who used to sometimes come and help at Talbothays she explained indifferently He actually inquired and found out that I had come here and has followed me He says he s been in love wi me these two years But I ve hardly answered him Several days had passed since her futile journey and Tess was afield The dry winter wind still blew but a screen of thatched hurdles erected in the eye of the blast kept its force away from her On the sheltered side was a turnip slicing machine whose bright blue hue of new paint seemed almost vocal in the otherwise subdued scene Opposite its front was a long mound or grave in which the roots had been preserved since early winter Tess was standing at the uncovered end chopping off with a bill hook the fibres and earth from each root and throwing it after the operation into the slicer A man was turning the handle of the machine and from its trough came the newly cut swedes the fresh smell of whose yellow chips was accompanied by the sounds of the snuffling wind the smart swish of the slicing blades and the choppings of the hook in Tess s leather gloved hand The wide acreage of blank agricultural brownness apparent where the swedes had been pulled was beginning to be striped in wales of darker brown gradually broadening to ribands Along the edge of each of these something crept upon ten legs moving without haste and without rest up and down the whole length of the field it was two horses and a man the plough going between them turning up the cleared ground for a spring sowing For hours nothing relieved the joyless monotony of things Then far beyond the ploughing teams a black speck was seen It had come from the corner of a fence where there was a gap and its tendency was up the incline towards the swede cutters From the proportions of a mere point it advanced to the shape of a ninepin and was soon perceived to be a man in black arriving from the direction of Flintcomb Ash The man at the slicer having nothing else to do with his eyes continually observed the comer but Tess who was occupied did not perceive him till her companion directed her attention to his approach It was not her hard taskmaster Farmer Groby it was one in a semi clerical costume who now represented what had once been the free and easy Alec dUrberville Not being hot at his preaching there was less enthusiasm about him now and the presence of the grinder seemed to embarrass him A pale distress was already on Tess s face and she pulled her curtained hood further over it dUrberville came up and said quietly I want to speak to you Tess You have refused my last request not to come near me said she Yes but I have a good reason Well tell it It is more serious than you may think He glanced round to see if he were overheard They were at some distance from the man who turned the slicer and the movement of the machine too sufficiently prevented Alec s words reaching other ears dUrberville placed himself so as to screen Tess from the labourer turning his back to the latter It is this he continued with capricious compunction In thinking of your soul and mine when we last met I neglected to inquire as to your worldly condition You were well dressed and I did not think of it But I see now that it is hard harder than it used to be when I knew you harder than you deserve Perhaps a good deal of it is owning to me She did not answer and he watched her inquiringly as with bent head her face completely screened by the hood she resumed her trimming of the swedes By going on with her work she felt better able to keep him outside her emotions Tess he added with a sigh of discontent yours was the very worst case I ever was concerned in I had no idea of what had resulted till you told me Scamp that I was to foul that innocent life The whole blame was mine the whole unconventional business of our time at Trantridge You too the real blood of which I am but the base imitation what a blind young thing you were as to possibilities I say in all earnestness that it is a shame for parents to bring up their girls in such dangerous ignorance of the gins and nets that the wicked may set for them whether their motive be a good one or the result of simple indifference Tess still did no more than listen throwing down one globular root and taking up another with automatic regularity the pensive contour of the mere fieldwoman alone marking her But it is not that I came to say dUrberville went on My circumstances are these I have lost my mother since you were at Trantridge and the place is my own But I intend to sell it and devote myself to missionary work in Africa A devil of a poor hand I shall make at the trade no doubt However what I want to ask you is will you put it in my power to do my duty to make the only reparation I can make for the trick played you that is will you be my wife and go with me I have already obtained this precious document It was my old mother s dying wish He drew a piece of parchment from his
