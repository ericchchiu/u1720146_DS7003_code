1,idea of his being gone to only to get a large party for the ball and a report followed that mr was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly the girls grieved over such a number of ladies but were comforted the day before the ball by that instead of twelve he had brought only six with him from london his five sisters and a cousin and when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five all together mr his two sisters the husband of the eldest and another young man mr was good looking and he had a pleasant countenance and easy unaffected manners his sisters were fine women with an air of decided fashion his brother in law mr merely looked the gentleman but his friend mr soon drew the attention of the room by his fine tall person handsome features noble mien and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance of his having ten thousand a year the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man the ladies declared he was much than mr and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity for he was discovered to be proud to be above his company and above being pleased and not all his large estate in could then save him from having a most forbidding disagreeable countenance and being unworthy to be compared with his friend mr had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room he was lively and b pride and danced every dance was angry that the ball closed and talked of giving one himself at such amiable qualities must speak for themselves what a contrast between him and his mend mr danced only once with mrs and once with miss declined being introduced to any other lady and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room speaking occasionally to one of his own party his character was decided he was the most disagreeable man in the worlds and every body hoped that he would never come there again amongst the most violent against him was mrs whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having one of her daughters elizabeth had been obliged by the of gentlemen to sit down for two dances and during part of that time mr had been standing near enough for her to a conversation between him and mr who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it come said he i must have you dance i hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner you had much better dance i certainly shall not you know how i it un less i am particularly acquainted with my partner at such an assembly as this it would be your sisters are engaged and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with i would not be so fastidious as you are cried for a kingdom upon my honour i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as i have this evening and there are several of them you see pretty you are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room said mr looking at the eldest miss oh she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld i but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you who is very pretty and i dare say very agreeable do let me ask my partner to introduce you which do mean and v a for a moment at â her eye hie th drew his own and coldly said she is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt me and i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are by other men you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles for you are wasting your time with me mr followed his advice mr walked off and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him she told the story however with great spirit among her friends for she had a lively playful disposition which delighted in any thing ridiculous the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family mrs had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the party mr had danced with her twice and she had been distinguished by his sisters jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be though in a way felt jane s pleasure mary had heard herself mentioned to miss as the most accomplished girl in tlie and and had been fortunate enough to be never without partners which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball they returned therefore in good spirits to the village where they lived and of which they were the principal inhabitants they found mr still up with a book he was regardless of time and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations he had rather hoped that all his wife s views on the stranger would be disappointed but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear oh my dear mr as she entered the room we have had a most delightful evening a most excellent ball i wish you had been there jane was so admired nothing could be like it every body said how well she looked and mr thought her quite beautiful and danced with her twice only think of that my dear he actually danced with her twice and she was the only creature in the room that he 
1,asked a second time first tâ y o tc t and of all he asked miss i was so vexed to see him stand up with her hut however he did not admire her at all indeed can jou know and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance so he who she was and got introduced and asked her for the two next then the two third he danced with miss king and the two fourth with maria and the two fifth with jane again and the two sixth with and the if he had had any compassion for me cried her impatiently he would not have danced half so much for god s sake say no more of his partners oh that he had his ankle in the first dance v oh my dear continued mrs i am quite delighted with him he is so excessively handsome and his sisters are charming women i never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses i dare say the lace upon mrs s gown here she was interrupted again mr protested against any description of finery she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject and related with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration the shocking of mr but i can assure you she added that does not lose much by not his fancy for he is a most disagreeable horrid man not at all worth pleasing so high and so conceited that there was no enduring him he walked here and he walked there himself so very great not handsome enough to dance with i wish you had been there my dear to have given him one of your set downs i quite the man chapter iv when jane and elizabeth were alone the former who had been cautious in her praise of mr before expressed to her sister how very much she admired him and prejudice he is just what a young man ought to he said she sensible good humoured lively and i never saw such happy manners so much ease with such perfect good breeding he is also handsome replied elizabeth which a young man ought likewise to be if he possibly can his character is thereby complete i was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time i did not expect such a compliment did not you did for you but that is one great difference between us compliments always take you by surprise and me never what could be more natural than his asking you again he could not help seeing that you were about times as pretty as every other woman in the room no thanks to his gallantry for that well he certainly is very agreeable and i give you leave to like him you have liked many a person dear i oh you are a great deal too apt you know to like people in general you never see a fault in any body all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life i would wish not to be hasty in any one but i always speak what i think i know you do and it is that which makes the wonder with your good sense to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others affectation of is common enough one meets with it every where but to be candid without or design â to take the good of every body s character and make it still better and say nothing of the bad â belongs to you alone and so you like this man s sisters too do you their manners are not equal to his certainly not at first but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them miss is to live with her brother and keep his house and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her elizabeth listened in silence but was not convinced their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to b in general and with more of and of temper than her sister and with a judgment too hj any attention to herself she was very little disposed to approve them they were in fact yery fine ladies not deficient in good humour when were pleased nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it but proud and conceited they were rather handsome had been educated in one of the first private in town had a fortune of twenty thou sand pounds were in the habit of spending more than they ought and of with people of rank and were therefore in every respect entitled to think of themselves and of others they were of a respectable family in the north of â a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother s fortune and own had been acquired by trade mr inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from his father who had intended to purchase an estate but did not live to do it mr intended it likewise and sometimes made choice of his county but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the of his temper whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at field and leave the next generation to purchase his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own but though he was now established only as a tenant miss was by no means unwilling to at his table nor was mrs who had married a man of more fashion than fortune less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her mr had not l een of age two years 
1,when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at house he did look at it and into it for half an hour was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms satisfied with what the owner said in its praise and took it between him and there was a very steady ship in spite of a great opposition of character bin y ard prejudice was to by the and of his though no offer it greater contrast to bis own and though with his own be never appeared dissatisfied on the strength of s re ard bin ey had the reliance and of his judgment ihe highest opinion in understanding was the superior was by no means deficient bat was he was at the same time reserved and fastidious and his manners though bred were not in that respect bis friend bad greatly the e was sure of being liked wherever be appeared was continually giving offence the manner in which they spoke of the assembly was sufficiently characteristic had never met pleasanter people or prettier girls in bis life every body had been most kind and attentive to him there had been no formality no he bad soon felt acquainted with all the room and as to miss he could not conceive an angel more beautiful on the contrary bad seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest and from none received either attention or pleasure miss he acknowledged to be pretty but she smiled too much mrs and her sister allowed it to be so but still they admired her and liked her and pronounced her to be a sweet girl and one whom they should not object to know more of miss was therefore as a sweet girl and their brother by such com to think of h as be chose chapter v within a short walk of lived a family with whom the particularly intimate sir william bad been formerly in trade in where he pride and prejudice had made a tolerable fortune and to the honour of by an address to the king during his the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town and them both he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from from that period lodge where he could think with pleasure of his own importance and by business occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world for though elated by his rank it did not render him on the contrary he was all attention to every body by nature friendly and obliging his at st james s had made him courteous lady was a very good kind of woman not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to mrs they had several children the eldest of them a sensible intelligent young woman about twenty seven was s intimate friend that the miss and the miss should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary and the morning after the assembly brought the former to long to hear and to communicate you began the evening well said mrs with civil self command to miss you were mr s first choice yes but he seemed to like his second better oh you mean jane i suppose because he danced with her twice to be sure that did seem as if he admired her â indeed i rather believe he did â i heard something about it â but i hardly know what â something about mi robinson perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr robinson did not i mention it to you mr robinson s asking him how he liked our and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room and which he thought the prettiest and his answering immediately to the last question oh the eldest miss beyond a doubt there cannot be two opinions on that point and upon my word well that was very decided indeed â that does seem as if but however it may all come to nothing you know my were more to the purpose than yours said mr is not so well worth listening to as his friend is he poor to be only just tolerable i beg you will not put it into s head to be vexed by his ill treatment for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him mrs long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips are you quite sure ma am is not there a little mistake said jane i certainly saw mr speaking to her ay because she asked him at last how he and he could not help answering her but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to miss told me said jane that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance with them he is remarkably agreeable i do not believe a word of it my dear if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to mrs long but i can guess how it was every body says that he is eat up with pride and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs long does not keep a carriage and had come to the ball in a hack chaise i do not mind his not talking to mrs long said miss but i wish he had danced with another time said her mother i would not dance with him if i were you i believe ma am i may safely promise you never to dance with him his pride said miss does not offend me so much as pride often does because there 
2,is an excuse for it one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man with family fortune every thing in his favour should think highly of himself if i may so express it he has a right to be proud pride and prejudice that is very true replied elizabeth and i could easily forgive his pride if be had not mine pride observed mary who herself upon the of her reflections is a very common failing i believe by all that i have ever read i am convinced that it is very common indeed that human nature is particularly prone to it and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self complacency on the score of some quality or other real or imaginary vanity and pride are different things though the words are often used a person may be proud without being vain pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves vanity to what we would have others think of us if i were as rich as mr cried a young who came with his sisters i should not care how proud i was i would keep a pack of and drink a bottle of wine every day then you would drink a great deal more than you ought said mrs and if i were to see you at it i should take away your bottle directly the boy protested that she should not she continued to declare that she would and the argument ended only with the visit chapter vi the ladies of soon waited on those of the visit was returned in due form miss pleasing manners grew on the good will of mrs and miss and though the mother was to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth to a wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the two eldest by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure but still saw in their treatment of every body hardly excepting even her sister and could not like them though their kindness to jane such as it was had a value as i pride and prejudice arising in all probability from the influence of their brother s admiration it was generally evident whenever they met that he did admire her and to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had b un to entertain for him from the and was in a way to be very much in love but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general since jane united with great strength of feelings a composure of temper and an uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her firom the suspicions of the impertinent she mentioned this to hei friend miss it may perhaps be pleasant replied to be able to impose on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded if a woman her affection with the same skill m the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself we can all begin freely â a slight preference is natural enough but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement in nine cases out of ten a woman had better show more affection than she feels likes your sister undoubtedly but he may never do more than like her if she does not help him on but she does help him on as much as her nature will allow if can perceive her regard for him he must be a indeed not to discover it too remember â that he does not know jane s disposition as you do but if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavour to conceal it he must find it out perhaps he must if he sees enough of her but though and jane meet tolerably often it is never for many hours together and as tbey always see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention when she is secure pride and prejudice of him there will be leisure for falling in love as much ai she chooses your plan is a good one replied elizabeth when nothing is in question but the desire of being well married and if i were determined to get a rich husband or a iy husband i dare say i should adopt it but these are not jane s feelings she is not acting by as yet she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own r ard nor of its she has known him only a fort night she danced four dances with him at she saw him one morning at his own house and has since dined in company with him four times this is not quite enough to make her understand his character not as you represent it had she merely dined with him she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together â and four evenings may do a great deal yes these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like un better than commerce but with respect to any other leading characteristic i do not imagine that much has been unfolded well said i wish jane success with all my heart and if she were married to him to morrow i should think she had as good a chance of 
2,happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand it does not their felicity in the least they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your ufe you make me laugh but it is not sound you know it is not sound and that you would never act in this way yourself occupied in observing mr s attentions to her sister elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his pride and prejudice friend mr had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty he had looked at her without admiration at the ball and when they next met he looked at her only to but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes to this discovery succeeded some others equally ing though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect in her form he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world he was caught by their easy of this she was perfectly unaware to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with he began to wish to know more of her and as a step towards conversing with her himself attended to her con with others his doing so drew her notice it was at sir william s where a large party were assembled what does mr mean said she to by listening to my conversation with colonel that is a question which mr only can answer but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about he has a very eye and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself j shall soon grow afraid of on his approaching them soon afterwards though without seeming to have any intention of speaking miss defied her friend to mention such a subject to him which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it she turned to him and said â did not you think mr that i expressed myself well just now when i was colonel to give us a ball at with great energy but it is a subject which makes a lady energetic pride and prejudice ft you are severe on us it will be her turn soon to be said i am going to open the instrument and you know what follows you are a very strange creature by way of a friend â always wanting ine to play and sing before any body and every body if my vanity had taken a you would have been invaluable but as it is i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best on miss s however she added very well if it must be so it must and gravely glancing at mr there is a very fine old saying which every body here is of course familiar with â keep your breath to cool your â and i shall keep mine to swell my song her performance was pleasing though by no means capital after a song or two and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary who having in consequence of being the only plain one in the family worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments was always impatient for display mary had neither genius nor taste and though vanity had given her application it had given her likewise a air and conceited manner which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached â li easy and unaffected had been listened to with much more pleasure though not playing half so well and mary at the end of a long was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs at the request of her sisters who with some of the and two or three officers joined eagerly in at one end of the room mr stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening to the of all con and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william was his neighbour till sir william thus began â what a charming amusement for young people this is mr there is nothing like dancing after all i pride and prejudice â i consider it as one of the first of polished societies certainly sir and it has the advantage also of being in amongst the less polished societies of the world every savage can dance sir william only smiled your friend de he continued after a pause on seeing join tlie group and i not that you are an in the science yourself mr you saw me dance at i eve sir yes indeed and received no pleasure from the sight do you often dance at st james s never sir do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place it is a compliment which i never pay to any place if i can avoid it you have a house in town conclude mr bowed i had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself for i am fond of 
2,superior society but i did not feel quite certain that the air of london would agree with lady he paused in hopes of an answer but his companion was not disposed to make any and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing and called out to her â my dear miss â why are not you dancing mr you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner you cannot refuse to dance i am sure when so much beauty is before you and taking her hand he would have given it to mr who though extremely surprised was not unwilling to receive it when she instantly drew back and said with some to sir william â indeed sir i have not the least intention of dancing i entreat you not to suppose that i moved this way in order to beg for a partner mr with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand but in vain elizabeth was de c c c pride and prejudice nor did sir william at all shake her purpose h his attempt at persuasion you so much in the dance miss that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you and though this gentleman the amusement in general he can have no i am sure to us for one half hour mr is all politeness said smiling he is indeed hut considering the my dear miss we cannot wonder at his for who would to such a partner elizabeth looked and turned away her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman and he was thinking of her with some complacency when thus by miss â i can guess the subject of your reverie i should imagine not you are considering how it would be to pass many evenings in this manner â in such society and indeed i quite of your opinion i was never more annoyed the and yet the noise â the and yet the self importance of all these people what would i give to hear your on them your conjecture is totally wrong i assure you my mind was more agreeably engaged i have been on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow miss immediately fixed her eyes on his face and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections mr replied with great â miss elizabeth â miss elizabeth repeated miss i am all astonishment how long has she been such a favourite and pray when am i to wish you joy that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask a lady s imagination is very rapid it from admiration to love from love to matrimony in a moment i knew you would be wishing me joy nay if you are so serious about it i shall consider pride and prejudice s the matter as absolutely settled you will have a charming mother in indeed and of course she will be always at with you he listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to entertain herself in this manner and as his composure her that all was safe her wit flowed long chapter vii mb s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year which unfortunately for his daughters was in of male on a distant relation and their mother s fortune though ample for her situation in could but ill supply the deficiency of his her father had been an attorney in and had left her four thousand pounds she had a sister married to a mr who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business and a brother settled in london in a respectable line of trade the village of was only one mile from a most convenient distance for the young ladies who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week to pay their duty to their aunt and to a s shop just over the way the two youngest of the family and were particularly frequent in these attentions their minds were more vacant than their sisters and when nothing better offered a walk to was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening and however bare of news the country in general might be they always contrived to learn some from their aunt at present indeed they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent ar rival of a regiment in the neighbourhood it was to remain the whole winter and was the head quarters c pride and prejudice their visits to mrs were now productive of the most interesting intelligence every day added something to their knowledge of the officers names and connections their lodgings were not long a secret and at length they began to know the officers themselves mr visited them all and this opened to his a source of felicity unknown before they could talk of nothing but officers and mr s large fortune the mention of which gave animation to their mother was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the of an after listening one morning to their on this subject mr coolly observed â from all that i can collect by your manner of talking you must be two of the girls in the country i have suspected it some time but i am now convinced was disconcerted and made no answer but with perfect indifference continued to express her admiration of captain and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day as he was going die next morning to london i am astonished my dear said mrs that you should be so to think your own children silly if i wished to think of any body 
2,s children it should not be of my own however if my children are silly j must hope to be always sensible of it yes but as it happens they are all of them very clever this is the only point i flatter myself on which we do not agree i had hoped that our sentiments in every particular but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish my dear mr you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very well â and indeed so i do still at my heart and if a smart young colonel with ye or six thousand a year should want one of my girls i shall not nay nay to him and i thought v nâ t pride and prejudice becoming the other night at sir william s in his r i mamma cried my aunt says that colonel i and captain do not go so often to miss s as they did when they first came she sees them now very often standing in s library mrs was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss it came from and the servant waited for an answer mrs s eyes sparkled with pleasure and she was eagerly calling out while her daughter read â well jane who is it from is it about what does he say well jane make haste and tell us make haste my love it is from miss said jane and then read it aloud my dear friend if you are not so compassionate as to dine to day with and me we shall be in danger of each other for the rest of our lives for a whole day s d between two women can never end without a quarrel come as soon as you can on the receipt of this my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers yours ever with the officers cried i wonder my aunt did not tell us of that dining out said mrs that is very un can i have the carriage said jane no my dear you had better go on horseback because t seems likely to rain and then you must stay all night that would be a good scheme said elizabeth if oa were sure that they would not offer to send her home oh but the gentlemen will have mr s chaise go to and the have no horses to theirs i had much rather go in the coach my your father cannot spare x pride and prejudice am sure they are wanted in the mr are not they they are wanted in the farm much oftener than i can get them but if you have got them to day said my mother s purpose will he answered she did at last from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged jane was therefore to go on and her mother attended her to the door with many of a had day her hopes were answered jane had not heen gone long it rained hard her sisters were uneasy for her hut her mother was delighted the rain continued the whole evening without jane certainly could not come hack this was a lucky idea of mine indeed said mrs more than once as if the credit of making it rain were all her own till the next morning however she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from the following note for â â my dearest i find myself very this morning which i suppose is to he to my getting wet through yesterday my kind friends will not hear of my returning home till i am they insist also on my seeing mr jones â therefore do not he alarmed if you should hear of his having heen to me â and excepting a and headache there is not much the matter with me yours c well my dear said mr when elizabeth had read the note aloud if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness if she should die it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr and under your orders oh i am not at all afraid of her dying people do not die of little trifling she will he taken good care pride and prejudice of as long as she stays there it is all very well i would go and see her if i could have the carriage elizabeth feeling really anxious was determined to go to her though the carriage was not to be had and as she was no walking was her only alternative she declared her resolution how can you he so silly cried her mother as to think of such a thing in all this dirt you will not be fit to be seen when you get there i shall be very fit to see jane â which is all i want is this a hint to me said her father to send for the horses no indeed i do not wish to avoid the walk the distance is nothing when one has a motive only three miles i shall be back by dinner i admire the activity of your benevolence observed mary but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason and in my opinion exertion should always be in proportion to what is required we will go as far as with you said and elizabeth accepted their company and the three young ladies set off together if we make haste said as they walked along perhaps we may see something of captain before he 
3,goes in they parted the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers and elizabeth continued her walk alone crossing field after field at a quick pace jumping over and springing over with impatient activity and finding herself at last within view of the house with weary ankles dirty stockings and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise she was into the breakfast parlour where all but jane were assembled and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise that she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such dirty weather and by herself was almost incredible to mrs and miss and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it she was received however very politely by them and in their brother s manners there was and prejudice something better than politeness there was ood humour and kindness mr said very little and mr nothing at all the former was divided between admiration oâ the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to the occasion s her coming so far alone the latter was thinking only of his breakfast her after her sister were not very answered miss had slept ill and though up was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately and jane who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit was delighted at her entrance she was not equal however to much conversation and when miss left them together could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the ex kindness was treated with elizabeth silently attended her when breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters and elizabeth began to like them herself when she saw how much affection and solicitude they showed for jane the came and having examined his patient said as might be supposed that she had caught a violent cold and that they must endeavour to get the better of it advised her to return to bed and promised her some draughts the advice was followed readily for the feverish symptoms increased and her head ached elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment nor were the other ladies often absent the gentlemen being out they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere when the clock struck three elizabeth felt that she must go and very unwillingly said so miss offered her the carriage and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it when jane such concern in parting with her that miss was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at for the present elizabeth most consented and a servant was despatched to to the family with stay ba ck supply of clothes and chapter viii o clock the two ladies retired to dress and at half c elizabeth was summoned to dinner to the civil es which then poured in and amongst which she pleasure of the much superior mr s she could not make a very jane was by no means better the sisters ring this repeated three or four times how much ere grieved how shocking it was to have a bad ind how excessively they disliked being iu them and then thought no more of the matter and their ence towards jane when not immediately before elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her ike ir brother indeed was the only one of the party she could regard with any complacency his for jane was evident and his attentions to herself and they prevented her feeling herself so n intruder as she believed she was considered by ers she had very little notice from any but him was engrossed by mr her sister r less so and as for mr by whom he was an indolent man who lived only to eat ind play at cards who when he found her prefer a to a had nothing to say to her n dinner was over she returned directly to jane ss began her as soon as she was out her manners were pronounced to be very â a mixture of pride and impertinence she had no style no taste no beauty mrs the same and added â e has nothing in to recommend her but n excellent i shall never forget her this morning she really looked t did indeed i co ld very to come and prejudice she be about the country because her sister had a cold her hair so so yes and her i hope you saw her six inches deep in mud i am absolutely certain and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its your picture may be very exact said but this was all lost upon me i thought miss elizabeth looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning her dirty quite escaped my notice you observed it mr i am sure said miss and i am inclined to think that you would not wish to see your sister make such an exhibition certainly not to walk three miles or four miles or five miles or whatever it is above her ankles in dirt and alone quite alone what could she mean by it it seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence a most country town indifference to decorum it shows an affection for her sister that is very ing said am afraid mr observed miss in a half whisper that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes not at all he replied they were brightened by the exercise a short pause followed this speech and mrs began again â i have an excessive regard for jane â she is really a very sweet girl â and i wish with all my heart 
3,she were well settled but with such a father and mother and such low connections i am afraid there is no chance of it think i have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in yes and they have another who lives somewhere near is capital added her sister and they both laughed heartily if they had enough to fill a cried it would not make them one less agreeable pride prejudice â ut it must very lessen their chance of ing men of any consideration in the worlds replied this speech made no answer but his sisters their hearty assent and indulged their mirth for time at tlie expense of their dear friend s vulgar is h a renewal of tenderness however they repaired to m on leaving the dining parlour and sat with her to coffee she was still very poorly and th would not quit her at all till late in die evening ihe had the comfort of seeing her asleep and when to her rather right than pleasant that she should vn stairs herself on entering the drawing room ind the whole party at loo and was immediately into join them but suspecting them to be playing he declined it and making her sister the excuse said amuse herself for the short time she could stay with a book mr looked at her with nt o you prefer reading to cards said he that is singular â said miss she is a great reader and has no pleasure in any deserve neither such praise nor such censure cried th i am u t a great reader and i have pleasure ly i nursing your sister i am sure you have pleasure and i hope it will soon be increased by her quite well thanked him from her heart and then walked s a table where a few books were lying he to fetch her others all that his library d nd i wish my collection were larger for your benefit j own credit but i am an idle fellow and though not many i have more than i ever look into assured him that she could l those in the room s pride and prejudice i am astonished said miss that my father should have left so small a collection of hooks what a delightful library you have at mr it ought to be good he replied it has been the work of many generations and then you have added so much to it yourself â you are always buying books i cannot comprehend the n of a family library in such days as these neglect i am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place charles when you build your house i wish it may be half as delightful as i wish it may but i would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood and take for a kind of model there is not a finer county in england than der with all my heart i will buy itself if will sell it i am talking of charles upon my word i should think it more to get by purchase than by imitation elizabeth was so much caught by what passed as to leave her very little attention for her book and soon laying it wholly aside she drew near ihe card table and stationed herself between mr and his eldest sister to observe the game is miss much grown since the spring said miss will she be as tall as i am i think she will she is now about elizabeth s height or rather taller how i long to see her again i never met with any body who delighted me so much such a count such and so extremely accomplished for her age her performance on the piano is exquisite it is amazing to me said how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they and an young ladies my dear what do you y e au of â thinks they all p t es cover and net i scarcely any one cannot do all this i am i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time without being informed that she was very accomplished your list of the common extent of said has too much truth the word is implied to many a woman who deserve it no otherwise than by a e or covering a screen but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general i cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished nor i i am sure said miss then observed elizabeth you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman yes i do comprehend a great deal in it oh certainly cried his faithful assistant no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly what is usually met with a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing and the modem languages to deserve the word and be sides all this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking the tone of her voice her ad dress and expressions or the word will be but half de served all this she must possess added and to all this she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading i am no longer surprised at your knowing m y six accomplished women i rather wonder now at your knowing any you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this i never saw such a woman never saw such capacity and taste and application and elegance as you describe united si pride and prejudice mrs and miss both cried out against the injustice of her implied 
3,doubt and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description when mr called them to order with bitter complaints of their to what was going forward as all conversation was thereby at an end elizabeth soon afterwards left the room said miss when the door was closed on her is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by their own and with many men i dare say it but in my opinion it is a paltry device a very mean art undoubtedly replied to whom this remark was chiefly addressed there is meanness in the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for whatever bears to cunning is miss was not so entirely satisfied with this re as to continue the subject elizabeth joined them again only to sa j that her sister was worse and that she could not leave her urged mr jones s being sent for immediately while his sisters convinced that no country advice could be of any service recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent this she would not hear of but she was not so unwilling to with their brother s proposal and it was settled that mr jones should be sent for early in the morning if miss were not decidedly better was quite uncomfortable his sisters declared that they were miserable they their wretchedness however by after supper while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister pride and prejudice chapter ix elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister s room and in the morning had the pleasure of able to send a tolerable answer to the which she very early received from mr by a and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters in spite of this how ever she requested to have a note sent to desiring her mother to visit jane and form her own judgment of her situation the note was immediately despatched and its contents as quickly complied with mrs accompanied by her two youngest girls reached soon after the family breakfast had she foimd jane in any apparent danger mrs ben net would have been very miserable but being satisfied on seeing her that her was not alarming she had no wish of her recovering immediately as her restoration to health would probably remove her from she would not listen therefore to her daughter s proposal of being carried home neither did the who arrived about the same time think it at all advisable after sitting a little while with jane on miss s ap and invitation the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour met them with hopes that mrs had not found miss worse than she expected indeed i have sir was her answer she is a great deal too ill to be moved mr jones says we must not think of moving her we must a little longer on your kindness removed cried it must not be thought of my sister i am sure will not hear of her removal you may depend upon it madam said miss with cold civility that miss shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us d pride and prejudice mrs was in her i am sure she added if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would of her for she is very ill indeed and suffers a vast deal though with the greatest patience in the world which is always the way with her for she has without exception the sweetest temper i ever met with i often tell my other girls they are nothing to her you have a sweet room here mr and a charming prospect over that gravel walk i do not know a place in the country that is equal to you will not think of it in a hurry i hope tb you have but a short lease whatever i do is done in a hurry replied he and therefore if i should resolve to quit i should ly be off in five minutes at present however i consider myself as quite fixed here that is exactly what i should have supposed of you said you begin to comprehend me do you cried he turning towards her oh yes â i understand you perfectly i wish i might take this for a compliment but to be so easily seen through i am afraid is that is as it happens it does not necessarily follow that a deep intricate character is more or less than such a one as yours cried her mother remember where you are and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home i did not know before continued immediately that you were a of character it must be an amusing study yes but intricate characters are the amusing they have at least that advantage the country said can in general supply but few subjects for such a study in a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and society but people themselves alter so much that there is something new to be observed in them for ever pride and prejudice yes indeed cried mrs offended by his man ner of mentioning a country neighbourhood i assure you there is quite as much of that going on in the country as in town â very body was surprised and after looking at lier for a moment turned silently away mrs who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him continued her triumph â i cannot see that london has any great advantage over the country for my part except the shops and public places the country is a vast deal pleasanter is not 
3,it mr when i am in the country he replied i never wish to leave it and when i am in town it is pretty much the same they have each their advantages and i can be equally happy in either ay at is because you have the right disposition but that gentleman looking at seemed to think the country was nothing at all indeed mamma you are mistaken said elizabeth blushing for her mother you quite mr he only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town which you must acknowledge to be true â certainly my dear nobody said there were but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood i believe there are few larger i know we dine with four and twenty families but concern for elizabeth could enable to keep his countenance his sister was less delicate and directed her eye towards mr with a very expressive elizabeth for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother s thoughts now asked her if had been at since her coming away yes she called yesterday with her father what an agreeable man sir william is mr â is not he so much the man of fashion so genteel and so easy he has always to say to every j that s c n â breeding and those m j â i d s pride and prejudice very important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter did dine with you no she would go home i fancy she was wanted the for my part mr always keep servants that can do their own work my daughters are brought up differently but every body is to judge for themselves and the are a very good sort of girls i assure you it is a pity they are not handsome not that think so very plain but then she is our particular friend she seems a very pleasant young woman said oh dear yes but you must own she is very plain lady herself has often said so and envied me jane s beauty i do not like to boast of my own child but to be sure jane â one does not often see any body better looking it is what every body says i do not trust my own partiality when she was only fifteen there was a gentle man at my brother s in town so much in love with her that my sister in law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away but however he did not perhaps he thought her too young however he wrote some verses on her and very pretty they were and so ended his affection said elizabeth impatiently there has been many a one i fancy overcome in the same way i wonder who first discovered the of poetry in driving away love i have been used to consider poetry as the food of love said of a fine stout healthy love it may every thing what is strong already but if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination i am convinced that one good will starve it entirely away only smiled and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again she longed to speak but could think of nothing to say and after a short silence mrs began repeating her thanks to mr le s u jane with an apology for i i â o c pride and mr was civil in his answer and forced his younger sister to be civil also and say what the sion required she performed her part indeed without much but mrs was satisfied and soon afterwards ordered her carriage upon this signal the youngest of her daughters put herself forward the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit and the result of it was that the youngest should tax mr with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at was a stout well grown girl of fifteen with a fine complexion and good humoured countenance a favourite with her mother whose affection had brought her into public at an early age she had high animal spirits and a sort of natural self consequence which the attentions of the officers to whom her uncle s good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her had increased into assurance she was very equal therefore to address air on the subject of the ball and abruptly reminded him of his promise adding that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to her mother s ear i am perfectly ready i assure you to keep my engagement and when your sister is recovered you shall if you please name the very day of the ball but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill declared herself satisfied oh yes â it would be much better to wait till jane was well and by that time most likely captain would be at again and when you have given your ball she added i shall insist on their giving one also i shall tell colonel it will be quite a shame if he does not mrs and her daughters then departed and elizabeth returned instantly to jane leaving her own and her relations behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr the latter of whom however could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her in spite of all miss r s on fine eyes d pride and prejudice chapter x the day passed much as the day before had done mrs and miss had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid who continued though slowly to 
4,mend and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawing room the loo table however did not appear mr was writings and miss seated near him was the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling oft his attention by messages to his sister mr and mr were at and mrs was observing their game elizabeth took tip some and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between and his companion the perpetual of the either on bis hand writing or on the of his lines or on the length of his letter with the perfect with which her praises were received a curious dialogue and was exactly in with her opinion of each how miss will be to receive such a letter he made no answer you write uncommonly fast you are mistaken i write rather slowly how many letters you have occasion to write in the of a year letters f too i how odious i should think them it is fortunate then that they fall to my lot of to yours pray tell your sister that i long to see her i have already told her so by your desire i am afraid you do not like your pen let me it for you i mend pens remarkably well you â but i always mend my own how can you contrive to write so even was and tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improve on die harp and pray let her know that i am quite id with her beautiful little design for a table and i think it infinitely superior to miss s will you give me leave to your till i write again at present i have not room to do them justice oh it is of no consequence i shall see her in january but do you always write such charming long letters to her mr they are generally long but whether always charm it is not for me to determine it is a rule with me that a person who can write a long letter with ease cannot write ill that will not do for a compliment to cried her brother because he does not write with ease he studies too much for words of four do not you my style of writing is very different from yours oh cried miss charles writes in the most careless way imaginable he leaves out half his words and the rest my ideas flow so rapidly that i have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at au to my your humility mr said elizabeth must reproof nothing is more said than the appearance of humility it is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes an boast and which of the two do you call my little recent piece of modesty the boast for you are really proud of your defects in writings because you consider as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of which if not you think at least highly interesting the power of doing any thing with quick ness is always much by the possessor and often without any attention to the oi when you told mrs pride and prejudice you ever resolved on you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very in a which must leave very necessary business undone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else nay cried this is too much to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning and yet upon my honour i believed what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at this moment at least therefore i did not assume the character of merely to show off before the ladies i dare say you believed it but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such your conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man i know and if as you were mounting your horse a friend were to say you had better stay till next week you would probably do it â you would probably not go â and at another word might stay a month you have only proved by this cried elizabeth that mr did not do justice to his own disposition you have shown him off now much more than he did himself i am exceedingly gratified said by your what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend for he would certainly think the better of me if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as i could would mr then consider the of your original intention as for by your obstinacy in to it upon my word i cannot explain the matter â i must speak for himself you expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine but which i have never acknowledged allowing tiie case however to stand according to your you must et m s x friend who is supposed to desire lo pride and prejudice and the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety to yield readily â easily â to the persuasion of a is no merit wi you to yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either you appear to me mr to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection a regard for the would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it i sm not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed 
4,about mr we may as well wait per till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for with the desire without waiting to be argued into it will it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject to arrange rather more precision the degree of importance which is to to this request as well as the degree of intimacy between the parties by all means cried let us hear all the particulars not forgetting their comparative height and size for that will have more weight in the argument miss than you may be aware of i assure you that if were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much de i declare i do not know a more awful object than on particular occasions and in particular places at his own house especially and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do mr smiled but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended and therefore checked her laugh miss warmly resented the he had received in an her brother for talking such nonsense i see your design said his friend you dislike an argument and want to silence this pride and prejudice perhaps i do arguments are too much like if you and miss will yours till i am out of the room i shall be very thankful and then you may say whatever you like of me what you ask said elizabeth is no sacrifice on my side and mr had much better finish his letter mr took her advice and did finish his letter that business was over he applied to miss and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music miss moved with alacrity to the piano and after a polite request that would lead the way which the other as and more earnestly she seated herself mrs sang with her sister and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument how frequently mr s eyes were fixed on her she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration t so great a man and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange she could only imagine however at last that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and according to his ideas of right than in any other person present the supposition did not pain her she liked him too little to care for his approbation after playing some italian songs miss varied the charm by a lively scotch air and soon afterwards mr near elizabeth said to her â do not you feel a great inclination miss to seize such an opportunity of dancing a she smiled but made no answer he repeated the question with some surprise at her silence oh said she i heard you before but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply you wanted me i know to say yes that you might have the pleasure of my taste but i always delight in those kinds of and a person of their contempt i have therefore made up my mind to tell you that i do not want to dance a at all and now despise me if you dare pride a ij prejudice indeed i do not dare elizabeth having rather expected to him was amazed at his gallantry but there was a mixture of sweetness and in her manner which made it difficult her to any body and had been so by any woman as he was by her he really believed that were it not for the inferiority of her con he should be in some danger miss saw or suspected enough to be jealous and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of elizabeth she often tried to provoke into her by talking of their supposed marriage and planning his happiness in an alliance i hope said she as they were walking together in the the next day you will give your law a few hints when this desirable event takes place as to the advantage of holding her tongue and if you can compass it do cure the younger girls of running after the officers and if i may mention so delicate a subject endeavour to check that little something on conceit and impertinence which your lady possesses have you any thing else to propose for my domestic oh yes do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt be placed in the gallery at put them next to your great uncle the judge they are in the same profession you know only in different lines as for your elizabeth s picture you must not attempt to have it taken for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes it would not be easy indeed to catch their expression but their colour and shape and the so remarkably fine might be copied at that moment they were met from another walk by mrs and elizabeth herself i did not know that you intended to walk said miss in some confusion lest they had been overheard y m used us ill answered mrs pride and prejudice running away without telling us that you were out then taking the disengaged arm of mr she left elizabeth to walk by herself the path just admitted three mr felt their and immediately said â this walk is not wide enough for our party we had better go into the avenue but elizabeth who had not the least 
4,inclination to remain with them answered â no no stay where you are you are and appear to uncommon advantage the picturesque would be by admitting a fourth good by she then ran off rejoicing as she about in the hope of being at home again in a day or two jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening tf chapter xl when the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to her sister and seeing her well guarded from cold attended her into the drawing room where she was by her two friends with many professions of pleasure and elizabeth had never seen so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared their powers of conversation were con they could describe an entertainment with accuracy relate an anecdote with humour and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit but when the gentlemen entered jane was no longer the first object miss s eyes were instantly turned towards and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps he addressed himself directly to miss with a polite mr also made her a â v â very glad but and pride and prejudice s he was full of joy and attention the first half hour was spent in up the fire lest she should from the change of room and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fireplace that she might he farther from the door he then sat down hy her and talked scarcely to any one else â at work in the opposite comer saw it all with great delight when tea was over mr reminded his sister in law of the card â hut in vain she had obtained private intelligence that mr did not wish for cards and mr soon found even his open petition r she assured him that no one intended to play and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her mr had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the and go to sleep took up a book miss did the same and mrs principally occupied in playing with her brace lets and rings joined now and then in her brother s conversation with miss miss s attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr s progress through his book as in reading her own and she was perpetually either making some or looking at his page she could not win him however to any conversation he merely answered her question and read on at length quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his she gave a great and said how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading how much sooner one of any thing of a book when i have a house of my own i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library no one made any reply she the yawned again threw aside her book and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss she turned suddenly towards him and said â by the by charles are you really serious in a dance at i would aa you determine on it to consult the oi v aft pride and party i am much mistaken if there are not some us to a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure if you mean cried her brother he may go to bed if he chooses before it beg â but as for the ball it is quite a settled thing and as soon as has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards i should like infinitely better she replied if they were carried on in a manner but there is something tedious in the usual process of such a meeting it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day much more rational my dear i dare say but it would not be near so much like a miss made no answer and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room her figure was elegant and she walked well but at whom it was all aimed was still in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more and turn ing to elizabeth said â miss â let me persuade you to follow my example and take a turn about the room i assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude elizabeth was surprised but agreed to it immediately miss succeeded no less in the real of her civility mr looked up he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be and unconsciously closed his book he was di invited to join their party but he declined it observing that he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down the room together with either of which motives his joining them would interfere what could he mean she was dying to know what could be his meaning â and asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him not at all was her answer but depend upon it he to be severe on us and our t way of him will be to ask a x miss however was incapable of mr in any things and therefore in an explanation of his two motives i have not the smallest objection to explaining them said he as soon as she allowed him to speak either choose this method of passing the evening because you are in each other s confidence and have 
4,secret affairs to discuss or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking if the first i should be completely in your way and if the second i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire oh shocking cried miss i never heard any thing so abominable how shall we punish him for such a speech nothing so easy if you have but the inclination said â we can ail plague and punish one another him â laugh at him intimate as you are you must know how it is to be done but upon my honour i do not i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that calmness of temper and presence of mind no no i feel he may defy us there and as to laughter we will not expose ourselves if you please by attempting to laugh without a subject mr may himself mr is not to be laughed at cried elizabeth that is an uncommon advantage and uncommon i hope it will continue for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance i dearly love a laugh miss said he has given me credit for more than can be the wisest and best of men â nay the wisest and best of their actions â may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke certainly replied elizabeth there are such people but i hope i am not one of them i hope i never ridicule what is wise or good follies and nonsense and do divert me i own and i laugh at them whenever i can but these i suppose are precisely what you are without perhaps that ia not possible fox any b x aa pride and been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses often expose a strong understanding to ridicule such as vanity and pride yes vanity is a weakness indeed but pride â where there is a real superiority of mind â pride will be always under good elizabeth turned away to hide a smile your examination of mr is over i presume said miss and pray what is the result i am perfectly convinced by it that mr has no defect he owns it himself without disguise no said i have made no such i have faults enough but they are not i hope of understanding my temper i dare not for it is believe too little yielding certainly too little for the convenience of the world i cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as ought nor their against myself my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them my temper would perhaps be called my good opinion once lost is lost for ever c that is a failing indeed cried elizabeth resentment is a shade in a character but you have chosen your fault well i really cannot laugh at it you are safe from me there is i believe in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil a natural defect which not even the best education can overcome and your defect is a to hate every body and yours he replied with a smile is to them do let us have a little music cried miss tired of a conversation in which she had no share you will not mind my waking mr her sister made not the smallest objection and the piano was opened and after a few moments recollection was not sorry for it he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention pride and prejudice chapter xii in consequence of an agreement between the sisters elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother to beg that the carriage might be sent for in the course of the day but mrs who had calculated on her daughters remaining at till the following tuesday which would exactly finish jane s week could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before her answer therefore was not at least not to elizabeth s wishes for she was impatient to get home mrs sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday an in her it was added that if mr and his sister pressed them to stay longer she could spare them very well against staying longer however elizabeth was positively resolved â nor did she much expect it would be asked and fearful on the contrary of being considered as themselves long she urged jane to borrow mr s carriage immediately and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving that morning should be mentioned and the request made the communication excited many professions of concern and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane and till the morrow their going was deferred miss was then sorry that she had proposed the delay for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon and repeatedly tried to persuade miss that it would not be safe for her â that she was not enough recovered j but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right to mr it was welcome intelligence elizabeth had been at long enough i more than he liked and miss vâ a â pride and and more than usual to himself he wisely solved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him â nothing that could her with the hope of his felicity sensible that if such an idea had been suggested his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in or crushing it steady to his purpose he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of 
5,saturday and though they were at one time left by for half an hour he most to his book and would not even look at her on sunday after morning service the separation so agreeable to almost all took place miss bin y s civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly as well as affection for jane and when they parted after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at or and embracing hei most tenderly she even shook hands with the former elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the spirits they were not welcomed home very cordially by mother mrs wondered at their coming and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble and was sure jane would have caught cold again but their father though very in his expressions of pleasure was really glad to see them he had felt their importance in the family circle the evening conversation when they were all assembled had lost much of its animation and almost all its sense by the absence of jane and they found mary as usual deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature and had some new to admire and some new observations of thread bare mo to listen to and had information for them of a different sort much had been done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding a j several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle a private had been and it had actually fe that a o i a â m d pride and prejudice chapter xiii i hope my dear said mr to his wife as they were at breakfast the next morning that you have ordered a good dinner to day because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party who do you mean my dear i know of nobody that is coming i am sure unless should happen to call in and i hope my dinners are good enough for her i do not believe she often sees such at home the person of whom i speak is a gentleman and a stranger mrs eyes sparkled a gentleman and a stranger it is mr i am sure why jane â you never dropped a word of this â you sly thing i well i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr but â good lord how unlucky there is not a bit of fish to be got to day my love ring the bell i must speak to hill this moment it is not mr said her husband it is a person whom i never saw in the whole course of my life this roused a general astonishment and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once after amusing himself some time with their curiosity he thus explained â about a month ago i received this letter and about a fortnight ago i answered it for thought it a case of some delicacy and requiring early attention it is from my cousin mr who when i am dead may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases oh my dear cried his wife i cannot bear to hear that mentioned pray do not talk of that odious man i do think it is the hardest thing in the world that your estate should be away from your own children and i am sure if i had been you i should have u w j o to do something or other about it jane and attempted to ex am lo e pride and prejudice nature of an they had often attempted it before but it was a subject on mrs was beyond the reach of reason and continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters in favour of a man whom nobody cared any thing about it certainly is a most affair said mr and nothing can clear mr from the guilt of but if you will listen to his letter you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself no that i am sure i shall not and i think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all and very i hate such false friends why could no he keep on quarrelling with you as his father did before him why indeed he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head as you will hear near th october dear sir the between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness and since i have had the misfortune to lose him i have frequently wished to heal the breach but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts fearing lest it might seem to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one whom it had always pleased him to be at â there mrs â my mind however is now made up on the subject for having received at i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right able lady de widow of sir de whose and has preferred me to the valuable of this parish where it shall be my earnest endeavour to myself with grateful respect towards her and he ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are by the church of england as clergyman e to promote and establish the blessing oi e ic â j iâ pride and prejudice within the reach of my influence and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present of good wi l are highly and that the circumstance of my next in the of estate will he kindly overlooked on your side and not lead you to reject the offered olive i 
5,cannot he otherwise than concerned at the means of your daughters and beg leave to for it as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends but of this hereafter if you should have no objection to receive me into your house i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your fan y monday november th by four o clock and shall probably on your till the saturday se following which i can do without any inconvenience as lady is far from to my occasional absence on a sunday provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day i remain dear sir with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters your well and friend william at four o clock therefore we may expect this gentleman said mr as he folded up the letter he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man upon my word and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance especially if lady should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again there is some sense in what he says about die girls however and if he is disposed to make them any amends i shall not be the person to him though it is difficult said jane to guess in what way he can mean to make us the he thinks our due the wish is certainly to his credit elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for lady and his kind intention of marrying and burying his it were required he must be an i think said ve make bim there is ven u pride and prejudice style and what can he mean by for next in the we cannot suppose he would help it if he could can he be a sensible man sir no my dear i think not i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse there is a mixture of and self importance in his letter which promises well i am impatient to see him in point of composition said mary his letter does not seem the idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new yet i think it is well expressed to and neither the letter nor its writer were in any interesting it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour as for their mother mr s letter had done away much of her ill wiu and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters mr was punctual to his time and was received with great politeness by the whole family mr indeed said little but the ladies were ready enough to talk and mr seemed neither in need of encouragement nor inclined to be silent himself he was a tall heavy looking young man of five and twenty his air was grave and stately and his manners were very formal he had not been long seated before he mrs on having so fine a family of daughters said he had heard much of their beauty but that in this instance fame had fallen short of the truth and added that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers but mrs who quarrelled with no compliments answered most readily â you are very kind sir i am sure and i wish with all my heart it may prove so for else they will be destitute enough things are settled so oddly you allude perhaps to the of this estate ah sir i do indeed it is a grievous affair to my poor girls you must confess ol x xv vi ud with you for such things â te â o i â and world there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be am very sensible madam of the hardship to my fair cousins and could say much on the subject but i am cautious of appearing forward and but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them at present i will not say more but perhaps when we are better acquainted he was interrupted by a summons to dinner and the girls smiled on each other they were not the only objects of mr s admiration the hall the dining room and all its furniture were examined and praised and his of every thing would have mrs s heart but for the supposition of his it all as his own future property the dinner too in its turn was highly admired and he begged to know to of his fair cousins the excellence of its was owing but here he was set right by mrs who assured him with some that they were very well able to keep a good cook and that her daughters had no thing to do in the kitchen he begged pardon for having displeased her in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended but he continued to for about a quarter of an hour chapter xiv dinner mr scarcely spoke at all but when the servants were withdrawn he thought it time have some conversation with his guest and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his lady de s attention to his wishes and consider for his comfort appeared very remarkable mr could not have chosen better mr was in her praise the subject e en a than of iâ x â x pride and aspect he protested that he had never in his life y such behaviour in a person of rank â such and condescension 
5,as he had himself experienced from lady she had been graciously pleased to approve of both the which he had already had the honour of preaching before her she had also asked him twice to dine at and had sent for him only the saturday before to make up her pool of in the evening lady was reckoned proud by many people he knew but he had never seen any thing but in her she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman i e made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to bis leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two to visit his relations she had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could provided he chose with discretion and had once paid him a visit in his humble where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making and had even vouchsafed to suggest some â some shelves in the up stairs that is all very proper and civil i am sure said mrs and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her does she live near you sir the garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from park her lady ship s residence i think you said she was a widow sir has she any family she has one only daughter the of and of very extensive property ah cried mrs shaking her head then she is better off than many girls and what sort of lady is she is she handsome she is a charming young lady indeed lady herself says that in point of true beauty miss de is far superior to the of her sex because there is that in her w v xv b j woman of distinguished birth v i e and constitution which has prevented her making thai progress in many accomplishments which she could otherwise have failed of as i am informed by the lady who her education and who still with them but she is perfectly amiable and often con to drive by my humble abode in her little and has she been presented i do not remember her name among the ladies at court her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town and by that means as i told lady myself one day has deprived the british court of its bright est ornament her seemed pleased with the idea and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to o r those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies i have more than once observed to lady that her charming daughter seemed bom to be a and that the most elevated rank instead of giving her consequence would be adorned by her these are the kind of little things which please her ship and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay you judge very properly said mr and il is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy may i ask whether these pleasing tions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are the result of previous study they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions i always wish to give them as an air as possible mr s expectations were fully answered his cousin was as absurd as he had hoped and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth requiring no partner in his pleasure by however the dose had mr was glad to take his wâ v pride and prejudice room again and when tea was over glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies mr readily assented and book was produced but on beholding it for every thing announced it to be from a library he started back and begging pardon protested that he never read novels stared at him and exclaimed other books were produced and after some deliberation he chose s sermons as he opened the volume and before he had with very monotonous solemnity read three pages she interrupted him with â do you know mamma that my uncle talks of turning away richard and if he does colonel will hire him my aunt told me so herself on saturday i shall walk to to morrow to hear more about it and to ask when mr comes back from town was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue but mr much offended laid aside his book and said â i have often observed how little young ladies are in by books of a serious stamp though written solely for their benefit it me i confess for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction but i will no longer my young cousin then turning to mr he offered himself as his at mr accepted the challenge observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements mrs and her daughters most for s interruption and promised that it should not occur again if he would resume his book but mr after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no and should never resent her behaviour as any seated himself at another table with mr ai d prepared for pride and prejudice chapter xv mr was not a sensible and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society the greatest part of his life having been spent under the of an and father and though he belonged to one of the 
5,he had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful ac the in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner but it was now a good deal by the self conceit of a weak head living in retirement and the feelings of early and unexpected prosperity a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady ca de when the living of was vacant and the respect which he felt for her high i and his veneration for her as his mingling with a very good opinion of himself of liis authority as a clergyman and his right as a made him altogether a mixture of pride and self importance and humility having now a good house and very sufficient income he intended to marry and in seeking a reconciliation with the family he had a wife in view as he meant to choose one of the daughters if he found them as hand same and amiable as they were represented by common report this was his plan of amends â of â for their father s estate and he thought it an excellent one full of and and ex generous and disinterested on his own part his plan did not vary on seeing them miss s lovely face confirmed his views and established all his notions of what was due to and for the first evening she was his settled choice the next morning however made an alteration for in a quarter of an hour s with mrs ben net before breakfast a a beginning with his house and leading to of his hopes that a x a e and found at produced from her amid very smiles and general encouragement a caution against the very he had fixed on as to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to say â she could not positively answer â but she did not know of any â her daughter she must just she felt it incumbent on her to hint was likely to be very soon engaged mr had only to from jane to elizabeth â and it was soon done â done while mrs was stirring the fire equally next to jane in birth and beauty succeeded her of course mrs up the hint and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces intention of walking to was not forgotten every sister except mary agreed to go with her and mr was to attend them at the request of mr who was most anxious to get rid of him and have his library to himself for thither mr had followed him after breakfast and there he would continue engaged with one of the largest in the collection but really talking to mr with little of his house and garden at such doings mr exceedingly in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity and though prepared as he told elizabeth to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house he was used to be free from them there his civility therefore was most prompt in inviting mr to join his daughters in their walk and mr being in fact much better fitted for a than a reader was extremely well pleased to close his large book and go in on his side and civil on that of his cousins their time passed till they entered the attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him their eyes were immediately up in the street in l oi q c pride and less than a very smart bonnet indeed or a really new muslin in a shop window could recall them but the attention of every lady was soon caught l a m young man whom they had never seen before of moat appearance walking with an officer on the other side of the way the officer was the very mr whose return from london came to en and he bowed as they passed all were struck with the stranger s air all wondered who he could be and and determined if possible to find out led the i way across the street under pretence of wanting something i in an opposite shop and fortunately had just gained the i pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached i the same spot mr addressed directly and entreated permission to introduce his friend mr who had returned with him the day before from town and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps this was exactly as it should be for the young man wanted only to make him completely charming his appearance was greatly in his favour he had all the best parts of beauty a fine countenance a good figure and very pleasing address the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation â a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably when the sound of horses drew their notice and and were seen riding down the street on the ladies of the group the two gentlemen came directly towards them and began the usual was the principal and miss the principal object he was then he said on his way to on purpose to after her mr it with a bow and was to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other was all astonishment at the of the meeting both changed colour one looked white the other red mr after a touched his hat a salutation which mr â x â and prejudice to 
6,return what could be the meaning of it it was im possible to imagine it was impossible not to long to know in another minute mr but without seeming to have noticed what passed took leave and rode on with his friend mr and mr walked with the young ladies to the door of mr s house and then made their bows in spite of miss s pressing entreaties that they would come in and even in spite of mrs s throwing up the parlour window and loudly the mrs was always glad to see her and the two eldest from their recent absence were particularly welcome and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home which as their own carriage had not fetched them she should have known nothing about if she had not happened to see mr jones s shop boy in the street who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to because the miss were come away when her civility was claimed towards mr by jane s introduction of him she received him with her very best politeness which he returned with as much more for his intrusion without any previous acquaintance with her which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relation ship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice mrs was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and about the other of whom however she could only tell her what they already knew that mr had brought him from london and that he was to have a lieutenant s commission in the she had been watching him the last hour she said as he walked up and down the street and had mr appeared and would certainly have continued the occupation but no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers who in comparison with the stranger were become stupid disagreeable some of te the the next day and lai y aft pride and prejudice her call on mr and give him an invitation also if the family from would come ia the evening this was agreed to and mrs protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of tickets and a little bit of hot supper after wards the prospect of such delights was very cheering and they parted in mutual good spirits mr repeated his apologies in the room and was assured with civility that they were perfectly needless as they walked home â related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen but though jane would have defended either or both had they appeared to be wrong she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister mr on his return highly gratified mrs by admiring mrs s manners and politeness he protested that except lady and her daughter he had never seen a more elegant woman for she had not only received him with the utmost civility but had even included him in her invitation for the next evening although utterly unknown to her before something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life chapter xvi as objection was made to the young people s engagement with their aunt and all mr s scruples of leaving mr and mrs for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to and the girls had the pleasure of hearing as they entered the drawing room that mr had accepted their uncle s invitation and was then in the house when this tion was aiid ie w and their seats mr was at leisure to look and admire and he was so much struck with the furniture of the apartment that he declared he most have supposed himself in the small summer parlour at a comparison that did not at much gratification but when mrs from him what was and who was its when she had listened to the description of only c lady s drawing rooms and found that the alone had cost eight hundred pounds she f the force of the compliment and would hardly hai a comparison with the housekeeper s room in describing to her all the grandeur of lady cat and her mansion with occasional in his own humble abode and the improvements it w he was happily employed until the gentlemen them and he found in mrs a very whose opinion of his consequence increased what she heard and who was to among her neighbours as soon as she could to the who could not listen to their cousin and who had do but to wish for an instrument and examine indifferent of china on the mantel piece tl of waiting appeared very long it was over a however the gentlemen did approach and when walked into the room elizabeth felt that si neither been seeing him before nor thinking of him with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration officers of the were in general a very set and the best of them were of the p party but mr was as far beyond them person countenance air and walk as they were su to the broad faced uncle breathing port who followed into the room mr was the happy man towards whom a every female eye was turned and elizabeth was the i woman by whom he finally seated himself and the able manner in which he immediately fell into though it was only on its being a wet m probability of a rainy season i i aâ x b and most topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker with such for the notice of the fair as 
6,mr and the officers mr seemed to sink into to the young ladies he certainly was nothing bat he had still at intervals a kind listener in mrs and was by her most abundantly supplied with coffee and when the card tables were placed he had an opportunity of obliging her in return by sitting down to i know little of the game at present said he but i shall be glad to improve myself for in my situation of life mrs was very thankful for his compliance but could not wait for his reason mr did not play at and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and at first there seemed danger of s en him entirely she was a most determined but being likewise extremely fond of tickets she soon grew too much interested in the game too eager in making and exclaiming after to have attention for any one in particular allowing for the common demands of the game mr was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth and she was very willing to hear him though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told the history of his acquaintance with mr she dared not even mention that gentleman her curiosity however was unexpectedly mr began the subject himself he how far was from and after receiving her answer asked in a hesitating manner how long mr had been staying there about a month said elizabeth and then unwilling to let the subject drop added he is a man of very large property in i understand yes â replied his estate there is a noble one a clear ten thousand per you could not have met with a person more capable oi certain information on that head than m y to â t f pride and prejudice been connected with his family in a particular from my infancy elizabeth could not but look surprised you may well be surprised miss at such an assertion after seeing as you probably mighty the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday are you much acquainted with mr as much as i ever wish to be cried elizabeth warmly i have spent four days in the same house with him and i think him very disagreeable i have no right to give my opinion said as to his being agreeable or otherwise i am not qualified to form one i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge it is impossible for m to be impartial but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonish â and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly any where else here you are in your own family upon my word i say no more here than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood except he is not at all liked in every body is disgusted with his pride you will not find him more spoken of by any one â i cannot pretend to be sorry said after a short interruption that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts but with him i believe it does not often happen the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence or frightened by his high and imposing manners and sees him only as he chooses to be seen i should take him even on my slight acquaintance to be an ill tempered man only shook his head i wonder said he at the next opportunity of speaking whether he is likely to be in this country much longer i do not at all know but i heard nothing of his going away when i was at i hope your plans in favour of the will not e by his mn in the neighbourhood ob no â it is not for me ea v l pride and if he to avoid me he must go we are not on friendly terms and it always gives me pain to meet him but have no reason for avoiding him hut what i might proclaim to all the world â a sense of very great ill usage and most painful regrets at his being what he is his father miss the late mr was one of the best men that ever breathed and the truest friend i ever had and can never be in company with this mr without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections his behaviour to myself has been scandalous but i verily believe i could forgive him any thing and every thing rather than his the hopes and the memory of his elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase and listened with all her heart but the of it prevented further mr began to speak on more general topics j the neighbourhood the society appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen and speaking of the latter especially with gentle but very intelligible gallantry it was the prospect of constant society and good society he added which was my chief to enter the i know it to be a most respectable agreeable corps and my friend tempted me further by his account of their present quarters and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance had procured them society i own is necessary to me i have been a disappointed man and my spirits will not bear solitude i have employment and society a military life is not what i was intended for but have now made it eligible the church ought to have been my was brought up for the church and i should at this time have been in possession of a valuable living had it pleased t e gentleman we were speaking of just now indeed tc yes â the late mr me the next of the best living in w a god and attached to f prejudice justice to his 
6,kindness he meant to provide for me amply and thought he had it hut when the fell it was given elsewhere good heavens i cried elizabeth bat how could that be how could his will be why did not you seek legal there was just such an in the terms of the as to give me no hope from law a man of honour could not have doubted the intention but mr chose to doubt it â or to treat it as a merely con recommendation and to assert that i had all claim to it by extravagance in any thing or nothing certain it is the living became vacant two years ago exactly as i was of an age to hold it and that it was given to another man and no less certain is it that i cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it i have a warm temper and i may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion of him and to him too freely i can recall nothing worse but the fact is that we are very different sort of men and that he hates me this is quite shocking he deserves to be disgraced some time or other he will be â but it shall not be by me till i can forget his father i can never defy or expose him elizabeth honoured him for such feelings and thought him than ever as he expressed them but what said she after a pause can have been his motive what can have induced him to behave so cruelly a thorough determined dislike of me â a dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy had the late mr liked me less his son might have borne with me better but his father s uncommon attach to me irritated him i believe very early in life he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood â die sort of preference which was often given me j bad not thought mr â o ma â â pride prejudice i have never liked him i had not thought so very ill of him â had him to he his fellow creatures in general but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge such injustice such as this after a few minutes reflection however she continued â remember his one day at of the of his of his having an temper his disposition must be dreadful i will not trust myself on the subject replied i can hardly be just to him elizabeth was again deep in thought and after a time exclaimed to treat in such a manner the friend the favourite of his father she could have added a young man too like whose very countenance may for your being amiable but she contented herself with â and one too who had probably been his own companion from childhood connected together as i think you said in the manner we were born in the same parish within the same park the greatest part of our youth was passed together inmates of the same house sharing the amusements objects of the same parental care my father began life in the profession which your uncle mr appears to do so much credit to but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late mr and devoted all his time to the care of the property he was most highly esteemed by mr a most intimate confidential friend mr often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father s active and when immediately before my father s death mr gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him as of affection to myself how strange cried elizabeth how abominable i wonder that the very pride of this mr has not made him just to you if from no better motive that he ould not have been too proud to be â for i must call it jt wonderful replied x i f pride and prejudice bis may be traced to pride pride has often been his best friend it has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling but we are none of us con and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good yes it has often led him to be liberal and generous to give his money freely to display hospitality to assist his tenants and relieve the poor family pride and filial pride for he is very proud of what his father was have done this not to appear to disgrace his family to from the popular qualities or lose the influence of the house is a powerful motive he has also pride which with affection makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers what sort of a girl is miss he shook his head i wish i could call her amiable it gives me pain to speak ill of a but she is too much like her brother â very proud as a child she was affectionate and pleasing and extremely fond of me and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement but she is nothing to me now she is a handsome girl about fifteen or sixteen and i understand highly accomplished since her father s death her home has been london where a lady lives with her and her education after many pauses and many trials of other subjects elizabeth could not help once more to the first and saying â i am astonished at his intimacy with mr how can mr who seems good humour itself 
6,and is i really believe truly amiable be in friendship with such a man how can they suit each other do you know mr not at all he a sweet tempered am ab e c xv ft cannot know what mr pride and probably not but mr can please where be chooses he does not want abilities he can be a companion if be thinks it worth bis while among those who are at all his equals in consequence he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous his pride never deserts him but with the rich he is just sincere rational honourable and perhaps agreeable â allowing something for fortune and figure the party soon afterwards breaking up the players gathered round the other table and mr took his station between his cousin elizabeth and mrs the usual as to his success were made by the latter it had not been very great he had lost every point but when mrs b an to express her concern thereupon he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance that he considered the money as a mere trifle and begged she would not make herself uneasy i know very well madam said he that when persons sit down to a card table they must take their chance of these things â and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make ye shillings any object there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same but thanks to lady de i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters mr s attention was caught and after ing mr for a few moments he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately with the family of de lady de she replied has very lately given him a living i hardly know how mr was first introduced to her notice but he certainly has not known her long you know of course that lady de and lady anne were sisters consequently that she is aunt to the present mr no indeed i did not i knew nothing at all of lady s connections i never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday her daughter miss de e â l w r pride and prejudice fortune and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates this information made elizabeth smile as she thought of poor miss indeed must be all her tions vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself if he were already self destined to another mr said she speaks highly both of lady and her daughter but from some particulars that he has related of her i suspect his gratitude him and that in spite of her being his she is an conceited woman i believe her to be both in a great degree replied i have not seen her for many years but i â ery well remember that i never liked her and that her manners were and insolent she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever but i rather believe she part of her abilities from her rank and fortune part from her manner and the rest from the pride of her nephew who chooses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr s attentions there could be no conversation in the noise of mrs s supper party but his manners recommended him to every body whatever he said was said well and whatever he did done gracefully elizabeth went away with her head full of him she could think nothing but of mr and of what he had told her all the way home but there was not time for her even to mention bis name as they went for neither nor mr were once silent talked incessantly of tickets of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won and mr in describing the civility of mr and mrs protesting that he did not in the least regard bis losses at all the dishes at supper and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins had more to than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at house chapter xvii elizabeth related to jane the next day what had passed between mr and herself jane listened with astonishment and concern she knew not how to believe that mr could be so of mr s regard and yet it was not in her nature to question the of a young man of such amiable appearance as the possibility of his having really endured such was enough to interest all her tender feel and nothing therefore remained to be done but to think well of them both to defend the conduct of each and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained they have both said she been deceived i dare say in some way or other of which we can form no idea interested people have perhaps each to the other it is in short impossible for us to the causes or circumstances which may have them without actual blame on either side very true indeed and now my dear jane what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business bo clear them too or we shall be obliged to think iu of somebody as much as you choose but you not laugh me out of my opinion my dearest do but consider in what a light it places mr to be treating his father s favourite in such a manner â one 
7,whom his father had promised to provide for it is impossible no man of common humanity ne man who had any value for his character could be capable of it can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him oh no pride and prejudice i can much more easily believe mr s bein imposed on than that mr should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night names facts every thing mentioned without ceremony if it be not so let mr contradict it besides there was truth in his looks it is difficult indeed â it is distressing one does not know what to think i beg your pardon â one knows exactly what to think but jane could think with certainty on only one point â that mr if he had been imposed on would have much to suffer when the affair became public the two young ladies were summoned from the where this conversation passed by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking mr and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at which was fixed for the following tuesday the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again called it an age since they had met and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation to the rest of the family they paid little attention avoiding mrs as much as possible saying not much to elizabeth and nothing at all to the others they were soon gone rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs s the prospect of the ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family mrs chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from mr himself instead of a card jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends and the attentions of their brother and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in mr s look and behaviour the happiness anticipated by i d less on any single ox aw ax and prejudice for though they each like elizabeth meant to dance half the evening with mr he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them and a ball was at any rate a ball and even mary could assure her family that she had no for it i can have my mornings to myself said sl e it is enough i think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements society has claims on us and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of and amusement as desirable for every body elizabeth s spirits were so high on the occasion that though she did not often speak to mr col she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr s invitation and if he did whether he would think it proper to join in the evening s amusement and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head and was very far from a rebuke either from the or lady de by venturing to dance i am by no means of opinion i assure you said he that a ball of this kind given by a young man of to respectable people can have any evil tendency and i am so far from to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening and i take this op of yours miss elizabeth for the two first dances especially a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause and not to any for her elizabeth felt herself completely taken in she had proposed being engaged by for those very dances and to have mr instead â her had been never worse timed there was no help for it however mr s happiness and her own was delayed a little longer and mr s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could she was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it of something more it now first struck x selected from among her as the of par lis fi oi â a and form a table at in the absence of more eligible the idea soon reached to conviction as she observed his increasing towards herself and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to her elizabeth however did not choose to take the hint being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply mr might never make the and till he did it was useless to quarrel about him if there had not been a ball to prepare for and talk of the younger miss would have been in a pitiable state at this time for from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to once no aunt no officers no news could be sought after the very for were got by even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr and nothing less than a dance on tuesday could have made such a friday saturday sunday and monday to and chapter xviii till elizabeth entered the drawing room at and looked in vain for mr among the cluster 
7,of red coats there assembled a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not have alarmed her she had dressed with more than usual care and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained of his trusting that it was not m t v the course of the evening but ti e and dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr s pleasure in the invitation to the officers and this was not exactly the case the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend mr to whom eagerly applied and who told them that had been obliged to go to town on business the day before and was not yet returned adding with a smile â i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here this part of his intelligence though unheard by was caught by elizabeth and as it assured her that was not less for s absence than if her first had been just every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite which he directly afterwards approached to make attention forbearance patience with was injury to she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him and turned away with a degree of ill humour which she could not wholly even in speaking to mr whose blind partiality provoked her but elizabeth was not formed for ill humour and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening it could not dwell long on her spirits and having told all her to whom she had not seen for a week she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the of her cousin and to point him out to her particular notice the two first dances how ever brought a return of distress they were dances of mortification mr awkward and solemn instead of attending and often moving wrong without being aware of it gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give the moment of her release from him was ecstasy she danced next with an officer and had the refreshment of talking of and of hearing that he was universally liked when those dances were over she re pride and turned to and was in conversation with her when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand that without knowing what she did she accepted him he walked away again immediately and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind tried to console her i dare say you will find him very agreeable heaven forbid that would be the greatest mis fortune of all to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate do not wish me such an evil the dancing however and approached to claim her hand could not help her in a whisper not to be a and allow her fancy for to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence elizabeth made no answer and took her place in the set amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr and reading in her neighbours looks their equal amazement in beholding it they stood for some time without speaking a word and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances and at first was resolved not to break it till suddenly that it would be the greater punish ment to her partner to oblige him to talk she made some slight observation on the dance he replied and was again silent after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with â it is your turn to say something now mr talked about the dance and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room or the number of couples he smiled and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said very well that reply will do for the present perhaps by and by i may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones but now we may be silent do you talk by rule then while you are dancing sometimes one must speak a little you know it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of conversation pride and to b so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine both replied elizabeth for i have always seen a great in the turn of our minds we are each of an disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say something that will the whole room and be handed down to posterity with all the of a proverb this is no very striking resemblance of your own character i am sure said he how near it may be to i cannot pretend to say you think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly i must not decide on my own performance he made no answer and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to she answered in the affirmative and unable to resist the tempt added when you met us there the other day we had just been forming a new acquaintance the was immediate a deeper shade of his features but he said not a 
7,word and elizabeth though herself for her own weakness could not go on at length spoke and in a constrained manner said â mr is blessed with such happy manners as may his making friends whether he may be equally capable of retaining them is less certain he has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship replied elizabeth with emphasis and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life made no answer and seemed desirous of changing the subject at that moment sir william appeared close to them meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room but on perceiving mr he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner i have been most highly gratified indeed my dear sir such very superior dancing is not vi tâ wâ q pride prejudice evident that you belong to the circles allow mc to s y however that your fair partner not disgrace yon and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated especially when a certain desirable events my dear miss glancing at her sister and shall take place what congratulations will then flow in i i iq peal to mr â but let me not interrupt you sir you will not thank me for you from the converse of that young lady whose br ht eyes are also me the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by but sir william s allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards and jane who were dancing together recovering himself however shortly he turned to his partner and said â r william s interruption has made me forget what we were talking of i do not think we were speaking at all sir william not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves we have tried two or three subjects already without success and what we are to talk df next i cannot imagine what think you of books said he smiling books â ch no â i am sure we never read the same or not with the same feelings i am sorry you think so but if that be the ease there can at least be no want of we may compare our opinions no â i cannot talk of books in a ball my head is always full of something the present always you in such scenes â does it said he with a look of doubt yes always she replied without knowing what she said for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming i remember hearing you once say mr that you hardly ever forgave â that your resentment once created was you are very cautious i suppose as to its treated f pride and â am said he with a voice and never allow yourself to he hy prejudice i hope not it is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion to be secure of judging properly at first may i ask to what these questions tend merely to the illustration of character said she endeavouring to shake off her gravity i am trying to make it out and what is your success she shook her head i do not get on at all i hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly i can readily believe answered he gravely that reports may vary greatly with respect to me and i could wish miss that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either but if i do not take your likeness now i may never have another opportunity i by no means any pleasure of yours he coldly replied she said no more and they went down the other dance and parted in silence on each side dissatisfied though not to an equal degree for in s breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her which soon procured her pardon and directed all his anger against another they had not long separated when miss came towards her and with an expression of civil disdain thus her â so miss i hear you are quite delighted with george your sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a thousand questions and i find that the young man forgot to tell you among his other communications that he was the son of old the late mr s steward let me recommend you however as a friend not to give confidence to all his for as to mr s using him ill it is perfectly false for on the contrary he has been always re kind to him though george has treated mr in a most infamous manner i do not know q t pride and particulars but i know very well that mr is not in the least to blame that he cannot bear to hear mentioned and that though my brother thought he could not well ay â d including him in his invitation to the officers he was excessively glad to find that he liad taken himself out of the way his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing indeed and i wonder how he d presume to do it i pity you miss for this discovery of your favourite s guilt but really considering his descent one could not expect much better his guilt and his descent appear by your to be the same said elizabeth angrily for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr s steward and of that i can assure you he me himself i beg your pardon replied miss turning away with a sneer 
7,excuse my interference it was kindly meant insolent girl said elizabeth to herself you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr she then sought her eldest sister who had undertaken to make on the same subject of jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency a glow of such happy expression as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the of the evening elizabeth instantly read her feelings and at that moment solicitude for resentment against his enemies and every thing else gave way before the hope of jane s being in the fairest way for happiness i want to know said she with a countenance no less smiling than her sister s what you have learnt about mr but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person in which case you may be sure of my pardon no replied jane i have not forgotten him but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you mr does not know the whole of his history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr pride and s bat he will for the good conduct the and honour of his friend and is perfectly convinced that mr has deserved much less attention from mr than he has received and i am sorry to say that by his account as as his sister s mr is by no means a respectable young man i am afraid he has been very and has deserved to lose mr s regard mr not know mr himself no he never saw him till the other morning at this account then is what he has received from mr i am perfectly but what does he say of the he does not exactly recollect the circumstances though he heard them from mr more than once but he believes that it was left to him only i have not a doubt of mr s sincerity said â warmly but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only mr s defence of his friend was a very able one i dare say but since he is with several parts of the story and has learnt the rest from that friend himself i shall venture still to of both gentlemen as i did before she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each and on which there could be no difference of sen elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of s r ard and said all in her power to her confidence in it on their joined by mr himself withdrew to miss to whose after the of her last partner she had scarcely replied before mr came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery i have found out said he by a singular accident that there is now in the room a near relation of my pa i happened to the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of his house the names of his cousin miss de and g pride and tier lady how wonderfully these occur who would have thought of my h â perhaps â a nephew of lady d this i am most thankful that the made in time for me to pay my respects to him now going to do and trust he will excuse my done it before my total ignorance of the plead my apology i not going to introduce yourself to mr i am i shall entreat his pardon for not it earlier i believe him to he lady it will be in my power to assure him that ip was quite well yesterday se tried hard to him from such a scheme a that mr would consider his addressing introduction as an impertinent freedom rather to his aunt that it was not in the least should be any notice on either side and ere it must belong to mr the superior to b in the acquaintance mr her with the determined air of following his tion and when she ceased speaking ar miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion d of your excellent judgment in all matters of your understanding but permit me to say lust be a wide difference between the amongst the and those which for give me leave to observe that i office as equal in point of dignity with the in the kingdom â provided that a proper hu is at the same time maintained you ore allow me to follow the of my occasion which leads me to perform what a point of duty pardon me for your advice which on every other subject shall ant guide in the case before us i con more fitted by education and habitual study to hat is right than a young lady like yourself low bow he left her to attack mr whose b and prejudice reception of his advances she eagerly watched and whose astonishment at so addressed was very evident her his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it she felt as if hearing it all and saw in the motion of his lips the words apology and lady de it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man mr was him with wonder and when at last mr allowed him to speak replied with an air of distant civility mr however was not dis from speaking again and mr s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow and moved another way mr then returned to â i have no reason i assure you said 
8,he to be dissatisfied with my reception mr seemed much pleased with the attention he answered me with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of s discern ment as to be certain sue could never bestow a favour it was really a very handsome thought upon the whole i am pleased with him as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made her perhaps almost as happy as jane she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow and she felt capable under such circumstances of endeavouring even to like s two sisters her mother s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way and she determined not to venture near her lest she might hear too much when they sat down to supper therefore she considered it a most unlucky which placed them within one of each other and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person lady freely openly and of nothing else but of her expectation that jane would be soon married to mr it was an â x o s and prejudice and mrs seemed incapable of fatigue while the advantages of the match his being such a charming young man and so rich and living but three miles from them were the first points of self and it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane and to be certain that they must de the connection as much as she could do it was moreover such a promising thing for her younger daughters as marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men and lastly it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to her single daughters to the care of their sister that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure because on such occasions it is the etiquette but no one was less likely than mrs to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life she concluded with many good wishes that lady might soon be equally fortunate though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother s words or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper for to her vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was over heard by mr who sat opposite to them her mother only her for being what is mr to v vi should be afraid of him i am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing he may not like to hear for heaven s sake madam speak lower what advantage can it be to you to offend mr you will never recommend to his friend by so doing nothing that she could say however had any influence her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded for y e was x at her mother she was x y and fixed by her the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity at however mrs had no more to say and lady who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no of sharing was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken â now began to revive but not long was the interval of tranquillity for when supper was over singing was talked of and she had the mortification of seeing mary after very little entreaty preparing to oblige the company by many significant looks â and silent entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of â but in vain mary would not understand them such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her and she began her song elizabeth s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations and she watched her progress through the several with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close for mary on amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again after the pause of half a minute began another mary s powers were by no means fitted for such a display her voice was weak and her manner affected elizabeth was in agonies she looked at jane to see how she bore it but jane was very talking to she looked at his two sisters and saw them making signs of derision at each other and at who continued however grave she looked at her father to entreat his interference lest mary should be singing all night he took the hint and when mary had finished her second song said aloud â that will do extremely well child you have delighted us long enough let the other young ladies have time to exhibit mary though pretending not to hear was somewhat disconcerted and elizabeth sorry for her and sorry for her father s speech was afraid her anxiety had done no good others of the party were now applied to if i said mr were so ft â able to sing i should have great â w and prejudice obliging the company an air for i consider music as a very innocent diversion and perfectly with the profession of a i do not mean to assert 
8,that we can be justified in too much of our time to music for there are certainly other things to be attended to the of a parish has much to do in tlie first place he must make an agreement for as may be to himself and not to his patron he must write his own sermons and the time that remains will not be too for his duties and the care and improvement of his whidi he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible and i do not think it of li t importance that he should have attentive and manners towards every body especially towards those to whom he owes his i cannot him of that duty nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of his respect towards any body connected with the family and with a bow to mr he concluded his speech which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room many stared â many smiled but no one looked more amused than mr himself while his wife seriously commended mr for having spoken sensibly and observed in a half whisper to y that he was a remarkably clever good kind of young man to elizabeth it appeared that had her made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success and happy did she think it for and her that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed that his two sisters and mr however should have such an opportunity of her relations was enough and she not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman or the insolent smiles of the ladies were more intolerable the rest of the evening brought her little amusement she was by mr who continued most per by her side and though he could not with her to dance with him again it out of her power to dance with others in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody and offer to introduce him to any young in the room he assured her that as to dancing he was perfectly to it that his chief object was by attentions to recommend to and that he should therefore make a point of remain ing dose to her the whole evening there was no arguing upon such a project she owed her greatest to her friend miss who often them and good mr s to she was at least free the offence of mr s farther notice though often standing within a very short distance of her quite disengaged he came near enough to speak she felt it to he the probable of her allusions to mr and in it the party were the last of all the company to depart and by a of mrs had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an hour after every body was gone which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family mrs and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to com plain of fatigue and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves they every attempt of mrs at and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party which was very little â by the long speeches of mr who was mr and his sisters on tlie elegance of their entertainment and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests said nothing at all mr in equal silence was en the scene mr and jane were standing together a little detached from the rest and talked only to each other elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mrs or miss and even was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional ex of lord how tired i am accompanied by a violent when at length they arose to take leave mrs pride and prejudice was most civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at and addressed herself to mr to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time without the ceremony of a formal invitation was all grateful pleasure and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her after his return from london whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time mrs was perfectly satisfied and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that allowing for the necessary preparations of new carriages and wedding clothes she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at in the course of three or four months of having another daughter married to mr she thought with equal certainty and with considerable though not equal pleasure elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her the worth of each was by mr and chapter xix the next day opened a new scene at mr made his declaration in form having resolved to do it without loss of time as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday and having no feelings of to make it distressing to himself even at the mo ment he set about it in a very orderly manner with all the which he supposed a regular part of the business on finding mrs elizabeth and one of the younger girls together soon after breakfast he addressed the mother in these words â may i hope madam for your interest with your fair daughter elizabeth when i for the honour of a audience with her in the course of this morning and before elizabeth had time for any thing 
8,but a blush of surprise mrs instantly answered â oh dear yes certainly i am sure will be very happy â i am sure she can have no objection come i want you up stairs and gathering her work together she was hastening away when elizabeth called out â dear ma am do not go i beg you will not go mr must excuse me he can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear i am going away myself no no nonsense i desire you will stay where you are and upon elizabeth s seeming really with vexed and embarrassed looks about to escape she added i upon your staying and hearing mr elizabeth would not oppose such an and a moment s consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible she sat down again and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided be distress and diversion mrs and walked off and as soon as they were gone mr began â believe me my dear miss elizabeth that your modesty so far from doing you any dis service rather adds to your other you would have been less amiable in my eyes had not been this little but allow me to assure you that i have your re mother s permission for this address you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse however natural may lead you to my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken almost as soon as i entered the house i you out as the companion of my future life but before i am run away with by ray feelings on this subject perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying â and moreover for coming into with the design of selecting a wife as certainly did the idea of mr with all his solemn composure and prejudice being nm away with by his feelings made elizabeth so laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther and he continued â my reasons for marrying are that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish secondly that i am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness and which perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling twice has she condescended to give me her opinion too on this subject and it was but the very saturday night before i left â between our pools at while mrs was arranging miss de s â that she said mr you must marry a clergyman like you must marry choose properly choose a for my sake and for your let her be an active useful sort of person not brought up high but able to make a small income go a good way this is my advice find such a woman as soon as you can bring her to and i will visit her allow me by the way to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady de as among the least of the advantages in my power to oâ fer yon will find her manners beyond any thing i can describe and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony it remains to be told why my views were directed to instead of my own neighbourhood where i assure you there arc many amiable young women but the fact is that being as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father who however may live many years longer i could not satisfy myself wi out to choose a wife from among his daughters that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes place which however as i have already said may not be for several this has been my motive my fair cousin and prejudice â od i flatter it will not sink me in esteem and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection to fortune i am perfectly indifferent and shall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am well aware that it could not be complied with and that one thousand pounds in the per cents whidi will not be yours till after your mother s is all that you may ever be entitled to on that head therefore i shall be uniformly silent and you may assure yourself that no reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married it was absolutely necessary to interrupt bim now you are too hasty sir she cried you forget that i have made no answer let me do it without further loss of time accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them i am not now to learn replied mr with a formal wave of the hand that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept when he first applies for their favour and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said and all hope to lead you to the altar ere long upon my word sir cried elizabeth your hope is rather an extraordinary one 
8,after my declaration i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time i am perfectly serious in my refusal you could not make me happy and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who would make you so nay were your friend lady to know me i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation ct were it certain that lady would think so laid mr very gravely â but i cannot imagine pride and prejudice that her lady would at all of you and you may he certain that when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty economy and other amiable indeed mr all praise of me will be unnecessary you give leave to judge for myself and pay the compliment of believing what i say i wish you very happy and very rich and by refusing your hand do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise in the offer you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family and may take possession of estate whenever it falls without any self reproach this matter may be considered therefore as finally settled and rising as she thus spoke she would have quitted the room had not mr thus addressed her â when i do the honour of speaking to you next on the subject i shall hope to receive a favourable answer than you have now given though i far from you of cruelty at present because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character really mr cried elizabeth with some warmth you puzzle exceedingly if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one ou must give leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that your refusal of my addresses are merely words of course my reasons for believing it are briefly these â it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance or that the establishment i can offer be any other than highly desirable my situation in life my connections with the family of de and my relationship to your own are highly in favour and you should take it into further consideration that in spite of your attractions it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you pride and â oar i is unhappily so small that it will in all undo the of your loveliness and amiable as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your of me i shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense according to the usual practice of elegant females i do assure you sir that i have no pretensions whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in a respectable man i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals but to accept them is absolutely impossible my feelings in every respect forbid it can i speak do not consider me now as an el ant female intending to plague you but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart you are uniformly charming cried he with an air of awkward gallantry and i am persuaded that when by the express authority of both your excellent parents my proposals will not fail of being acceptable to such perseverance in wilful self deception elizabeth would make no reply and immediately and in silence withdrew determined that if he persisted in considering her repeated as flattering encouragement to apply to her father whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and of an elegant female chapter xx mr was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love for mrs having about in the to watch for the end of the conference no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase than she entered the breakfast room and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection pride and prejudice mr received and returned these with equal pleasure and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to he satisfied since the refusal which his cousin had given him would naturally flow from her modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character this information however startled mrs she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals but she dared not to and could not help saying so but depend upon it mr she added that shall be brought to reason i will speak to her about it myself directly she is a very foolish girl and does not know her own interest but i will make her know it pardon me for interrupting you madam cried mr but if she is really and foolish i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state if therefore she actually in my suit perhaps it were better not to force 
9,her into accepting me because if liable to such defects of temper she could not contribute much to my felicity sir you quite me said mrs alarmed is only in such matters as these in every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived i will go directly to mr and we shall very soon settle it with her i am sure she would not give him time to reply but hurrying instantly to her husband called out as she entered the library â oh mr you are wanted immediately we are all in an uproar you must come and make marry mr for she vows she will not have him and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her mr raised his eyes from his book as she entered and fixed them on her face with a calm which was not in the least altered by her communication i have not the pleasure of understanding you said te le when she had her speech of what an you f of mr and declares she will not have mr and mi begins to say that he will not have and what am i ta do cm the it a hopeless business speak to about it yourself tell her that you upon her marrying him let her be called down she shall hear my opinion mrs rang the bell and miss elizabeth was summoned to the library come here child cried her father aa she appeared i have sent for you on an affair of importance i under stand that mr has made you an of marriage is it elizabeth replied that it was very well â and this offer of marriage yon have refused very well we now come to the point your mother upon your accepting it is it not ao mrs i yea will never her again an unhappy is you elizabeth from this day you must be a to one of your parents your mother will never see you again if you do not marry mr and i will never see you again if you do elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning but mrs who had persuaded that her husband regarded the affair as she wished was excessively what do you mean mr by talking in this way you promised me to upon her marrying my dear replied her husband i have two sm to request first that you will allow me i use of my understanding on the present occasion aiid of my room i shall be glad to have the to myself as soon as may be not yet however in spite of her and prejudice husband did mrs up the point she talked to elizabeth again and again and threatened her by turns she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest but jane with all possible declined interfering and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks though her manner varied however her determination never did mr meanwhile was meditating in solitude on what had passed he thought too well of himself to com on what motive his cousin could refuse him and though his pride was hurt he in no other way his regard for her was quite imaginary and the possibility of her deserving her mother s reproach prevented his feeling any regret while the family were in this confusion came to spend the day with them she was met in the by who flying to her cried in a half whisper i am glad you are come for there is such fun here what do you think has happened this morning mr has made an offer to and she will not have him had hardly time to answer before they were joined by who came to tell the same news and no sooner had they entered the breakfast room where mrs was alone than she likewise began on the subject calling on miss for her compassion and her to persuade her friend to with the wishes of all her family pray do my dear miss she added in a melancholy tone for nobody is on my side nobody takes part with me i am cruelly used nobody feels for my poor nerves s reply was spared by the entrance of jane and elizabeth ay there she comes continued mrs looking as as may be and caring no more for us than if we were at york provided she can have her own way but i tell you what miss if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way you â never get a husband at all â and i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is and dead shall not be able to keep you â and so i warn y i have done with you from this very day told vou in the library you know that i should never speak to you again and you will find me as good as my word i have no pleasure in talking to children not that i have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body people who as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking nobody can tell what i but it is always so those who do not complain are never pitied her daughters listened in silence to this sensible that any attempt to reason with or soothe her would only increase the irritation she talked on therefore without interruption from any of them till they were joined by mr who entered with an air more stately than usual and on perceiving whom she said to the girls â now i do insist upon it that you all of you hold your tongues and let mr and me have a little conversation tc elizabeth 
9,passed quietly out of the room jane and followed but stood her ground determined to hear all she could and detained first by the civility of mr whose after herself and all her family were very minute and then by a little curiosity satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear in a voice mrs thus began the projected conversation â oh mr my dear madam replied he let us be for ever silent on this point far be it from me he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure to resent the behaviour of your daughter resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have be n in early and i trust i am resigned perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness my fair cousin honoured me with her hand for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation you will not i hope consider me as showing any to your family my dear b p prejudice madam by thus my pretensions to your daughter s favour without having paid yourself and mr the compliment of you to your authority in my behalf my conduct may i fear be in having accepted my from your ter s lips instead of your own but we are all liable to error i have certainly meant well through the whole affair my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself with due consideration for the advantage of all your family and if my manner has been at all i here beg leave to chapter xxi the discussion of mr s offer was now nearly at an end and elizabeth had only to suffer from the able feelings necessarily attending it and occasionally from some allusion of her mother as for the gentleman himself his feelings were chiefly expressed not by embarrassment or or by trying to avoid her but by of manner and silence he scarcely ever spoke to her and the attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to miss whose civility in listening to him was a relief to them all and especially to her friend the morrow produced no of mrs s ill humour or ill health mr was also in the same state of angry pride elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might his visit but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it he was to have gone on saturday and to saturday he still meant to stay after breakfast the girls walked to â to if mr were returned and to lament over his absence from the ball he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt s where his regret and vexation and the concern of every body were pride and prejudice well talked over to elizabeth however he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been self imposed i found said he as the time drew near that had better not meet mr â that to be in the same room the same party with him for so many hours together might be more than i could bear and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself she highly approved his forbearance and they had leisure for a full discussion of it and for all the which they bestowed on each other as and another officer walked back with them to and during the walk he particularly attended to her his accompanying them was a double advantage she felt all the compliment it offered to herself and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother soon after their return a letter was delivered to miss it came from and was opened immediately the envelope contained a sheet of elegant little hot pressed paper well covered with a lady s fair flowing hand and elizabeth saw her sister s countenance change as she read it and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages jane recollected herself soon and putting the letter away tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs when they had gained their own room jane taking out her letter said this is from what it contains has surprised me a good deal the whole party have left by this time and are on their way to town and without any intention of coming back again you shall hear what she says she then read the first sentence aloud which the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly and of their meaning to dine that day in street where mr had a house the next was in these words â â i do not pretend to b pride and regret any thing i shall leave in except your society my dearest friend but we wiu hope at some future period to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we have known and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most correspondence i depend on you for that to these high flown expressions elizabeth listened with all the of distrust and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her she saw nothing in it really to lament it was not to be supposed that their absence from would prevent mr s being there and as to the loss of their society she was persuaded that jane must soon cease to regard it in the of 
9,his it is unlucky said she after a short pause that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters mr will not be detained in london by them decidedly says that none of the party will return into this winter i will read it to you my brother left us yesterday he imagined that the business which took him to london might be concluded in three or four days but as we are certain it cannot be so and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again we have determined on following him thither that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a hotel many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter i wish i could hear that you my dearest friend had any intention of making one in the crowd but of that i despair i sincerely hope your christmas in may abound in the which that season generally brings and that your will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the of whom we shall deprive vou it is evident by this added jane that he comes back no more this winter pride and it is only evident that miss does not mean he why will you think so it must be his own doing he is his own master but you do not know all i read you the passage which particularly hurts me i will have no from you mr is impatient to see his sister and to confess the truth we are scarcely less eager to meet her again i really do not think has her equal for beauty elegance and accomplish ments and the affection she in and myself is heightened into something still more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject but i will not leave the country without confiding them and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable my brother her greatly already he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing her relations all wish the connection as much as his own and a sister s partiality is not me i think when i call charles most capable of engaging any woman s heart with all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it am i wrong my dearest jane in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many what think you of this sentence my dear said jane as she finished it is it not clear enough does it not expressly declare that neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister that she is perfectly convinced of her brother s indifference and that if she the nature of my feelings for him she means most kindly to put me on my guard can there be any other opinion on the subject yes there can for mine is totally different will you hear it most willingly you shall have it in a few words miss sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him to marry miss she follows him to to n in the hope of keeping him there and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you pride prejudice jane shook her head indeed jane you ought to me no one who has ever seen you together can his affection miss i am sure cannot she is not such a could she have seen half as much love in mr for herself she would have ordered her wedding clothes but the case is this â we are not rich enough or grand enough for them and she is the more anxious to get miss for her brother from the notion that when there has been one she may have less trouble in a second in which there is certainly some ingenuity and i dare say it would succeed if miss de were out of the way but my dearest jane you cannot seriously imagine that because miss tells you her brother greatly miss he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you he is very much in love with her friend if we thought alike of miss replied jane your representation of all this might make me quite easy but i know the foundation is is incapable of deceiving any one and all that i can hope in this case is that she is deceived herself that is right you could not have started a more happy idea since you will not take comfort in mine believe her to be deceived by all means you have now done your duty by her and must fret no longer but my dear sister can i be happy even supposing the best in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere you must decide for yourself said elizabeth and if upon mature deliberation you find that the misery of his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife i advise you by all means to refuse him how can you talk so said jane faintly smiling you must know that though i should be exceedingly grieved at their i could not hesitate pride and prejudice i lid not think you would and that being the 
9,case cannot consider your situation with much compassion but if he returns no more this winter my choice will never be required a thousand things may arise in six months the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt it appeared to her merely the suggestion of s interested wishes and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes however openly or spoken could influence a young man so totally independent of every one she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect jane s temper was not and she was gradually led to hope though the of affection sometimes overcame the hope that would return to and answer every wish of her heart they agreed that mrs should only hear of the departure of the family without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman s conduct but even this partial gave her a great deal of concern and she it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as tbey were all getting so intimate together after it however at some length she had the consolation of thinking that mr would be soon down again and soon dining at and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that though be had been invited only to a family dinner she would take care to have two full courses chapter xxii the were engaged to dine with the and again during the chief of the day was miss so kind as to listen to mr elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her it keeps him in good humour said ihe and i am more obliged to you than i can express pride and prejudice assured her of her satisfaction in being useful and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time this was very amiable but s kindness extended farther than â had any conception of â its object was nothing less than to secure her from any return of mr s addresses by engaging them towards herself such was miss s scheme and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave so very soon but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character for it led him to escape out of house the next morning with admirable and hasten to lodge to throw himself at her feet he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins from a conviction that if they saw him depart they could not fail to conjecture his design and he was not to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise for though feeling almost secure and with reason for had been to encouraging he was comparatively since the adventure of wednesday his reception however was of the most flattering kind miss perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there in as short a time as mr s long speeches would allow every thing was settled between them to the of both and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men and though such a must be waved for the present the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance and miss who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment cared not how soon that establishment were gained sir william and lady were speedily applied to for their consent and it was bestowed with a most joyful and prejudice alacrity mr s present made it a most match for their daughter to whom they could ve little fortune and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair lady began directly to calculate more interest than the matter had ever excited before many years longer mr was likely to live and sir william gave it as his decided opinion that whenever mr should be in possession of the estate it i ould be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st james s the whole family in short were properly on the occasion the younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of s dying an old maid herself was tolerably composed she had gained her point and had time to consider of it her reflections were in general satisfactory mr to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable his society was irksome and his attachment to her must be imaginary but still he would be her husband without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony marriage had always been her object it was the only honourable provision for well educated young women of small fortune and however uncertain of giving happiness must be their from want this she had now and at the age of twenty seven without having ever been handsome she felt all the good luck of it least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person elizabeth would wonder and probably would blame her and though her resolution was not to be shaken her feelings must be hurt by such a she resolved to ve her the information herself and therefore charged mr when he to to dinner to drop no hint of what had passed before any of 
10,the family a promise of secrecy was of course very given but it could not be kept without difficulty for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ing to pride and he was at the same time great self denial for he was longing to publish his prosperous love as he was to begin his journey too early on the row to see any of the family the ceremony of leave taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night an mrs with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at again whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them my dear madam he replied this invitation is par gratifying because it is what i have been hoping to receive and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible they were all astonished and mr who could no means wish for so speedy a return immediately said â but is there not danger of lady s here my good sir you had better n your relations than run the risk of offending your my dear sir replied mr i am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her s you cannot be too much on your guard risk any thing rather than her displeasure and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again which i should think exceedingly probable stay quietly at home and be satisfied that we shall take no believe me my dear sir my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention and depend upon it you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in as for my fair cousins though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness not excepting my cousin â with proper the ladies then withdrew all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return mrs wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger and prejudice ill girls and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him she his abilities much higher than any of the others there was a in his reflections which often struck her and though by no means so clever as herself she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers he might become a very agreeable companion but on the following morning every hope of this kind was done away miss called soon after breakfast and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before the possibility of mr s himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two but that could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum and she could not help crying out â engaged to mr my dear impossible the steady countenance which miss had commanded in telling her story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach though ss it was no more than she expected she soon regained her composure and calmly replied â why should you be surprised my dear do you think it incredible that mr should be able to procure any woman s good opinion because he was not so happy as to succeed with you but elizabeth had now recollected herself and making a strong effort for it was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her and she wished her all imaginable happiness i see what you are feeling replied you must be surprised very much surprised so lately as mr was wishing to marry you but when you have had time to think it all over i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done i am not romantic you know i never was i ask only a comfortable home and consider and ing mr s character connections and situation ij life i am that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can on entering the marriage state â quietly answered undoubtedly and after an awkward pause they returned to the rest of the family did not stay much longer and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so a match the strangeness of mr s making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted she had always felt that s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage the of mr was a most humiliating ture and to the pang of a friend herself and sunk in her esteem was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be ly happy in the lot she had chosen chapter elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters reflecting on what she had heard and doubting whether she was to mention it when sir william himself appeared sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family with many compliments to them and much self on the prospect of a connection between the houses he unfolded the matter â to an audience not merely wondering but incredulous for mrs with 
10,more perseverance than politeness protested he must be entirely mistaken and always and often exclaimed â good lord sir william how can you tell such a c and i story do not you know that mr wants marry nothing less than the of a borne without anger such treatment hut sir good breeding carried him through it au and though begged leave to he positive as to the truth of his he to all their impertinence with the mc courtesy â feeling it on her to relieve hi from so unpleasant a situation now put herself forward confirm his account by mentioning her prior of it from herself and endeavoured to put stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william she was readily joined by jane and by making variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expect from the match the excellent character of mr and the convenient distance of from london mrs was in fact too much overpowered to say great deal while sir william remained but no sooner hi be left them than her feelings found a rapid vent in t first place she persisted in the whole of tl matter secondly she was very sure that mr h been taken in she trusted that they would ne be happy together and that the match might broken off two however were plainly from the whole one that elizabeth was the real cause all the mischief and the other that she herself had be used by them all and on these two points s principally dwelt during the rest of the day could console and nothing her nor did that di wear out her resentment a week elapsed before she see elizabeth without scolding her a month passed before she could speak to sir william or lady without being rude and many months were gone she could at all forgive their daughter mr emotions were much more tranquil on tl occasion and such as he did experience he pronounced be of a most agreeable sort for it gratified him he to discover that whom he had been x and to think tolerably sensible was as foolish as his wife and more foolish than his daughter jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable and were far from miss for mr was only a clergyman and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at lady could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mrs the comfort of having a daughter well married and she called at rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was though mrs sour looks and ill natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away between elizabeth and there was a restraint which kept them silent on the subject and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever between them again her disappointment in made her turn with regard to her sister of whose and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious as had now been gone a week and nothing was heard of his return jane had sent an early answer to her letter and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again the promised letter of thanks from mr arrived on tuesday addressed to their father and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelve month s abode in the family might have prompted after his conscience on that head he proceeds to inform them with many expressions of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour miss and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight for lady he added so heartily approved his marriage that she wished it to take place aa soon as possible which he trusted would be an k with his amiable to name an early day for making him the happiest of men mr s return into was no longer a matter of pleasure to mrs on the contrary she as much disposed to complain of it as her husband it was very strange that he should come to instead of to lodge it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome she hated having in the house while her health was so indifferent and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable such were the gentle murmurs of mrs and they gave way only to the greater distress of mr s continued absence neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in of his coming no more to the whole winter a report which highly mrs and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood even elizabeth began to fear â not that was indifferent â but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of jane s happiness and so to the of her lover she could not prevent its frequently the united efforts of his two sisters and of his overpowering friend assisted by the attractions of miss and the amusements of london might be too much she feared for the strength of his attachment as for jane her anxiety under this suspense was of course more painful than elizabeth s but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing and between herself and elizabeth therefore the subject was never alluded to but as no 
10,such delicacy restrained her mother an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of express her impatience for his arrival or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back she should think herself very ill used it needed all jane s steady to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity mr returned most on xi v i pride and prejudice fortnight but his reception at was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction he was too happy however to need much attention and luckily for the others the business of love making relieved them from a great deal of his company the chief of every day was spent by him at lodge and he sometimes returned to only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed mrs was really in a most pitiable state the very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of the sight of miss was odious to her as her successor in that house she regarded her with jealous whenever came to see them she concluded her to be the hour of possession and whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr was convinced that they were talking of the estate and to turn herself and her daughters out of the house as soon as mr was dead she complained bitterly of all this to her husband indeed mr said she it is very hard to think that should ever be mistress of this house that should be forced to make way for her and live to see her take my place in it my dear do not give way to such gloomy thoughts let us hope for better things let us flatter ourselves that may be the this was not very to mrs and fore instead of making any answer she went on as before i cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate if it was not for the i should not mind it what should not you mind i not mind any thing at all let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such i never can be thankful mr for any thing about the how any one could have the conscience to away an estate from one s own daughters i cannot understand and all for the sake of mr too should he have it more than any body else j leave it to yourself to w mix ft v pride and chapter xxiv miss s letter arrived and put an end to doubt the very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their a ng all settled in london for the winter and concluded with her brother s regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in before he left the country hope was over entirely over and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter found little except the professed affection of the writer that could give her any comfort miss s praise occupied the chief of it her many attractions were again dwelt on and boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy and ventured to the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter she wrote also with great pleasure of her brother s being an of mr s house and mentioned with some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture elizabeth to whom jane very soon the chief of all this heard it in silent indignation her heart was divided between concern for her sister and resentment against all others to s assertion of her brother s being partial to miss she paid no credit that he was really fond of jane she doubted no more than she had ever done and much as she had always been disposed to like him she could not think without anger hardly without contempt on that of temper that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his friends and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations had his own happiness however been the only sacrifice he might have been allowed to sport with it in whatever manner he thought best but her sister s was involved in it as she thought he must be sensible himself it was a subject in short on which reflection would be long indulged and must be she could think of nothing else and yet whether s regard had really died away or were i suppressed by his friend s interference whether he had been aware of jane s attachment or whether it had escaped his observation whatever were the case though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the differ ence her sister s situation remained the same her peace equally wounded a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth but at last on mrs s leaving them together after a longer irritation than usual about and its master she could not help saying â oh that my dear mother had more command over herself she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual on him but i will not it cannot last long he will be forgot and we shall all be as we were before elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude but said nothing you doubt me cried jane slightly colouring indeed you have no reason he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance but that is all i have nothing either to hope or fear and nothing to reproach him with thank i have not that pain a little time therefore â i shall certainly try to get the better with a stronger voice 
10,she soon added have this comfort immediately that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side and that it has done no harm to any one but myself my dear jane exclaimed elizabeth you are too good your sweetness and are really i do not know what to say to you i feel as if had never done you justice or loved you as you serve miss eagerly all extraordinary merit and threw back the praise on her sister s warm affection nay said elizabeth this is not fair you wish to think all the world respectable and are hurt if i speak ill of any body only want to think you perfect and you set yourself against it bo not be afraid of my running into and any excess of my on your privilege of universal good will you need not there are few people whom i really love and still fewer of whom i think well the more i see of the world the more am i dissatisfied with it and every day my of the of all human characters and of the little dependence that can he placed on the appearance of either merit or sense i have met with two instances lately one i will not mention the other is s marriage it is unaccountable in every view it is unaccountable my dear do not give way to such feelings as these they will ruin your happiness you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper consider mr s and s prudent steady character remember that she is one of a large family that as to fortune it is a most eligible match and be ready to believe for every body s sake that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin to you i would try to believe almost any thing but no one else could be by such a belief as this for were i persuaded that had any regard for him i should only think worse of her understand ing than i now do of her heart my dear jane mr is a conceited narrow minded silly man you know he is as well as i do and you must fee as well as i do that the woman who him cannot have a proper way of thinking you shall not defend her though it is you shall not for the sake of one individual change the meaning of principle and integrity nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me that selfishness is prudence and of danger security for happiness i must think your language too strong in speaking of both replied jane and i hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together but enough of this you alluded to something you mentioned two instances i cannot you but i entreat you dear not to pain me by thinking that person to blame and saying your opinion of him is sunk we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves injured i we not expect a j man to be always to guarded and it ia very nothing our own that ns women fancy more than it does and men take care that they â if it is done they cannot be justified but i haye no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine i am far from any part of mr s conduct to design said elizabeth but without to do wrong or to make others unhappy there may be error and there may be misery want of attention to other people s feelings and want of resolution will do the business and do you it to either of those yes to the last but if i go on i shall you by saying what i think of persons you esteem stop whilst you can you persist then in supposing his sisters influence him in with his friend i cannot believe it why should they try to influence him they can only wish his happiness and if he is attached to me no other woman can secure it your first position is false they may wish many things besides his happiness they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money great connections and pride beyond a doubt they do wish him to choose miss replied jane but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing they have known her much longer than they have known me no wonder if they love her better but whatever may be their own wishes it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brother s what sister think herself at liberty to do it unless there were something very objectionable if they believed him attached to me they would not try to part us if he were so they could not succeed by supposing such an you make every body acting and pride and prejudice wrongs and me most do not distress me by the idea i am not ashamed of having been mistaken â or at it is it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters let me take it in the best lights in the light in which it may be understood â not oppose such a wish and from this time mr s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them mrs still continued to wonder and at his returning no more and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient which ceased when he saw her no more but 
11,though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time she had the same story to repeat every day mrs s best comfort was that mr must be down again in the summer mr treated the matter differently so said he one day your sister is crossed in love i find i congratulate her next to being married a girl likes tc be crossed in love a little now and then it is something to think of and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions when is your turn to come you will hardly bear to be long by jane now is your time here are officers enough at to disappoint all the young ladies in the country let be your man he is a pleasant fellow and would you thank you sir but a less agreeable man would satisfy me we must not all expect jane s good fortune true said mr but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befall you you have an affectionate mother who will always make uie most of it mr s society was of material service in the gloom which the late perverse had thrown on many of the family they saw s pride and prejudice him often and to his other was now added that of general the whole of what elizabeth had already heard his claims on mr and all that he had suffered from him was now openly acknowledged and publicly and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked mr before they had known any thing of the matter miss was the only creature who could suppose there might be any circumstances in the case unknown to the society of her mild and steady always pleaded for and urged the of mistakes but by every body else mr was condemned as the worst of men chapter xxv after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity mr was called from his amiable by the arrival of saturday the pain of separation ever might be on his side by preparations for the reception of his bride as he had reason to hope that shortly after his next return into the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men he took leave of his relations at with as much solemnity as before wished his fair cousins health and happiness again and promised their father another letter of thanks on the following monday mrs had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife who came as usual to spend the christmas at mr was a sensible man greatly superior to his sister as well by nature as education the ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade and within view of his own could have been so well bred and agreeable mrs who was several years younger than mrs and mrs was an amiable intelligent elegant woman and pride and prejudice t great favourite with all her between the two eldest and herself especially there a very particular regard they had frequently been staying with her in town the first part of mrs s business on her ar rival was to her presents and describe the fashions when this was done she had a less active part to play it became her turn to listen mrs had many to relate and much to complain of they had all been very ill used since she last saw her sister two of her girls had been on the point of marriage and after all there was nothing in it i do not blame jane she continued for jane would have got mr if she could but oh sister it is very hard to think that she might have been mr wife by this time had not it been for her own he made her an offer in this very room and she refused him the consequence of it is that lady will have a daughter married before i have and that estate is just as much as ever the are very artful people indeed sister they are all for what they can get i am sorry to say it of them but so it is it makes me very nervous and poorly to be so in my own family and to have neighbours who think of themselves before any body else however your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts and i am very glad to hear what you tell us of long mrs to whom the chief of this news had been given before in the course of jane and elizabeth s correspondence with her made her sister a slight answer and in compassion to her turned the conversation when alone with elizabeth afterwards die spoke more on the subject mt seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane said she am sorry it went off but these things happen so often a young man such as you describe mr so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks and when accident them so easily forgets her that these sort of are very frequent pride and an excellent consolation in its way said elizabeth but it will not do for us we do not suffer by accident it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before but that expression of violently in love is so so doubtful so indefinite tha it gives me very little idea it is as often applied to feelings which arise only from a half hour s acquaintance as to a real strong attachment pray how violent was mr s love i never saw a more promising inclination he was growing quite to other people 
11,and wholly engrossed by her every time they met it was more de and remarkable at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance and i spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer could there be finer symptoms is not general the very essence of love oh yes of that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt poor jane i am sorry for her because with her disposition she may not get over it immediately it had better have happened to you you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner but do you think she would be prevailed on to go back witli us change of scene might be of service â and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as any thing elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal and felt persuaded of her sister s ready acquiescence i hope added mrs that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her we live in so different a part of town all our connections are so different and as you well know we go out so little that it is very improbable they should meet at all unless he really comes to see her and that is quite impossible for he is now in the of his friend and mr would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london my dear aunt how could you think of it mr may perhaps have heard of such a place as street but pride and prejudice be hardly think a month s enough to him from its were he once to ter it and depend upon it mr never without him so much the better i hope they will not meet at all but does not jane correspond with his sister will not be me to help calling she will drop the acquaintance entirely but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point as well as the still more interesting one of s being withheld from seeing jane she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her on that she did not consider it entirely hopeless it was possible and sometimes she thought it probable that his affection might be re animated and the influence of his friends successfully by the more natural influence of jane s attractions miss accepted her aunt s invitation with sure and the s were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time than as she hoped by s not in the same house with her brother she might occasionally spend a morning with her without any danger of seeing him the staid a week at and what with the the and the officers there was not a day without its engagement mrs had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister that they did not once sit down to a family dinner when the engagement was for home some of the officers always made part of it of which officers mr was sure to be one and on these occasions mrs rendered suspicious by elizabeth s warm of him narrowly observed them both without supposing them from what she saw to be very seriously in love their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left and represent to her the of encouraging such an attachment to mrs had one means of affording pleasure with his general powers about ten or a dozen years ago before her marriage she had spent a â considerable time in that very part of to which he belonged they had therefore many acquaintance in common and though had been little there since the death of s father years before it was yet in his power to give her intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of mrs had seen and known the late mr by character perfectly well here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse in comparing her recollection of with the minute description which could give and in her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor she was de lighting both him and herself on being made acquainted with the present mr s treatment of him she tried to remember something of that gentleman s disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it and was confident at last that she recollected having heard mr formerly spoken of as a very proud ill natured boy chapter xxvi mrs s caution to elizabeth was and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone after honestly telling her what she she thus went on â you are too sensible a girl to fall in love merely because you are warned against it and therefore i am not afraid of speaking openly seriously i would have you be on your guard do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very i have nothing to say against him he is a most interesting young man and if he had the fortune he ought to have i should think you could not do better but as it is â you must not let your fancy run away with you you have sense and we all expect you to use it your father would depend on am i ur and good conduct i am yoa disappoint your father my dear aunt this is being serious indeed yes and i hope to engage you to be serious likewise well then you need not be under any alarm i will take care of and of mr too lie shall not be in with me if i can prevent it elizabeth you are not serious now i beg your pardon 
11,i will try again at present i am not in love with mr no i certainly am not but he is beyond all comparison the most agreeable man i saw â and if he becomes really attached to me â i believe it will be better that he should not i see the of it oh that abominable mr my father s opinion of me does me the greatest honour and i should be miserable to it my father however is partial to mr in short my dear aunt i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy but since we see every day that where there is affection young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if i am tempted or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist all that i can promise you therefore is not to be in a i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object when i am in company with him i will not be wishing in short i will do my best perhaps it will be as well if you his com ing here so very often at least you should not remind your mother of inviting him as i did the other day said elizabeth with a con smile very true it will be wise in me to refrain from that but do not imagine that he is always here so often it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week you know my mother s ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends but really upon my honour i will try to do what i think to be wisest and now i hope you are satisfied her aunt assured her that she y aa ei i e and prejudice having thanked her for the kindness of her hints thej parted â a wonderful instance of given on such a point without being resented mr returned into soon after it had been quitted by the and jane but as he took up his abode with the his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs his marriage was now fast approaching and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable and even repeatedly to say in an tone that e wished they might be happy thursday was to be the wedding day and on wednesday miss paid her farewell visit and when she rose to take leave elizabeth ashamed of her mother s and reluctant good wishes and sincerely affected herself accompanied her out of the room as they went down stairs together said â i shall depend on hearing from you very often â that you certainly shall and have another favour to ask will you come and see me we shall often meet i hope in i am not to leave for some time promise me therefore to come to elizabeth could not refuse though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit my father and maria are to come to me in march added and i hope you will consent to be of the party indeed you will be as welcome to me as either of them the wedding took place the bride and bridegroom set off for from the church door and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual elizabeth soon heard from her friend and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it ever had been that it should be equally was impossible elizabeth could never address her without that all the comfort of intimacy was over and though determined not to as a correspondent it was for the sake of what had been rather than what was s first letters were with a good deal of eagerness there could not but and â be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home how she would like lady and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to he though when the letters were read felt that expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen she wrote cheerfully seemed surrounded with comforts and mentioned nothing which she could not praise the house furniture neighbourhood and roads were all to her taste and lady s behaviour was most friendly and obliging it was mr s picture of and softened and elizabeth perceived that â he must wait for her own visit there to know the rest jane had already written a few lines to h r sister to announce their safe arrival in london and when she wrote again elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the her impatience for this second letter was as well r as impatience generally is jane had been a week in town without either seeing or hearing from she accounted for it however by supposing that her last letter to her friend from had by some accident been lost my aunt she continued is going to morrow into that part of the town and i shall take the opportunity of calling in street she wrote again when the visit was paid and she had seen miss i did not think in spirits were her words but she was very glad to see me and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london i was right therefore my last letter had never her i after brother of course he was but so much engaged with mr that they scarcely ever saw him i found that miss was expected to dinner i wish i could see her my visit i as long as and mrs were going out i dare say i shall soon see them here elizabeth shook her head 
11,over this letter it convinced her that accident only could discover to mr her s being in town four weeks passed away and jane ng of him i iso i ride and l she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did hot re it hut she could no longer he to miss s after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight and every evening a fresh excuse for her the did at last appear but the of her stay and yet more the alteration of her manner allow jane to deceive herself no longer the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt my dearest will i am sure be incapable of in her better judgment at my expense when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss s regard for me but my dear sister though the event has proved you right do not think me obstinate if i still assert that considering what her behaviour was my confidence was as natural as your suspicion i do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me but if the same circumstances were to happen again i cm sure i should be deceived again did not return my visit till yesterday and not a note not a line did i receive in the mean time when she did come it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it she made a slight formal apology for not calling before said not a word of wishing to see me again and was in every respect s altered a creature that when she went away i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer i pity though i cannot help her she was very wrong in me out as she did i can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side but i pity her because she must feel that she has been acting wrong and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it i need not explain myself farther and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless yet if she feels it it will easily account for her behaviour to me and so dear as he is to his sister whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf is natural and amiable i cannot but wonder however at her having any such fears now because if he had at all cared about me we must liave met long long ago he knows of my being in and prejudice town i am certain from something she said herself and yet it would seem by her manner of talking as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss i cannot understand it if i were not afraid of judging harshly i should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of in all this but i wiu endeavour to banish every painful thought and think only of what will make me happy your affection and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt let me hear from you very soon miss said something of his never returning to again of giving up the house but not with any certainty we had better not mention it i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at pray go to see them with sir william and maria i am sure you will be very comfortable there yours c this letter gave elizabeth some pain but her spirits returned as she considered that jane would no longer be by the sister at least all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over she would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions his character sunk on every review of it and as a punishment for him as well as a possible advantage to jane she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr s sister as by s account she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away mrs about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman and required information and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself his apparent partiality had subsided his attentions were over he was the admirer of some one else elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all but she could see it and of it without material pain her heart had been but slightly touched and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice had fortune it the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he and eâ was now rendering himself agreeable but elizabeth dear sighted perhaps in this case than in s did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence no things on the contrary could be more natural and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to her she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both and could very sincerely wish him happy all this was acknowledged to mrs and after relating the circumstances she thus went on â i am now convinced my dear aunt that i have never been much in love for had i really experienced that pure and passion i should at present his very name and wish him all manner of evil but my feelings are not only cordial towards him they are even towards miss king i cannot find out that i hate her at all or that i am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl there can be no love in all this my has been effectual and though i should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance were i in love with him i cannot say 
12,that i regret my comparative importance may some times be purchased too dearly and take his much more to heart than i do they are young in the ways of the worlds and not yet open to the conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain chapter with no greater events than these in the family and otherwise by little beyond the walks to sometimes dirty and sometimes cold did and february pass away march was to take elizabeth to she had not at first thought very seriously of going thither but she soon was depending on the plan and she gradually learned to it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty had increased her desire of seeing again and weakened her disgust of mr there novelty in the scheme and as with such a mother and such sisters home could not be a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake the journey would moreover give her a peep at jane and in short as the time drew near she would have been yery sorry for any delay every thing however went on smoothly and was finally settled according to s first sketch she was to accompany sir ham and his second daughter the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time and the plan became perfect as plan could be the only pain was in leaving her father who would certainly miss her and who when it came to the point so little liked her going that he told her to write to him and almost promised to answer her letter the farewell between herself and mr was perfectly friendly on his side even more his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention the first to listen and to pity the first to be admired and in his manner of bidding her adieu wishing her every enjoyment reminding her of what she was to expect in lady de and trusting their opinion of her â their on of every body â would always there was a solicitude an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard and she parted from him convinced that whether married or single he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing her fellow the next day were not of a kind as make her think him less agreeable sir william and his daughter a good humoured girl but as empty headed as himself had nothing to say that could be worth hearing and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise elizabeth loved but she had known sir william s too long he could teu her nothing new of the wonders of his and and his were worn out like his information k l pride and prejudice it was a journey of only twenty four miles they began it so early as to be in street by noon as they drove to mr s door jane was at a drawing room window watching their arrival when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them and elizabeth looking earnestly in her face was pleased to see it and lovely as ever on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls whose eagerness for their cousin s appearance would not allow them to wait in the and whose as they had not seen her for a prevented their coming lower all was joy and kindness the day passed most pleasantly away the morning in bustle and and the evening at one of the theatres elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt their first subject was her sister and she was more grieved than astonished to hear in reply to her minute that though jane always struggled to support her spirits there were periods of it was reasonable however to hope that they would not continue long mrs gave her the particulars also of miss s visit in street and repeated conversations at different times between jane and herself which proved that the former had from her heart given up the acquaintance mrs then rallied her niece on s desertion and her on bearing it so well but my dear elizabeth she added what sort of girl is miss king i should be sorry to think our friend pray my dear aunt what is the difference in matrimonial affairs between the and the prudent motive where does discretion end and begin last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me because it would be and now because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds you want to find out that he is if you will only tell me what sort of girl miss king is shall know what to think she is a very good kind of girl i believe i know no harm of her pride and but he paid her not the smallest attention till grandfather s death made her mistress of tliis fortune no â why should he if it were not for him to gain my affections because i had no money what sion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about and who was equally poor but there seems in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event a man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant which other people may observe if she does not object to it why should we her not does not justify him it only shows her being deficient in something herself â sense or feeling well cried elizabeth have it as you choose he shall be and she shall be foolish no that is what i do not choose i should be sorry you know to think ill of a young 
12,man who has lived so long in oh if that is all i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in and their intimate friends who live in are not much better i am sick of them all thank heaven i am going tomorrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him stupid men are the only ones worth knowing after all take care that speech strongly of disappointment before they were separated by the conclusion of the play she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer we have not quite determined how far it shall carry us said mrs but perhaps to the lakes no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful my dear dear aunt she cried â what delight what felicity you give me fresh life and vigour adieu to disappointment and what are men to rocks and mountains oh what hours of k and transport we shall spend and when we do return it shall not be like other travellers being to give one accurate idea of any thing we wiu know where we have we recollect what we have seen lakes mountains and rivers shall not be together in our nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene will we begin about its relative situation let mr first be less those of the of travellers chapter â vâ r object in the next day s journey was new and interesting to elizabeth and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her healthy and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight they left the high road for the lane to every eye was in search of the and every turning expected to bring it in view the of park was their boundary on one side elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants at length the was the garden sloping to the road the house standing in it the green and tlie laurel hedge every thing declared they were arriving mr and appeared at the door and the carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house amidst the and smiles of the whole party in a moment they were all out of the chaise rejoicing at the sight of each other mrs welcomed her friend the pleasure and was more and more satisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately received she saw instantly that her cousin s manners were not altered by his mar his formal civility was just what it had been and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his after all her family they were then with no other delay than his out the of the entrance taken into the house and as soon as they were in the parlour he welcomed them a second time with formality to his and repeated all his wife s offers of refreshment elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory and she could not help that in displaying the good proportion of the room its aspect and its furniture he addressed himself particularly to her as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him but though every thing seemed neat and comfortable she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance and father looked with wonder at her friend she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion when mr said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed which certainly was not she involuntarily turned her eye on once or twice she could discern a faint blush but in general wisely did not hear after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room from the to the to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london mr invited them to take a stroll in the garden which was large and well laid out and to the cultivation of which he attended him self to work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which talked of the of the exercise and owned she encouraged it as much as possible here leading the way through every walk and cross walk and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for every view was pointed out with a which left beauty entirely behind he could number the fields in every direction and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant but of all the views which his garden or which the country or the kingdom could boast none were to be compared with the prospect of afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house it was a handsome modern building well situated on rising i d and prejudice from his garden mr would have led them his two meadows hut the ladies not having shoes to the remains of a white frosty turned hack and while sir william accompanied him took her sister and friend over the house extremely well pleased to have the of it without her husband s help it was rather small hut well and convenient and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and of which gave all the credit when mr â ould be forgotten there was really a great air of comfort throughout and by s evident enjoyment of it elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten she had already learnt 
12,that lady was still in the country it was spoken of again while they were at dinner when mr joining in observed â yes miss elizabeth you will have the honour of seeing lady de on the sunday at church and i need not say you will be delighted with her she is all and condescension and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over i have scarcely any lion in saying that she will include you and my sister in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here her behaviour to my dear is charming we dine at twice every week and are never allowed to walk home her s carriage is regularly ordered for us i should say one of her lady ship s carriages for she has several lady is a very respectable sensible woman indeed added and a most attentive hour very true my dear that is exactly what i say she is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference the evening was spent chiefly in talking over news and telling again what had been already written and when it closed elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to upon s degree of contentment to understand her address in guiding and com iâ prejudice in bearings with her husband and to acknowledge that it was all done very well she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass the quiet of their usual the of mr and the of their intercourse with a lively imagination soon settled it all about the middle of the next day as she was in her room getting ready for a walk a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion and after listening a moment she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry and calling loudly after her she opened the door and met maria in the landing place who breathless with agitation cried out t oh my dear pray make haste and come into the dining room for there is such a sight to be seen i will not tell you what it is make haste and come down this moment elizabeth asked questions in vain maria would tell nothing more and down they ran into the dining room which the lane in quest of this wonder it was two ladies stopping in a low at the garden gate and is this all cried elizabeth i expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden and here is nothing but lady and her daughter la my dear said maria quite shocked at the mistake it is not lady the old lady is mrs who lives with them the other is miss de only look at her she is quite a little creature who would have thought she could be so thin and small she is rude to keep out of doors in all this wind why does she not come in oh says she hardly ever does it is the greatest of when miss de comes in i like her appearance said elizabeth struck with other ideas she looks sickly and cross yes she will do for him very well she will make him a very proper wife mr and were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies and sir william to elizabeth s high diversion was stationed in the doorway i and in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him and constantly bowing whenever miss de looked that way at length there was nothing more to be said the ladies drove on and the others returned into the house mr col no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune which explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at the next day chapter mb s triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete the power of displaying the grandeur of his to his wondering and of letting them see her civility himself and his wife was exactly what he had wished for and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of lady s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough i confess said he that i should not have been at all surprised by her s asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at i rather expected from my knowledge of her that it would happen but who could have foreseen such an attention as who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately after your arrival â i am the less surprised at what has happened replied sir william from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire about the court such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to mr was carefully them in what they were to expect that the sight of such rooms so many servants and so splendid a dinner might not wholly them pride and when the ladies were for the he said to elizabeth â do not make yourself uneasy my dear cousin about your apparel lady is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and daughter i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest there is no occasion for any thing lady will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed she likes to have the dis of rank preserved while they were dressing he came two or three times to their different doors to recommend their being quick as lady very much objected to be 
12,kept waiting for her dinner such formidable accounts of her and her manner of living quite frightened maria who had been little used to company and she looked ward to her introduction at with as much apprehension as her father had done to his at st james s as the weather was fine they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park every park has its beauty and its prospects and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with though she could not be in such ar mr expected the scene to inspire and was but slightly affected by his of the windows in front of the house and his relation of what the altogether had originally cost sir de when they ascended the steps to the hall maria s alarm was every moment increasing and even sir william did not look perfectly calm elizabeth s courage did not fail her she had heard nothing of lady that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue and the mere of money and rank she thought she could witness without from the entrance hall of which mr pointed out with a air the fine proportion and finished ornaments they followed the servants through an to the room where lady her daughter and mrs were sitting her with great condescension arose to receive them and as mrs pride and prejudice had settled it with her husband that the office of tion should be hers it was performed in a proper mai without any of those apologies and thanks which he v have thought necessary in spite of having been at st james s sir so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow take his seat without saying a word and his frightened almost out of her senses sat on the edge of chair not knowing which way to look f herself quite equal to the scene and could observe the ladies before her lady was a large woman with strongly marked features which n once have been handsome her air was not nor was her manner of receiving them such as to forget their inferior rank she was not formidable by silence but whatever she said was in so a tone as marked her self and brought mr immediately to mind and from the observation of the day altogether believed lady to be exactly what he had presented when after examining the mother in whose and she soon found some mr she turned her eyes on the daughter could almost have joined in maria s astonishment at being so thin and so small there was neither in fi nor face any likeness between the ladies miss de bo was pale and sickly her features though not plain insignificant and she spoke very little except in a voice to mrs in whose appearance there nothing remarkable and who was entirely engage listening to what she said and placing a screen in proper direction before her eyes after sitting a few minutes they were all sent to o the windows to admire the view mr them to point out its beauties and lady ki informing them that it was much better worth in the summer the dinner was exceedingly handsome and there â and all tiie servants and all the articles of plate which mr had promised and as he had likewise foretold he took his seat at the of the table by her s desire and looked as if he felt that life could furnish thing greater he carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity and every dish was commended first hy him and then hy sir william who was now enough re covered to echo whatever his son in law said in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady could hear but lady seemed gratified hy their excessive admiration and gave most gracious smiles especially when any dish on the proved a novelty to them the party did not supply much conversation was ready to speak whenever there was an opening hut she was seated between and miss de â the former of whom was engaged in listening to lady and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time mrs was employed in watching how little miss de ate pressing her to try some other dish and fearing she was maria thought speaking out of the question and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire when the ladies returned to the drawing room there was little to be done but to hear lady talk which she did without any till coffee came in delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment she into s domestic concerns familiarly and and gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady s attention which could furnish her with an occasion of to others in the intervals of her discourse with mrs she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth but especially to the latter of whose connections she knew the least and who she observed to mrs was a very genteel pretty kind of girl e aa is different times how many sisters she ride and prejudice were older or younger than herself whether any of were likely to he married whether they were handsome where they had heen educated what carriage her father kept and what had heen her mother s maiden name elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions hut answered them very lady then observed â your father s estate is on mr i think for your sake turning to i 
13,am glad of it hut otherwise i see no occasion for estates from the female line it was not thought necessary in sir de s family do you play and sing miss v a uttle oh then â some time or other we shall be happy to bear you our instrument is a capital one probably superior to â you shall try it some day do your sisters play and sing one of them does why did not you all learn you ought all to have learned the miss all play and their father has not so good an income as yours do you draw no not at all what none of you not one that is very strange but i suppose you had no opportunity your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters my mother would have no objection but my father hates london has your left you we never had any no how was that possible five daughters brought up at home without a i never heard of such a thing your mother must have been quite a slave to your education elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been the case then who taught you who attended to you without a you must have been neglected and compared with some families i believe we were but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means we were always encouraged to read and had all the masters that were necessary those who chose to be idle certainly might ay no doubt but that is what a will prevent and if i had known your mother i should have advised her most to engage one i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction and nobody but a can give it it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way i am always glad to get a young person well placed out four of mrs are most delightfully situated through my means and it was but the other day that i recommended another young person who was merely accidentally mentioned to me and the family are quite delighted with her mrs did i tell you of lady s calling yesterday to thank me she finds miss pope a treasure lady said she you have given me a treasure are any of your younger sisters out miss yes ma am all all what all five out at once very odd and you only the second the younger ones out before the elder are married your younger sisters must be very young yes my youngest is not sixteen perhaps she is full young to be much in company but really ma am i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or to marry early the last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first and to be kept back on such a motive i think it would not be very likely to promote affection or delicacy of mind upon my word said her you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person pray what is your age with three younger sisters grown up replied l and prejudice smiling your can hardly expect me to own it lady seemed quite astonished at not a direct answer and elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence you cannot be more than twenty i am sure â therefore you need not conceal your age i am not one and twenty when the gentlemen had joined them and tea was over the card tables were placed lady sir and mr and mrs sat down to and as miss de chose to play at the two girls had the honour of assisting mrs to make up her party their table was stupid scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game except when mrs expressed her fears of miss de s being too hot or too cold or having too much or too little light a great deal more passed at the other table lady was generally speaking â stating the mistakes of the three others or relating some anecdote of herself mr was employed in agreeing to every thing her said thanking her for every fish he won and if he thought he won too many sir william did not say much he was his memory with anecdotes and noble names when lady and her daughter had played as long as they chose the tables were broken up the carriage was offered to mrs gratefully accepted and im ordered the party then gathered round the fire to hear lady determine what weather they were to have on the morrow from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach and with many speeches of on mr s side and as many bows on sir william s they departed as soon as they had driven from the door elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at which for s sake she made more favourable than it really was but her though her some trouble could by no means satisfy pride and mr and he was ver r soon to take heir s praise into his own chapter xxx sir william staid only a week at but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter s being most comfortably settled and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with while sir william was with mr devoted his mornings to driving him out in his and show ing him the country but when he 
13,went away the whole family returned to usual and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and writing and looking out of window in his own book room which the road the room in which the ladies sat was backwards elizabeth at first had rather wondered that should not prefer the dining parlour for common use it was a better sized room and had a pleasanter aspect but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did for mr would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively and she gave credit for the arrangement from the drawing room they could distinguish nothing in the lane and were indebted to mr for the knowledge of what carriages went along and how often especially miss de drove by in her which he never failed coming to inform them of though it happened almost every day she not stopped at the and had a few minutes conversation with but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out very few days passed in which mr did not walk to and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise and till elizabeth recollected l pride and that there might be other family to be disposed c she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours now and then they were honoured with a call from her and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits she examined into their looked at their work and advised them to do it differently found fault with the arrangement of the furniture or detected the in and if she accepted any refreshment seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that mrs joints of meat were too large for her family elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county she was a most active magistrate in her own parish the concerns of which were carried to her by mr and whenever any of the were disposed to be discontented or too poor she forth into the village to settle their differences silence their complaints and them into harmony and plenty the entertainment of dining at was repeated about twice a week and allowing for the loss of sir william and there being only one card table in the evening every such entertainment was the of the first their other engagements were few as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general was beyond the reach this however was no evil to elizabeth and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough there were half hours of pleasant conversation with and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great enjoyment out of doors her favourite walk and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady was along the open grove which edged that side of the park where there was a nice sheltered path which no one seemed to value but herself and where she felt beyond the reach of lady s curiosity in this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away was approaching and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at which in so small a circle must be important and prejudice elizabeth had beard soon after her arrival that mr was expected there in the course of a few weeks and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their parties and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss s designs on liim were by his behaviour to his cousin for whom he was evidently destined by lady who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss and herself his arrival was soon known at the for mr was walking the whole morning within view of the opening into lane in order to have the earliest assurance of it and making his bow as the carriage turned into the park hurried home with the great intelligence on the following morning he hastened to to pay his respects there were two of lady to require them for mr had brought with him a colonel the younger son of his uncle lord and to the great surprise of all the party when mr returned the gentlemen accompanied him had seen them from her husband s room crossing the road and immediately running into the other told the girls what an honour they might expect adding â i may thank you for this piece of civility mr would never have come so soon to wait upon me elizabeth had scarcely time to all right to the compliment before their approach was announced by the door bell and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room colonel who led the way was about thirty not handsome but in person and address most truly the gentleman m r looked just as he bad been used to look in paid his compliments with his usual reserve to mrs and what ever might be his feelings towards her friend met her with l f pride and b every appearance of composure elizabeth to him without saying a word colonel entered into directly with the readiness and ease of a well bred man and talked very pleasantly but his cousin after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to mrs sat for some time without 
13,speaking to any body at length however his civility was so far awakened as to of elizabeth after the health of her family she answered him in the usual way and after a moment s pause added â my eldest sister has been in town these three is have you never happened to see her there she was perfectly sensible that he never had but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the and jane and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss the subject was pursued no farther and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away chapter colonel s manners were very admired at the and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at it was some days however before they received any invitation thither for while there were in the house they could not be necessary and it was not till day almost a week after the gentlemen s arrival that they were honoured by such an attention and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening for the last week they had seen very little of either lady or her daughter colonel william had called at the more than once during the time but mr they had only seen at church ride and the invitation was accepted of course and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady s her received them hut it was plain that their company was hy no means so as when she could get nobody else and she was in fact almost engrossed by her speaking to them especially to much more than to any other person in the room colonel seemed really glad to see them thing was a welcome relief to him at and mrs s pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much he now seated himself by her and talked so agreeably of and of travelling and staying at home of new books and music that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before and they conversed with so much spirit and flow as to draw the attention of lady herself as well as of mr his eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity and that her after a while shared the feeling was more openly acknowledged for she did not scruple to call out â what is that you are saying what is it you are talking of what are you telling miss let me hear what it is we are speaking of music madam said he when no longer able to avoid a reply of music then pray speak aloud it is of all subjects my delight i must have my share in the con if you are speaking of music there are few people in england i suppose who have more true enjoyment of music than myself or a natural taste if i had ever learnt i should have been a great and so would anne if her health had allowed her to apply i am confident that she would have performed how does get on mr spoke praise of his sister s i am very glad to hear such a good account of her said lady ca and pray tell her from me that l pride and she cannot expect to if she does not practise a great deal i assure you madam he replied that she does not need such advice she yery constantly so much the it cannot he done too much and when i next write to her i shall her not to neglect it on any account i often tell young that no excellence in music is to he acquired without constant practice i have told miss several times that she will never play really well unless she more and though mrs has no instrument she is very welcome as i have often told her to come to every day and play on the piano in mrs s room she would he in nobody s way you know in that part of the house mr looked a little ashamed of his s ill breeding and made no answer when coffee was over colonel reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him and she sat down directly to the instrument he drew a chair near her lady listened to half a song and then talked as before to her other nephew till the latter walked away from her and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair s countenance elizabeth saw what he was doing and at the first convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile and said â you mean to frighten me mr by coming in all this state to hear me but i i ill not be alarmed though your sister does play so well there is a about me that never can bear to be frightened at the of others my courage always rises with every attempt to me i shall not say that you are mistaken he replied because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find â great enjoyment in occasionally opinions which in fact are not your own and heartily at this picture of herself and said to colonel your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me and teach you not to believe a word i say i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character in a part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit indeed mr it 
13,is very un generous in you to mention all you knew to my in â and give me leave to say very for it is provoking me to and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear i am not afraid of you said he pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of cried colonel i should like to know how he among strangers â you shall hear then â but prepare for something very dreadful the first time of my ever seeing him in you must know was at a ball â and at this ball what do you think he did he danced only four dances i am sorry to pain you but so it was he danced only four dances though gentlemen were scarce and to my certain knowledge more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner mr you cannot deny the fact i had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party true and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room well colonel what do i play next my fingers wait your orders perhaps said i should have judged better had i sought an introduction but i am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers shall we ask your cousin the reason of this said elizabeth still addressing colonel shall we ask him why a man of sense and education and who has lived in the world is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers i can answer your question said without applying to him it is because he wiu not give himself the trouble and i certainly have not the talent which people said of conversing easily with those i have seen before i cannot catch their tone of conversation or appear interested in their concerns as i often see done my fingers said elizabeth do not move over this instrument in uie manner which i see so many women s do they have not the same force or rapidity j and do not produce the same expression but then i have always supposed it to be my own fault â because i would not take the trouble of it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other woman s of superior execution smiled and said you are perfectly right you i have employed your time much better no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think any thing wanting we neither of us perform to strangers here they were interrupted by lady who called out to know what they were talking of elizabeth immediately began playing again lady ap and after listening for a few minutes said to g â h miss would not play at all amiss if she c more and could have the advantage of a london master she has a very good notion of though l er taste is not equal to anne s anne would have been a delightful had her health allowed her to learn i elizabeth looked at to see how cordially he i assented to his cousin s praise but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de she derived this comfort for miss that he might have been just as likely to marry her had she been his relation lady continued her remarks on elizabeth s performance mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility and at the request of the gentle men remained at the instrument till her s carriage was ready to take them all home pride and chapter elizabeth was sitting by the next morning and writing to jane while mrs and maria were gone on business into the village when she was startled by a ring at the door the certain signal of a as she had heard no carriage she thought it not unlikely to be lady and under that apprehension was putting away her half finished letter that she might escape all questions when the door opened and to her very great surprise mr and mr only entered the room he seemed astonished too on finding her alone and for his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within they then sat down and when her after were made seemed in danger of sinking into total silence it was absolutely necessary therefore to think of something and in this when she l d seen him last in and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure she observed â how very suddenly you all quitted last november mr it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr to see you all after him so soon for if i recollect right he went but the day before he and his sisters were well i hope when you left london perfectly so i thank you she found that she was to receive no other answer and after a short pause added â i think i have understood that mr has not much idea of ever returning to again i have never heard him say so but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future he has many friends and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing if he means to be but little at it would pride and prejudice be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then we might get a settled family there but perhaps mr did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same 
14,principle i should not be surprised said iâ he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers elizabeth made no answer she was afraid of talking longer of his friend and having nothing else to say was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a to him he took the hint and soon began with this seems a very comfortable house lady i believe did a great deal to it when mr first came to believe she did â and i am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object mr appears very fortunate in choice of a wife yes indeed his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made him happy if they had my friend has an excellent understanding â though am not certain that i consider her marrying mr as the wisest thing she ever did she seems perfectly happy however and in a light it is certainly a very good match for her it must be very agreeable to her to be settled within easy a distance of her own family and friends an easy distance do you call it it is nearly fifty miles and what is fifty miles of good road little more than half a day s journey yes i call it a very easy distance should never have considered the distance as one of the of the match cried elizabeth i should never have said mrs was settled near her family it is a proof of your own attachment to any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of i suppose would appear far ft pride and prejudice as he there was a sort of smile which fancied she understood he must be supposing her to be thinking of jane and and she blushed as she answered â i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family the far and the near must be and depend on many varying circumstances where there is fortune to make the expense of travelling distance becomes no evil but that is not the case here mr and mrs have a comfortable income but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys â and i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance mr drew his chair a uttle towards her and said you cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment you cannot have been always at elizabeth looked surprised the experienced some change of feeling he drew back his chair took a newspaper from the table and glancing over it said in a colder voice â are you pleased with a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued on either side calm and â and soon put an end to by the entrance of and her sister just returned from their walk the the d surprised them mr related the mistake which had occasioned is on miss and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body went away what can be the meaning of this said as soon as he was gone my dear he must be in love with you or he never have called on us in this familiar way but when elizabeth told of his silence it did not seem very likely even to s wishes to be the case and after various conjectures they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of any thing to do which was the more probable from the time of year all held sports were over w t i xi ow was lady books and a tâ â x and cannot be always within doors and in the of the or the of the walk to it of of the people who lived in it the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day they called at various times of the morning sometimes separately sometimes together and now and then accompanied by their aunt it was plain to them all that colonel came because he had pleasure in their society a persuasion which of course recommended him still more and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him as well as by his evident of her of her former favourite george and though in comparing them she saw there was less softness in colonel s manners she believed he might have the best informed mind but why mr came so often to the it was more difficult to understand it could not be for society as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips and when he did speak it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice â a sacrifice to propriety not a pleasure to himself he seldom appeared really animated mrs knew not what to make of him colonel s occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was generally different which her own knowledge of him could not have told her and as she would have liked to believe this change the of love and the object of that love her friend â she set herself seriously to work to find it out she watched him whenever they were at and whenever he came to but without much success he certainly looked at her friend a great deal but the expression of that look was it was an earnest steadfast gaze but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the of his being partial to her but elizabeth always laughed at the idea and mrs did not think it right to press the subject from the danger of raising expectations which might 
14,only end in disappointment for and in ber opinion it admitted not of a doubt tbat all ber friend s dislike would if she could suppose bim to be in ber power in ber kind for she sometimes planned her marrying colonel he was beyond comparison tbe man be certainly admired ber and bis situation in life was most eligible but to advantages mr bad considerable patronage in the church and his cousin could have none at all chapter more than once did elizabeth in ber within the park unexpectedly meet mr she felt all the per of the that should bring him where no one else was brought and to prevent its ever happening again took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd yet it did and even the third it seemed like wilful ill nature or a voluntary penance for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal and an awkward pause and then away but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her he never said a great deal nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much but it struck her in the course of their third that he was asking some odd questions â about her pleasure in being at her love of solitary walks and her opinion of mr and mrs s happiness and that in speaking of and her not perfectly understanding the house he seemed to expect that whenever she came into again she would be staying there too his words seemed to imply it could he have colonel in his thoughts she supposed if he meant any thing he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter it distressed her a little and she was and prejudice glad to find herself at the gate in the opposite the she was engaged one day as she walked in re jane s last letter and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits when instead of again surprised hy mr she saw on looking up that colonel was meeting her putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile she said â i did not know that you ever walked this way i have heen making the tour of the park he replied as i generally do every year and intended to close it with a call at the are you going much farther no i should have turned in a moment and accordingly she did turn and they walked towards the together do you certainly leave on saturday said she yes â if does not put it off again but i am at his disposal he the business just as he pleases and if not able to please himself in the arrangement he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice i do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr he likes to have his own way very well colonel but so we all do it is only that he has better means of having it than many others because he is rich and many others are poor i speak a younger son you know must be to self denial and dependence in my opinion the younger son of an earl can know very little of either now seriously what have you ever known of self denial and dependence when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or any thing you had a fancy for these are home questions â and perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature but in matters of greater weight i may suffer from the want of money younger sons cannot marry where they unless where they like women of fortune which i think they very often do and prejudice l l our habits of expense make us too dependent and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money is this thought elizabeth meant for me and she coloured at the idea but recovering herself said in a lively tone and pray what is the usual price of an younger son unless the elder brother is very sickly i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds he answered her in the same style and the subject dropped to interrupt a silence which might him fancy her affected what had passed she soon after wards said â i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal i wonder he does not marry to secure a lasting convenience of that kind but perhaps his sister does as well for the present and as she is imder his sole care he may do what he likes with her no said colonel that is an advantage which he must divide with me i am joined with him in the of miss are you indeed and pray what sort of a guardian do you make does your chaise give you much trouble young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage and if she has the true spirit she may like to have her own way as she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed likely to give them any uneasiness convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth she directly replied â you need not be frightened i never heard any harm of her and i dare say she is one of the most creatures in the world she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance mrs and miss i think i have 
14,heard you say that you know them i know them a little their brother is a pleasant gentleman like man â he is a great friend of s oh yes said elizabeth â mr it pride and prejudice uncommonly kind to mr and takes a prodigious deal of care of him care of him yes i really does take care of him in those points where he most wants care from something that he told me in our journey hither i have reason to think very much to him but i ought to his pardon for i have no right to sup pose that was the person meant it was all con what it you mean it is a circumstance which of course could not wish to he generally known if it were to get to the lady s family it would he an unpleasant thing you may depend upon my not mentioning it and that i have not much reason for sup it to he what he told me was merely this that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the of a most marriage hut without mentioning names or any other particulars and i only suspected it to he from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer did mr give you his reasons for this interference i understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady and what arts did he use to separate them he did not talk to me of his own arts said smiling he only told me what i have now told you elizabeth made no answer and walked on her heart swelling with indignation after watching her a little i asked her why she was so thoughtful i am thinking of what you have been telling me said she your cousin s conduct does not suit my feelings was he to be the judge you are rather disposed to call his interference i do not see what right mr had to decide on â t pride and l b he propriety of his friend s or why his own judgment alone he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy but she continued herself as we know none of the particulars it is not fair to condemn him it is not to bo supposed that there was much affection in the case that is not an unnatural said but it is the honour of my cousin triumph very sadly this was spoken but it appeared to her so just a picture of mr that she would not trust herself with an answer and therefore abruptly changing the con talked on indifferent matters till they reached the there shut into her own room as soon as their left them she think without interruption of all that she had heard it was not to be sup â posed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected there could not exist in the world two men over whom mr could have such boundless influence that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate mr and jane she had never doubted but she had always attributed to miss the principal design and arrangement of them if his own vanity however did not him he was the cause his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered and still continued to suffer he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate generous heart in the world and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted there were some very strong objections against the lady were colonel s words and these strong objections probably were her having one uncle who was a country attorney and another who was in business in london to jane herself she exclaimed there could be no possibility of objection â all loveliness and goodness as she is her understanding excellent her mind improved and her manners neither could any thing be urged against my father who though with some peculiarities has abilities which mr himself need not m l pride and prejudice disdain and respectability which he will probably never reach when she thought of her mother indeed her confidence gave way a little but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with mr whose pride she was convinced would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend s connections than from their want of sense and she was quite decided at last that he had been governed by this worst kind of pride and partly by the wish of retaining mr for his sister the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a headache and it grew so much worse towards the evening that added to her to see mr it determined her not to attend her cousins to where they were engaged to drink tea mrs seeing that she was really did not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her but mr could not conceal his apprehension of lady s being rather displeased by her staying at home end of the first volume pride and pre volume the second chapter i when they were gone elizabeth as if intending to herself as much as possible against mr chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in they contained no actual complaint nor was there any revival of past or any communication of present suffering but in all and in almost every line of each there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to her style and which proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with 
14,itself and kindly disposed towards every one had been scarcely ever clouded elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal mr s shameful of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a sense of her sisters it was some to think that his visit to was to end on the day after the next and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again and enabled to contribute to e recovery of her spirits by all that affection could do she could not think of s leaving without remembering that his cousin was to go with him but colonel had made it clear that had no in at all and agreeable as he was she did not mean to be unhappy about him while settling this point she was suddenly roused by die sound of the door bell and her spirits were a little fluttered hj the idea of its being colonel him â u l and self who had once before called late in the evening and might now come to particularly after her but this idea was soon banished and her spirits were very differently affected when to her utter amazement she saw mr walk into the room in a hurried manner he immediately began an after her health his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better she answered him with cold civility he sat down for a few moments and then getting up walked about the room elizabeth was surprised but said not a word after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner and thus began â in vain have i struggled it will not do my feelings will not be repressed you must allow me to tell you how i admire and love you elizabeth s astonishment was beyond expression she stared coloured doubted and was silent this he con sufficient encouragement and the of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately followed he spoke well but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride his sense of her inferiority of its being a degradation of the family ob which judgment had always opposed to inclination were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he but wa very unlikely to recommend his suit in spite of her deeply rooted dislike she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a man s affection and though her intentions did not vary for an instant she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive till roused to resentment by his subsequent language she lost all compassion in anger she tried however to compose herself to answer him with patience when he should have done he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of all his he had found impossible to conquer and with expressing his hope that it now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand as he said this she could easily see that he doubt of a favourable answer he spoke of â and l and anxiety but his countenance expressed real security such a circumstance could only farther and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks and she said â in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments however they may be returned it is natural that obligation should be felt and if i could feel gratitude i would now thank you but i cannot â i have never desired your good opinion and you have bestowed it most unwillingly i am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one it has been most unconsciously done however and i hope will be of short duration the which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little in it after this explanation mr who was leaning against the mantel piece with his eyes fixed on her face seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise his complexion became pale with anger and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature he was struggling for the appearance of composure and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it the pause was to elizabeth s feelings dreadful at length in a voice of forced calmness he said â and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting i might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little endeavour at civility i am thus rejected but it is of small importance i might as well replied she why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will against your reason and even against your character was not this some excuse for if i was but i have other you know i have had not my own feelings decided against you had they been indifferent or had they even been favourable do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the of perhaps for ever the happiness jf a most beloved sister u and as she pronounced these words mr changed colour but the emotion was and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued â i have every reason in the world to think ill of you no motive can excuse the unjust and part you acted there you dare not you cannot deny that you have been the principal if not the only means of dividing them from each other of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice 
15,and the other to its derision for disappointed hopes and them both in misery of the kind she paused and saw with no slight indignation that be was listening with an air which proved him wholly un moved by any feeling of remorse he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity can you deny that you have done it she repeated with assumed tranquillity he then replied i have no wish of denying that i did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister or that i rejoice in my success towards him i have been kinder than towards myself â the appearance of noticing this civil reflection but its meaning did not escape nor was it likely to her but it is not merely this affair she continued on which my dislike is founded long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr on this subject what can you have to say in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself or under what can you here impose upon others you take an eager interest in that gentleman s concerns said in a less tranquil tone and with a heightened colour y who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in him his misfortunes repeated contemptuously â yes his misfortunes have been great indeed and of your cried elizabeth with energy â and you have reduced him to his present state of comparative poverty you have withheld the advantages which you must to have been designed for him you have deprived the best years of his ufe of that which was no less his due than his desert you have done all this and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule and this cried as he walked with quick steps across the room iâ your opinion of me this is the estimation in which you hold me i thank you for explaining it so fully my according to this are heavy indeed but perhaps added he stopping in his walk and turning towards her these might have been overlooked had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design these bitter might have been suppressed had i with greater policy concealed my struggles and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by inclination by reason by reflection by every thing but disguise of every sort is my nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related they were natural and just could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own felt herself growing more angry every moment yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said â you are mistaken mr if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner she saw him start at this but he said nothing and she continued â you could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it again astonishment was obvious and he looked at pride her witli an expression of mingled incredulity and she went on â from the very beginning from the first moment may almost say of my acquaintance with you your man me with the fullest belief of your your conceit and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others were such as to form that of on which succeeding events have built so im a dislike and i had not known you a month be fore i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry you have said quite enough madam i perfectly comprehend your feelings and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness and with these words he hastily left the room and elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house the tumult of her mind was now painfully great she knew not how to support herself and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour her astonishment as she on what had passed was increased by every review of it that she should receive an offer of marriage from mr that he should have been in love with her for so many months so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friend s marrying her sister and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case was almost incredible it was to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection but his pride his abominable pride his of what he had done with respect to jane his able assurance in acknowledging though he could not justify it and the manner in which he had mentioned mr his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited she continued in very reflections till the sound of lady s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter s observation hurried her away to her room and prejudice i chapter ii elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes she could not yet recover from the surprise of what 
15,had hap â it was impossible to think of any thing else and totally for employment she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk hen the of mr s sometimes coming there stopped her and instead of entering the park she turned up the lane which led her farther from the road the park was still the boundary on one side and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground after walking two or three times along that part of the lane was tempted by the of the mornings to stop at the gates and look into the park the five weeks which she had now passed in had made a great difference in the country and every day was adding to the of the early trees she was on the point of continuing her walk when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park he was moving that way and fearful of its being mr she was directly retreating but the person who advanced was now near enough to see her and stepping forward with eagerness pronounced her name she had turned away but on hearing herself called though in a voice which proved it to be mr she moved a ain towards the gate he had by that time reached it also and holding out a letter which she instinctively took said with a look of haughty composure i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you will you do me the honour of reading that letter and then with a slight bow turned again into the plantation and was soon out of sight with no expectation of pleasure but with the strongest curiosity elizabeth opened the letter and to her still in wonder perceived an envelope containing two pride sheets of letter paper written quite through in a close hand the envelope itself was likewise full pursuing her way along the lane she then it it was dated from at eight o clock in the mornings and was as follows â be not alarmed madam on receiving this letter by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those which were last ni t â disgusting to you i write without any intention of you or myself by dwelling on wishes which for the happiness of both cannot be too soon forgotten and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion should have been spared had not my character required it to be written and read you must therefore pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention your feelings i know wiu bestow it willingly but i demand it of your justice two of a very different nature and by no means of equal magnitude you last night laid to my charge the first mentioned was that regardless of the sentiments of either i had detached from your sister â and the other that i had in defiance of various in defiance of honour and humanity ruined the immediate prosperity and the prospects of mr and to have thrown off the companion of my youth the acknowledged favourite of my father a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage and who had been brought up to expect its exertion would be a to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks could bear no comparison but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed respecting each circumstance i shall hope to be in future secured when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read if in the explanation of them which is due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours i can only say that i am sorry the necessity must be obeyed and further apology would be absurd i had not been long in before i saw in common with others pride and prejudice that preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country but it was not till the evening of the dance at that i had any apprehension of his a serious attachment i had often seen him in love before at that ball while i had the honour of dancing with you i was first made acquainted by sir william s accidental information that s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage he spoke of it as a certain event of which the time could be from that moment i observed my friend s behaviour attentively and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him your sister i also watched her look and manners were open cheerful and engaging as ever but without any symptom of peculiar and i remained convinced from the evening s scrutiny that though she received his attentions with pleasure she did not invite them by any of sentiment if you have not been mistaken must have been in an error your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable if it be so if i have been by such error to inflict pain on her your resentment has not been unreasonable but i shall not scruple to assert that the serenity of your sister s countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a con that however amiable her temper her heart was not likely to be easily touched that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain but i will venture td say that my and are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it 
15,i believed it on impartial conviction as truly as i wished it in reason my objections to the marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me but there were other causes of causes which though still existing and existing to an equal degree in both instances i had myself endeavoured to forget because they were not immediately before me these causes must pride and prejudice be stated though briefly the situation of your mother s family though objectionable was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently so almost betrayed by herself by your three younger sisters and occasionally even by your father â pardon me â it pains me to offend you but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations and your displeasure at this representation of them let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister than it is honour able to the sense and disposition of both i will only say farther that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed and every heightened which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection he left for london on the day following as you i am certain remember with the design of soon returning the part which i acted is now to be explained his sisters uneasiness had been equally excited with my own our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered and alike sensible that no time was to be lost in their brother we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london we accordingly went â and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend tlie tain evils of such a choice i described and enforced them earnestly but however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage had it not been by the assurance which i not in giving of your sister s indifference he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere if not with equal regard but has great natural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own to convince him therefore that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point to persuade him against returning into hei when that conviction had been given was scarcely the work of a mo i cannot blame myself for having done thus much there is but one part of my conduct in le whole affair pride and prejudice which i do hot reflect with satisfaction it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sisters in town i knew it myself as ic was known to miss hut her is even yet ignorant of it that they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps hut his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger perhaps this concealment this disguise was me it is done however and it was done for the on this subject i have nothing more to say no other apology to offer if i have wounded your sister s feelings it was done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient i have not yet learnt to condemn them â with respect to that other more accusation of having injured mr i can only it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant hut of the truth of what i shall relate i can summon more than one witness of mr is the son of a very respectable man who had for many years the management of all the estates and whose good conduct in the discharge of hia trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him and on george who was his his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed my father supported him at school and afterwards at cambridge most important assistance as own father always poor from the extravagance of his wife have been unable to give him a gentleman s education my father was not only fond of this young man s society whose manners were always engaging he had also the highest opinion of him and hoping the church would be his profession in tended to provide for him in it as for myself it is many many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner the vicious the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself and who had opportunities of seeing him in mo pride and prejudice which mr could not have here again i shall give you pain â to what degree you only can tell but whatever may he the sentiments which mr has created a of their nature shall not prevent me from his real character it adds even another motive my excellent father died about five years ago and his attachment to mr was to the last so steady that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow and if he took orders desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as it e vacant there was also a of one thousand pounds his own father did not long survive mine and within half 
15,a year from these events mr wrote to inform me that having finally resolved against taking orders he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage in of the by which he could not he he had some intention he added of studying the law and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein i rather wished than believed him to be sincere but at any rate was perfectly ready to to his proposal i knew that mr ought not to be a clergyman the business was therefore soon settled he resigned all claim to assistance in the church were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it and accepted in return three thousand pounds all connection between us seemed now dissolved i thought too ill of him to invite him to or admit his society in town in town i believe he chiefly lived but his studying the law was a mere pretence and being now free from all restraint his life was a life of idleness and for about three years i heard little of him but on the of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him he applied to me again by letter for the his circumstances he assured me and i had no difficulty in believing it were exceedingly bad he had found the law a most study and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained if i would ride and present him to the living in question â of which he trusted there could be little as he well assured that i had no other person to provide for and i could not have forgotten my father s intentions you will hardly blame me for refusing to with this entreaty or for resisting every repetition of it his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances â and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself after this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropped how he lived i know not but last summer he was again most painfully on my notice i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to to any human being having said thus much i fed no doubt of your secrecy my sister who is more than ten years my junior was left to the of my mother s nephew co and myself about a year ago she was taken from school and an establishment formed for her in london and last she went with tlie lady who presided over it to and thither also went mr undoubtedly by design for there proved to have b n a prior acquaintance between him and mrs in whose character we were most unhappily deceived and by her and aid he so far recommended himself to whose heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an she was then but fifteen which must be her excuse and after stating her i am happy to add that i owed the knowledge of it to herself i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended and then unable to support the idea of and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father acknowledged the whole to me you may imagine what i felt and how i acted regard for my sister s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure but i wrote to mr who left the place immediately and mrs was of course removed from her charge mr s chief object and prejudice my sister s fortune which is thirty thousand pounds i cannot help supposing that the hope of liim self on me was a strong his revenge would have been complete indeed this madam is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together and if you do not absolutely reject it as false you will i hope me henceforth of cruelty towards mr i know not in what manner under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either detection could not be in your power and suspicion c not in your nation you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last t but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed for the truth of every thing here related i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel who from our near relationship and constant intimacy and still more as one of the of my father s will has been ted with every particular of these transactions if your of me should make my you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin and that there may be the possibility of consulting him i shall endeavour to find some of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning i will only add god bless you chapter iii if elizabeth when mr gave her the letter did not expect it to contain a renewal of his she had formed no expectation at all of its contents but such as they were it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them and what a of emotion they excited her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined with amazement did she first understand that he believed and any apology to be in his power and was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to which a sense of shame would not conceal with a 
16,strong prejudice against every thing he might say she b an his account of what had happened at she read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes his belief of her sister s she instantly resolved to be false and his account of the real the worst objections to the match made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice he expressed no regret for what he had done which her his style was not penitent but haughty it was all pride and insolence but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr m â when she read with somewhat clearer at a relation of events which if true must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth and which bore so alarming an to his own history of himself pâ her feelings were yet more painful and more difficult of definition astonishment apprehension and even horror oppressed her she wished to it entirely repeatedly exclaiming this must be false this cannot be this must be the falsehood â and when she had gone through the whole letter though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two put it hastily away protesting that she would not regard it that she would never look in it again in this state of mind with thoughts that could rest on nothing she walked on but it would not do in half a minute the letter was unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she could she again began the perusal of all that related to m and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence the account of his connection with the family was exactly what he had related him self and the kindness of the late mr though she had not before known its extent agreed equally well witli his own words so far each recital confirmed the t v pride and prejudice but when she came to the will the difference was great had said of the living was fresh in her and as she recalled his very words it was impossible not to feel that there was gross on one side or the other and for a few moments she flattered herself that her wishes did not but when she read and with the attention the particulars immediately following of s all pretensions to the living of his receiving in so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds again was she forced to hesitate she put down the letter weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be â on the probability of each statement â but little success on both sides it was only assertion again she read on but every line proved more clearly that the affair which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could represent as to render mr s conduct in it less than infamous was capable of a turn which must make him entirely throughout the whole the extravagance and general which he not to lay to mr s charge exceedingly shocked her the more so as she could bring no proof of its injustice she had never heard of him before his entrance into the in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who en meeting him accidentally in town had there renewed a slight acquaintance of his former way of life nothing had been known in but what he told himself as to his real character had information been in her power she had never felt a wish of his countenance voice and manner had established him at once in the of every virtue she tried to recollect some instance of goodness some trait of integrity or benevolence that might rescue him from tlie attacks of mr or at least by the of virtue for those casual errors imder which she would endeavour to class what mr had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance but no such recollection her she could see him instantly before her in every charm of air and address but she pride and prejudice could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess after pausing on this point a considerable while she once more continued to read but alas the story which followed of designs on miss received some confirmation what had passed between colonel and herself only the morning before and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel himself â from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin s affairs and whose character she had no reason to question at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr would never have such a proposal if he had not been well assured of his cousin s she perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between and herself in their first evening at mr s many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory she was now struck with the of such communications to a stranger and wondered it had escaped her before she saw the of putting himself forward as he had done and the of his professions with his conduct she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing mr â that mr might leave the country but that he should stand his ground yet he had avoided the ball the very next week she l also that till the family had quitted the country he had told his story to no one but herself but that after their removal 
16,it had been every where discussed that he had then no no scruples in sinking mr s character though he had assured her that for the father would always prevent his exposing the son how differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and and the of her fortune proved no n pride and prejudice longer the moderation of his wishes but hie eagerness to at any thing his behaviour to herself could have had no tolerable motive he had been deceived with regard to her fortune or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most shown â very lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter and in further justification of mr she could not but allow that when questioned by jane had long ago as his in the that proud and repulsive as were his manners she had never in the whole course of their acquaintance â an acquaintance which had brought them much together and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways â seen any thing that betrayed him to be or unjust â any thing that spoke him of or habits â that among his own connections he was esteemed and that even had allowed him merit as a brother and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling â that had his actions been what represented them so gross a of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world and that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man as mr was incomprehensible she grew absolutely ashamed of herself of neither nor could she think without feeling that she had been blind partial prejudiced absurd how have i acted she cried i who have myself on my i who have valued myself on my abilities who have often the generous of my sister and gratified my vanity in useless or distrust how humiliating is this discovery yet how just a humiliation had i been in love i could not have been more blind but vanity not love has been my folly pleased with the preference of one and offended by the neglect of the other on the very beginning of our acquaintance i have and ignorance and driven reason away where were concerned till this ment i never knew myself pride and from herself to jane from jane to her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her that mr s explanation there had appeared very insufficient and she read it again widely different was the effect of a second perusal how could she deny that credit to his in one instance wliich she had been obliged to give in the other he declared himself to have been totally of her sister s attachment and she could not help remembering s opinion had always been neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane she felt that jane s feelings though fervent were little displayed and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner not often united with great sensibility when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned in terms of yet reproach her sense of shame was severe the justice of uie charge struck her too forcibly for denial and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as having passed at the ball and as all his first could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers the compliment to herself and her sister was not it soothed but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self attracted by the rest of her family and as she considered that jane s had in fact been the work of her nearest tions and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such of conduct she felt depressed beyond any thing e had ever known before after wandering along the lane for two hours giving way to every variety of thought re considering events and herself as well as she could to a change so sudden and so important fatigue and a recollection of her long absence made her at length return home and she entered the house with the wish of appearing as usual and the resolution of such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation she was immediately told that the two gentlemen from n pride prejudice had each called during her absence mr only for a few minutes to take leave but that colonel had been sitting with them at least an hour hoping for her return and almost to walk after her till she could be found elizabeth could but just affect concern in him she really rejoiced at it colonel was no longer an object she could think only of her letter chapter iv the two gentlemen left the next morning and mr having been in waiting near the to make them his parting was able to bring home the pleasing of their appearing in very good and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at to he then hastened to console lady and her daughter and on his return brought back with great satisfaction a message from her that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her elizabeth could not see lady without that had she chosen it she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece nor could she think without a smile of what her s indignation would have been what would she have said how would she have behaved were questions with which she amused herself their first subject was 
16,the of the party i assure you i feel it exceedingly said lady i believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as i do but i am particularly attached to these young men and know them to be so much attached to me they were excessively sorry to go but so they always are the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last but seemed to feel it most and more i think than last year his attachment to certainly mr had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter lady observed after dinner that miss seemed out of spirits and immediately for it herself by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon she added â but if that is the case you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer mrs will be very glad of your company i am sure i am much obliged to your for your kind invitation replied elizabeth but it is not in my power to accept it i must be in town next saturday why at that rate you will have been here only six weeks i expected you to stay two months i told mrs so before you came there can be no occasion for your going so soon mrs could certainly spare you for another fortnight but my father cannot he wrote last week to hurry my oh your father of course may spare you if your mother can daughters are never of so much consequence to a father and if you will stay another month complete it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london for i am going there early in june for a week and as on does not object to the box there will be very good room for one of you â and indeed if the weather should happen to be cool i should not object to taking you both as you are neither of you large you are all kindness madam but i believe we must abide by our original plan lady seemed resigned mrs you must send a servant with them you know i always speak my and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves it is highly improper must contrive to send somebody i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing young women should always be properly guarded and attended s â ride and prejudice to their situation in life when my niece went to last summer i made a point of her having two men servants go with her miss the daughter of mr of and lady anne could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner i am excessively attentive to all those things you must send john with the young ladies mrs i am glad it occurred to me to mention it for it would really be to you to let them go alone my uncle is to send a servant for us oh your uncle he keeps a man servant does he i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things where shall you change horses oh of course if you mention my name at the bell you will be attended to lady had many other questions to ask respecting their journey and as she did not answer them all herself attention was necessary which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her or with a mind so occupied she might have forgotten where she was reflection must be reserved for solitary hours whenever she was alone she gave way to it as die greatest relief and not a day went by without a solitary walk in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections mr s letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart she studied every sentence and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different when she remembered the style of his address she was still full of indignation but when she considered how she had condemned and him her anger was turned against herself and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion his attachment gratitude his general character respect but she could not approve him nor could she for a moment repent her refusal or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again in her own past behaviour there was a constant source of vexation and regret and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier they hopeless of remedy her father contented with at them would never exert to restrain the wild f pride and of his youngest daughters and her mother with manners so far from right herself was entirely insensible of the evil elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the of and but while they were supported by their mother s indulgence what chance could be of improvement weak spirited irritable and completely under s guidance had been always by their advice and self willed and careless would scarcely give them a hearing they were ignorant idle and vain while there was an officer in they would with him and while was within a walk of long they would be going there for ever anxiety on jane s behalf was another prevailing concern and mr s explanation by restoring to all her former good opinion heightened the sense of what jane had lost his affection was proved to have been sincere and his conduct cleared of all blame unless any could at to the of his confidence in his friend how grievous then was the thought that of a situation so desirable in every respect so with advantage so promising for happiness jane had been deprived by the folly and of her own family when to 
16,these recollections was added the of s character it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful their engagements at were as frequent during the last week of her stay as they had been at first the very last evening was spent there and her again into the particulars of their journey gave them directions as to the best method of packing and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way that maria thought herself obliged on her return to undo all the work of the morning and pack her trunk afresh when they parted lady with great wished them a good journey and invited them to come to again next year and miss de and exerted herself so far as to courtesy and hold out her hand to both chapter v on saturday morning elizabeth and mr met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared and he took the opportunity of paying the parting which he deemed necessary i know not miss elizabeth said he whether mrs has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it the favour of your company has been much felt i assure you we know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode our plain manner of living our small rooms and few and the little we see of the world must make extremely dull to a young lady like yourself but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment and the pleasure of being with and the kind at she had received must make her feel the obliged mr was gratified and with a more smiling solemnity replied â it gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not we have certainly done our best and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society and from our connection with the frequent means of varying the humble home scene i think we may flatter our selves that your visit cannot have been entirely irksome our situation with regard to lady s family is indeed the sort oi e â e and blessing which few can oa l ou pride and we are you see how continually we are engaged there in truths i must acknowledge that with all the of this humble i should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion while they are of our intimacy at words were insufficient for the elevation of his and he was obliged to walk about the room while â tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences you may in fact carry a very favourable report of us into my dear cousin i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so lady s great attentions to mrs you have been a daily witness of and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate â but on this point it will be as well to be silent only let me assure you my dear miss elizabeth that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage my dear and i have but one mind and one way of thinking there is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of and ideas between us we seem to have been designed for each other elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the ease and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts she was not sorry however to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprang poor it was melancholy to leave her to such society but had chosen it with her eyes open and though evidently that her were to go she did not seem to ask for compassion her home and her housekeeping her parish and her poultry and all their dependent concerns had not yet lost their charms at length the chaise arrived the trunks were fastened on the placed within and it was pronounced to be ready after an affectionate parting between the friends elizabeth was attended to the carriage m câ s â as they walked down the garden jâ â xi â v sâ her with his best respects to v i and his thanks for the kindness he had received at in the winter and his compliments to mr and mrs though unknown he then handed her in maria followed and the door was on the point of closed when he suddenly reminded them with some consternation that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of but he added you will of course wish to have your respects delivered to them with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here elizabeth made no objection the door was then allowed to be shut and the carriage drove off good gracious cried maria after a few minutes silence it seems but a day or two since we first came and yet how many things have happened a great many indeed said lier companion with a sigh we have dined nine times at besides drinking tea there twice how much i shall have to tell elizabeth privately added and how much shall have to conceal their journey was performed without much conversation or any alarm and within four hours of their leaving 
17,they reached mr s house where they were to remain a few da s jane looked well and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them but jane was to go home with her and at there would be leisure enough for observation it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for before she told her sister of mr s proposals to know that she had the of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane and must at the same time so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away was such a temptation to as nothing could have conquered but the state of in which remained as to the extent of what she should and her pride and if once entered on the subject of being hurried into repeating of which might only grieve her further chapter vi it was the second week in may in which the three young ladies set out together from street for the town of f in and as they drew near the appointed inn where mr s carriage was to meet them they quickly perceived in token of the coach man s both and looking out of a dining room up stairs these two girls had been above an hour in the place happily employed in visiting an op watching the on guard and dress ing a and after their sisters they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn usually exclaiming is not this nice is not this an agreeable surprise and we mean to treat you all added but you must lend us the money for we have just spent ours at the shop out there then showing her purchases â look here i have bought this bonnet i do not think it is very pretty but i thought i might as well buy it as not i shall pull it to pieces as soon as i get home and see if i can make it up any better and when her sisters abused it as ugly she added with â perfect oh but there were two or three much in the shop and when i have bought some prettier coloured satin to trim it with fresh i think it will be very tolerable besides it will not much signify what one wears this summer after the s hire have left and they are going in a fortnight are they indeed cried elizabeth with the greatest satisfaction they are going to be near and and i do so want to take us all there for the summer it would be such a delicious scheme and i dare say would hardly cost any thing at all mamma would like to go too of all things only think what a miserable summer else we shall have yes thought elizabeth that would be a delightful scheme indeed and completely do for us at once good heaven and a whole of soldiers to us who have been already by one poor regiment of and the monthly balls of now i have got some news for you said as they sat down to table what do you think it is excellent news capital news and about a certain person that we all like jane and elizabeth looked at each other and the waiter was told that he need not stay laughed and said â ay that is just like your formality and discretion you thought the waiter must hear as if he cared i dare say he often hears worse things said than i am going to say but he is an fellow i am glad he is gone i never saw such a long chin in my life well but now for my news it is about dear too good for the waiter is not it there is no danger of s marrying mary king â there s for you she is gone down to her uncle at liverpool gone to stay is safe and mary king is safe added elizabeth safe from a connection as to fortune she is a great fool for going away if she liked him but i hope there is no strong attachment on either side said jane i am sure there is not on his i will answer for never cared three about her who could about such a nasty little thing elizabeth was shocked to think that however incapable of such of herself the of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had for and fancied liberal as soon as all had ate and the elder ones paid the carriage was ordered and after some contrivance the and wh de with all their boxes and the unwelcome addition of s and s were seated in it how nicely we are crammed in cried i vn glad i bought my bonnet if it is only for the fun of having another band box well now let us be quite comfortable and snug and talk and laugh all the way home and in the first place let us hear what has hap to you all since went away have you seen any pleasant men have you had any i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back jane will be quite an old maid soon i declare she is almost three and twenty lord how ashamed i should be of not being married before twenty my aunt wants you so to get bands you can t think she says had better hav taken mr but do not think there would have been any fun in it lord how i should like to be married before any of you and then i would you about to all the balls dear me we had such a good piece of fun 
17,the other day at colonel s and me were to spend the day there and mrs pro to have a little dance in the evening by the by mrs and me are such friends and so she asked the two to come but was ill and so pen was forced to come by herself and then what do you think we did we dressed up in woman s clothes on purpose to pass for a lady â only think what fun not a soul knew of it but c and mrs and and me except my aunt for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns and you cannot imagine how well he looked when and and and two or three more of the men came in they did not know him in the least lord how i laughed and so did mrs i thought i should have died and that made the men suspect something and then they soon found out what was the matter with such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did assisted by s hints and additions endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to long o and prejudice elizabeth listened as little as she could but there was no escaping the frequent mention of s name their reception at home was most kind mrs rejoiced to see jane in beauty and more than once during dinner did mr say voluntarily to elizabeth â i am glad you are come back their party in the dining room was large for almost all the came to meet maria and hear the news and various were the subjects which occupied them lady lu was of maria across the table after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter mrs was doubly engaged on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane who sat some way below her and on the other them all to the younger miss and in a voice rather louder than any other person s was the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her oh mary said she i wish you had gone with us for we had such fun as we went along and me drew up all the blinds and pretended there was nobody in the coach and i should have gone so all the way if had not been sick and when we got to the george i do think we behaved very handsomely for we treated the other three with the cold luncheon in the world and if you would have gone we would have treated you too and then when we came away it was such fun i thought we never should have got into the coach i was ready to die of laughter and then we were so merry all the way home we talked and laughed so loud that any body might have heard us ten miles off to this mary very gravely replied far be it from me my dear sister to such pleasures they would doubtless be congenial with the of female minds but i confess they would have no charms for me i should infinitely prefer a book but of this answer heard not a word she seldom to any body for more than half a minute and never attended to mary at all in the afternoon was urgent with the rest of the an girls to walk to and see how every body went on but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme it should not be said that the miss could not be at home a day before they were in pursuit of the officers there was another reason too for her opposition she dreaded seeing ain and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible the comfort to her of the regiment s approaching removal was indeed beyond expression in a fortnight they were to go and once gone she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account she had not been many hours at home before she found that the scheme of which had given them a hint at the inn was under frequent discussion between her parents elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding but his answers were at the same time so vague and that her mother though often had never yet of succeeding at last chapter vii elizabeth s impatience to jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome and at length to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned and preparing her to be surprised she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr and herself miss bonnet s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings she was sorry that mr should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them but still more was she grieved for the which her sister s refusal must have given him his being so sure of succeeding was wrongs said she and certainly ought not to have appeared but consider how much it must increase his a and prejudice â indeed replied elizabeth i am heartily sorry for him but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his r ard for me you do not blame me however for refusing him blame you oh no but you blame me for having spoken so warmly of no â i do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did but you lot know it when i have told you what happened the very next day she then spoke of the letter repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george what a stroke was this for poor jane who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that 
17,so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here collected in one individual nor was s though grateful to her feelings capable of her for such discovery most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error and seek to clear one without the other this will not do said elizabeth you never will be able to make both of them good for any thing take your choice but you must be satisfied with only one there is but such a quantity of merit between them just enough to make one good sort of man and of late it has been shifting about pretty much for my part i am inclined to believe it all mr s but you shall do as you choose it was some time however before a smile could be from jane i do not know when i have been more shocked said she so very bad it is almost past belief and poor mr dear only consider what he must have such a disappointment and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too j and having to relate such a thing of his sister i it is really too distressing i am sure you must feel it so oh no my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both i know you will do him ample justice that i am growing every moment more and prejudice and indifferent your makes me saving and if you lament over him much longer my heart will be as light as a feather poor there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance such an and gentleness in his manner there certainly was some great in the education of those two young men one has got all the goodness and the other all the appearance of it i never thought mr so deficient in the ap of it as you used to do and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him without any reason it is such a spur to one s genius such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind one may be continually without saying any thing just but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty when you first read that letter i am sure you could not treat tlie matter as you do now indeed i could not i was uncomfortable enough i was very uncomfortable â i may say unhappy and with no one to speak to of what i felt no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and as i knew i had oh how i wanted you how unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of to mr for now they do appear wholly certainly but the misfortune of speaking with bit is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging there is one point on which i want your advice i want to be told whether i ought or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand s character miss paused a little and then replied surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully what is your own opinion that it ought not to be attempted mr has me to make his communication public on the contrary every particular relative to his sister was o pride and meant to be kept as much aa possible to myself and if i endeavour to people as to the rest of his conduct who will believe me the general prejudice against mr is so violent that it would be the death of half the good people in to attempt to place him in an amiable light i am not equal to it will soon be gone and therefore it will not signify to any body here what he really is some time hence it will be all found out and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before at present i will say nothing about it you are quite right to have his errors made public might him for ever he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done and anxious to re a character we must not make him desperate the tumult of elizabeth s mind was by this conversation she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight and was certain of willing listener in jane whenever i e might wish to talk again of either but there was still something lurking behind of which prudence the disclosure she dared not relate the other half of mr s letter nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend here was knowledge in which no one could partake and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last of mystery and then said she if that very improbable event should ever take place i shall merely be able to tell what may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself the liberty of communication cannot be mine tiu it has lost all its value she was now on being settled at home at leisure to observe the real state of her sister s spirits jane was not happy she still cherished a very tender for having never even fancied herself in love e her regard had all the warmth of first attachment and from her age and disposition greater than first attach ments often boast and so fervently did she value his remembrance and prefer him to every other man that ah pride and prejudice her good sense and all her attention to the feelings of her friends were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must 
17,have heen injurious to her own health and their tranquillity well said mrs one day what is opinion now of this sad of jane s for my part i am determined never to speak of it again to any body i told my sister so the other day but i cannot find out that jane saw any thing of him in london well he is a very young man â and i do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now there is no talk of his coming to again in the summer and i have of every body too who is likely to know i do not believe that he will ever live at â t any more oh well it is just as he chooses nobody wants him to come though i shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill and if i was her i would not have put up with it well my comfort is i am sure jane will die of a broken heart and then he will be sorry for what he has done but as elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation she made no answer well continued her mother soon afterwards and so the live very comfortable do they well well i only hope it will last and what sort of table do they keep is an excellent manager i dare say if she is half as sharp as her mother she is saving enough there is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping i dare say no nothing at all a great deal of good management depend upon it yes yes ey will take care not to their income hey will never be distressed for money well much good may it do them and so i suppose they often talk of having when your father is dead they look upon it quite as their own i dare say whenever that happens it was a subject which they could not mention before me o i and no it would have been strange if they had but i make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves if they be easy with an estate that is not their own so much the better should be ashamed of one that was only on me chapter viii the first week of their return was soon gone the second m began it was the last of the regiment s stay in and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping the was almost universal the elder miss alone were still able to eat drink and sleep and pursue the usual course of their very frequently were they reproached for this by and whose own misery was extreme and who could not comprehend such hard in any of the family good what is to become of us wliat are we to do would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe how can you be smiling so their affectionate mother shared all their grief she remembered what she had endured on a similar occasion twenty years ago i am sure said she i cried for two days together when colonel s regiment went away i thought i should have broke my heart i am sure i shall break mine said if one could but go to observed mrs ben net oh yes if one could but go to but papa is so disagreeable a little sea bathing would set me up for ever and my aunt is sure it would do me a great deal of good added such were the kind of perpetually through house elizabeth tried to be diverted by them but all sense of pleasure was lost in and she felt anew the justice of mr s objections and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend but the gloom of s prospect was shortly cleared away for she received an invitation from mrs the wife of the colonel of the regiment to accompany her to this invaluable friend was a very young woman and very lately married a resemblance in and good spirits had recommended her and to each other and out of their three acquaintance they had been intimate two the rapture of on this occasion her adoration of mrs the delight of mrs and the mortification of are scarcely to be described to her sister s feelings about the house in restless ecstasy calling for every one s congratulations and laughing and talking with more violence than ever whilst the continued in the parlour at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was i cannot see why mrs should not ask me as well as said she though i am not her particular friend i have just as much right to be asked as she has and more too for i am two years older in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable and jane to make her resigned as for elizabeth herself this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter and detestable as such a step must make her were it known she could not help secretly her father not to let her go she represented to him all the of s general behaviour the little ad she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs and the probability of her being yet more with such a companion at where the temptations must be greater than at home he heard her attentively and then said â will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other and we can never expect her and to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to hei family as under the present circumstances if 
18,you were aware said â of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of s and manner nay which has already arisen from it i am sure you would judge differently in the affair already arisen repeated mr what has she frightened away some of your lovers poor little but do be cast down such youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret come let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by s indeed you are mistaken i have no such injuries to resent it is not of peculiar but of general evils which i am now complaining our importance our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild the assurance and disdain of au restraint which mark s excuse me â for i must speak plainly if you my dear father will not take the trouble of checking her spirits and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life she will soon be beyond the reach of her character will be fixed and she will at sixteen be the most determined that ever made herself and her family ridiculous a too in the worst and meanest degree of without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person and from the ignorance and of her mind wholly unable to war off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite in this danger is also comprehended she will follow wherever leads vain ignorant idle and absolutely oh my dear father can you suppose it possible that they will not be and despised wherever they are known and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace mr saw that her whole heart was in the sub and affectionately taking her hand said in reply â do not make yourself uneasy my love and prejudice you and jane are known you must be respected and valued and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of â or i may say three â very silly sisters we shall have no peace at if does not go to let her go then colonel is a sensible man and will keep her out of any real mischief and she is too poor to be an object of prey to any body at she will be of less importance even as a common than she has been here the officers will find women better worth their notice let us hope therefore that her being there may teach her her own at any rate she cannot grow many degrees worse without us to lock her up for the rest of her life this answer elizabeth was forced to be content but her own opinion continued the same and she left him disappointed and sorry it was not in her nature ever to increase her by dwelling on them she was confident of having performed her duty and to fret over evils or them by anxiety was no part of her disposition had and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united in s imagination a visit to every possibility of earthly happiness she saw with the eye of fancy the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers she saw herself the object of attention to and to scores of them at present unknown she saw all the glories of the camp its tents stretched forth in of lines crowded with the young and the gay and dazzling with scarlet and to complete the view she saw herself seated beneath a tent tenderly ing with at least six officers at once had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these what would have been her sensations they could have been understood only by her mother who might have felt nearly the same s going to was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husband never intending to go there himself and prejudice but were entirely ignorant of what had passed and their with to the very day of s leaving home elizabeth was now to see mr for the last time having heen frequently in company with him since her return agitation was pretty well over the tions of former partiality entirely so she had even learnt i to detect in the very gentleness which had first delighted her an affectation and a to disgust and weary in his present behaviour to herself moreover she had a fresh source of displeasure for the inclination he soon of those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve after what had since passed to provoke her she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry and while she steadily repressed it could not hut feel the reproof contained in his believing that however long and for whatever cause his attentions had been withdrawn her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal on the very last day of the regiment s remaining in he dined with others of the officers at and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour that on his making some as to the manner in which her time had passed at she mentioned colonel s and mr s having both spent three weeks at and asked him if he were acquainted with the former he looked surprised displeased alarmed but with a moment s recollection and a returning smile replied that he had formerly seen him often and after observing that he was a very gentleman like man asked her how she had liked him her answer was warmly 
18,in his favour with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added how long did you say that he was at nearly three weeks and you saw him frequently yes almost every day his manners are very different from his cousin s and prejudice yes very different but i think mr on acquaintance indeed cried with a look which did not escape her and pray may i but checking himself he added in a tone is it in address that he has he to add aught of civility to his ordinary style for i dare not hope he continued in a lower and more serious tone that he is improved in oh no said elizabeth in i he is very much what he ever was while she spoke looked as if scarcely ing whether to over her words or to distrust their meaning there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention while she added â when i said that he improved on acquaintance i did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement but that from knowing him better his disposition was better understood s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look for a few minutes he was silent till shaking off his embarrassment he turned to her again and said in the of accents â you who so well know my feelings towards mr will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appear ance of what is right his pride in that direction may he of service if not to himself to many others for it must him from such foul as i have suffered by i only fear that the sort of to which you i imagine have been alluding is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe his fear of her has always i know when they were together and a good deal is to be to his wish of the match with miss de which i am certain he has very much at heart elizabeth could not repress a smile at this but she answered only by a slight of the head she and prejudice â aw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his and she was in no humour to indulge him the rest of the evening passed with the appearance on his side of usual cheerfulness hut with no i attempt to i ti distinguish elizabeth and they parted at last with mutual i p civility and possibly a desire of never meeting j again when the party broke up returned with mrs to from whence they were to set out early the next morning the separation between her and f her family was rather noisy than pathetic was the l f only one who shed tears but she did weep from vexation â and envy mrs was in her good wishes j for the felicity of her daughter and impressive in her in that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoy ing herself as much as possible â advice which there was every reason to believe would be attended to and in the happiness of herself in bidding the more gentle of her sisters were uttered being heard i chapter ix had elizabeth s opinion been all drawn from her own family she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of felicity or domestic comfort her father by youth and beauty and that appearance of which youth and beauty generally give had married a woman whose weak understanding and mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real for her respect esteem and confidence had vanished for ever and all his views of domestic happiness were but mr was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own had brought on in any of those plea which too often console the for their folly or their vice he was fond of the country and of books and from these tastes had arisen his principal e to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife but where other powers of entertainment are wanting the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given elizabeth however had never been blind to the of her father s behaviour as a husband she had always seen it with pain but respecting his abilities and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of obligation and decorum which in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children was so highly but she had never felt so strongly as now the which must attend the children of so a marriage nor ever so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill judged a direction of talents â talents which rightly used might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters even if incapable of the mind of his wife when elizabeth had rejoiced over s departure she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment their parties abroad were less varied than before and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant at the of every thing them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle and though might in time regain her natural degree oâ sense since the of her brain were removed her other sister from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a watering place 
18,and a camp upon the whole therefore she found what has been sometimes found before that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire did not in taking place bring all the satisfaction the had promised herself it was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of felicity to have some other point on which her wishes pride and prejudice and might be fixed and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation console herself for the present and prepare for another disappointment her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the of her mother and made inevitable and could she have included jane in the â every part of it would have been perfect but it is fortunate thought she that i have some thing to wish for were the whole arrangement complete my disappointment would be certain but here my carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my

defence of some little peculiar vexation when went away she promised to write very often and very to her mother and but her letters were always long expected and always very short those to her mother contained little else than that they were just returned from the library where such and such officers had attended them and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild that she had a new gown or a new which she would have described more fully but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry as mrs called her and they were going to the camp and from her correspondence with her

novelty and amusement one enjoyment was certain â that of as companions â a which comprehended health and temper to bear â cheerfulness to every and affection and intelligence which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad it is not the object of this work to give a description of nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay oxford worth c are sufficiently known a small part of is all the present concern tc the little town of the scene of mrs s former residence and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained they bent their steps after having seen all the principal wonders of the country and within five miles of elizabeth found from her aunt that was situated it was not in their direct road nor more than a mile or two out of it in talking over route the evening before mrs expressed an inclination to see the place again mr declared his and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation my love should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much said her aunt a place too with which so many of your acquaintance are connected passed all his youth there you know elizabeth was distressed she felt that she had no business at and was obliged to assume a tion for seeing it she must own that she was tired of great houses after going over so many she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains mrs abused her stupidity if it were merely a fine house richly furnished said she i should not care about it myself but the grounds are delightful they have some of the finest woods in the country pride and elizabeth said no more but her mind could not the possibility of meeting mr while the instantly occurred it would be dreadful she blushed at the very idea and thought it would â be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk but against this there were and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource if her private as to the absence of the family were answered accordingly when she retired at she asked the whether were not a very fine place 
19,what was the name of its proprietor and with no little alarm whether the family were down for the summer a most welcome negative followed the last question and her being now removed she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself and when the subject was revived the next morning and she was again applied to could readily answer and with a proper air of indifference that she had not really any dislike to the scheme to therefore they were to go chapter x elizabeth as they drove along watched for the first appearance of woods with some and when at length they turned in at the lodge her spirits were in a high flutter the park was very large and contained great variety of ground they entered it in one of its lowest points and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent elizabeth s mind was too full for conversation but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view they gradually ascended for half a mile and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence where the wood ceased and tlie eye was instantly caught by â b and situated on the side of a valley into which the road with some wound it was a large handsome stone building standing well on rising ground and backed by a ridge of high hills and in front a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater but without any artificial appearance its banks were neither formal nor adorned was delighted she had seen a place for which nature had done more or where natural beauty had been so little by an awkward taste they were all of them warm in their admiration and at that moment she felt to be mistress of might be something they descended the hill crossed the bridge and drove to the door and while examining the nearer aspect of the house all her apprehension of meeting its owner returned she dreaded lest the had been mistaken on applying to see the place they were admitted into the hall and elizabeth as they waited for the housekeeper had leisure to wonder at her being where she was the housekeeper came a respectable looking elderly woman much less fine and more civil than she had any notion of finding her they followed her into the it was a large well room handsomely fitted up elizabeth after slightly surveying it went to a window to enjoy its prospect the hill crowned with wood from which they had descended receiving increased from the distance was a beautiful object every disposition of the ground was good and she looked on the whole scene the river the trees scattered on its banks and the winding of the valley as far as she could trace it with delight as they passed into other rooms these objects were taking different positions but from every win dow there were beauties to be seen the rooms were lofty and handsome and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor but elizabeth saw with admiration of his taste that it was neither gaudy nor fine â with less of splendour and more real than the furniture of and of this place thought she i might have been mistress these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted instead of them as a stranger i might have rejoiced in as my own and welcomed to them as my and aunt bat no herself that could never be my and aunt would have been lost to me i not have been allowed to invite them this was a lucky recollection â it saved her firom something like regret she longed to of the housekeeper whether her master were really absent but had not courage for it at length however the question was asked by her and she turned away with alarm while mrs replied that he was adding but we expect him to morrow with a large party of friends how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day her aunt now called her to look at a picture she ap and saw the likeness of mr suspended amongst several other over the mantel piece her aunt asked her how she liked it the housekeeper came forward and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman the son of her late master s steward who had been brought up by him at his own expense he is now gone into the army she added but i am afraid he has turned out very wild mrs looked at her niece with a smile but â ii could not return it and that said mrs pointing to another of the is my master â and very like him it was drawn at the same time as the other â about years ago have heard much of your master s â ne person said mrs looking at the picture it is a handsome face but you can us it is like or not mrs s respect for elizabeth seem to in on this intimation of her knowing her master does that young lady know mr elizabeth and said a little p pride and and do not you think him a very gentleman ma am yes very i am sure i know none so handsome hut in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer larger picture of him than this this room was my late master s favourite room and these are just as they used to be then he was very fond of them this accounted to elizabeth for mr s being among them mrs then directed their attention to one of miss drawn when she was only eight years old and is miss as handsome as her brother said mr oh yes â the young lady that 
19,ever was seen and so accomplished she plays and sings all day long in the next room is a new instrument just come down for her â a present from my master she comes here to morrow with him mr whose manners were easy and pleasant encouraged her by his and remarks mrs either from pride or attachment had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister is your master much at in the course of the year not so much as i could wish sir but i dare say he may spend half his time here and miss is always down for the months except thought elizabeth when she goes to if your master would marry you might see more of him yes sir but i do not know when that will be i do not know who is good enough for him mr and mrs smiled elizabeth could not saying it is very much to his credit i am sure that you should think so i say no more than the truth and what every body will say that knows him replied the other elizabeth thought this was going pretty far and she listened with ft pride and prejudice increasing as the housekeeper added i have never had a cross word from him in my life and i have known him ever since he was four years old this was praise of all others most extraordinary most opposite to her ideas that he was not a good tempered man had heen her opinion her keenest attention was awakened she longed to hear more and was grateful to her for sayings â there are very few people of whom so much can he said you are lucky in having such a master yes sir i know i am if i were to go through the worlds i could not meet with a but i have always observed that they who are good natured when children are good natured when they grow up and he was always the sweetest tempered most generous hearted in the world elizabeth almost stared at her can this be mr thought she his father was an excellent said mrs ma am that he was indeed and his son will be just like him â just as to the poor â listened wondered doubted and was im patient for more mrs could interest her on no other point she related the subjects of the pictures the dimensions of the rooms and the price of the furniture in vain mr highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed her excessive of her master soon led again to the subject and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase he is the best landlord and best master said she that ever lived not like the wild young men days who think of nothing but themselves there is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name some people call him proud but i am sure i never saw any thing of it to my fancy it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men in what an amiable light does this place him thought elizabeth this fine account of him whispered her as p f they walked is not quite with his to our poor friend perhaps we might he that is not likely our authority was too good on reaching the spacious they were shown into a very pretty sitting room lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments and were informed that it was but just done to give pleasure to miss who had taken a liking to the room when last at he is certainly a good brother said â as she walked towards one of the windows mrs anticipated miss s delight when she should enter the room and this is always the way with him she added whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment there is nothing he would not do for her the picture and two or three ci the principal bed rooms were all that remained to be shown in the former were many good paintings but knew nothing of the art and from such as had been already visible below she had willingly turned to at some drawings of miss s in whose subjects were usually more interesting and also more intelligible in the gallery there were many family portraits but they could have little to ji the attention of a stranger elizabeth walked on in quest the only face whose features would be known to her at last it and she a striking resemblance of mr with such a smile over the face as she remembered io have sometimes seen when he looked at her she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery informed them that it had been taken in hia father s lifetime there was certainly at this moment in s mind a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance the com bestowed on him by mrs was of n i s nature what praise is more valuable than the pride and praise of an intelligent servant as a brother a landlord a master she considered how many people s happiness were in his ip how of pleasure or pain it was in his to bestow how much of good or evil must be done by him every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character and as she stood before the on whidi he was re presented and fixed his eyes upon herself she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before she remembered 
19,its warmth and softened its of expression when all of the house that was open to general had been seen they returned down stairs and taking leave of the housekeeper were consigned over to the gardener who met them at the hall door as they walked across the lawn towards the river â li turned back to look again her uncle and stopped also and while the former was as to the date of the building the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the they were within twenty yards of each other and so abrupt was his appearance that it was impossible to avoid his sight their eyes instantly met and the cheeks of each were with the deepest blush he started and for a moment seemed immovable from surprise but shortly recovering himself advanced to wards the party and spoke to elizabeth if not in terms of perfect composure at least of perfect civility i e had instinctively turned away but stopping on his approach received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome had his first appearance or his resemblance to the picture they had just been ex been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw mr the gardener s expression of surprise on his master must have told it they a little aloof while he was talking to their niece who astonished and confused scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face and knew not what answer she returned to his civil after her family amazed at the pride and alteration of his manner since they last parted every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment and every idea of the of her being found there to her mind the few minutes in which they continued together were some of the most uncomfortable of her life nor did he seem much more at ease when he spoke his accent had none of its usual and he repeated his as to tlie time of her having left and of her stay in so often and in so hurried a way as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts at every idea seemed to fail him and after standing a few moments without saying a word he suddenly recollected himself and took leave the others then joined her and expressed their admiration of his figure but elizabeth heard not a word and wholly engrossed by her own feelings followed them in silence she was overpowered by shame and vexation her coming there was the most unfortunate the most ill judged thing in the world how strange must it appear to him in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again oh why did she come or why did he thus come a day before he was expected had they been only ten minutes sooner they been beyond the reach of his for it was plain that he was that moment arrived that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage she blushed again and again over the of the meeting and his behaviour so strikingly altered â what could it mean that he even speak to her was amazing â but to speak with such civility to after ber family never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting what a contrast did it to his last address in park when he put his letter into her hand she knew not what to think or how to account for it they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side ci the water and every step was bringing forward a nobler and prejudice fall of ground or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching hut it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it and though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out she distinguished no part of the scene her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of house it might be where mr then was she longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind in what manner he thought of her and whether in defiance of every thing she was still dear to him perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease yet there had been that in his voice which was not like ease whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell but he certainly had not seen her with composure at length however the remarks of her companions oh her absence of mind roused her and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself they entered the woods and bidding adieu to the river for a while ascended some of the higher grounds whence in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander were many charming views of the the opposite hills with the long range of woods many and occasionally part of the stream mr expressed a wish of going round the whole park but feared it might be beyond a walk with a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round it settled the matter and pursued the accustomed circuit which brought them again after some time in a descent among hanging woods to the edge of the water and one of its parts they crossed it by a simple bridge in character with the general air of the scene it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited and the valley here contracted into a room only for the stream and a narrow walk amidst the rough wood which bordered 
19,it elizabeth longed to explore its but when they had crossed the bridge and perceived distance from the house mrs who was not a great could go no farther and thought only d p and to the carriage as quickly as possible her niece was therefore obliged to submit and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the in the nearest direction but their progress was slow for mr though seldom able to indulge the taste was very fond of and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some in the water and talking to the man about them that he advanced but little whilst wandering on in this slow manner they were again surprised and elizabeth s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of mr approaching them and at no great distance the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side allowed them to see him before they met elizabeth however astonished was at least more prepared for an in than before and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness if he really intended to meet them for a few moments indeed she felt that he would probably strike into some other path the idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view the turning past he was immediately before them with a glance she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility and to imitate his politeness she began as they met to ad mire the beauty of the place but she had not got beyond the words delightful and charming when some unlucky recollections and she fancied that praise of from her might be her colour changed and she said no more mrs was standing a little behind and on her pausing he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared and she could suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had in his offer to herself what will be his surprise thought she when he knows who they are he takes them now for people of fashion the introduction however was immediately made and as she named their relationship to herself she stole a sly look at him to see how he bore it and was not without the expectation of bis as fast as he could from disgraceful companions that he was surprised by the connection was evident he sustained it however with fortitude and so far from going away turned back with them and entered into conversation with mr elizabeth could not but be pleased could not but triumph it was that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to she listened most attentively to all that passed between them and in every expression every sentence of her uncle which marked his his taste or his good manners the conversation soon turned upon fishing and she heard mr invite him with the greatest civility to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport mrs who was walking arm in arm with elizabeth gave her a look expressive of her wonder elizabeth said nothing but it gratified her exceedingly the compliment must be all for herself her astonishment however was extreme and continually was she repeating why is he so altered from what can it proceed it cannot be for me it cannot be my sake that his manners are thus softened my at could not work such a change as this it is impossible that he should still love me after walking some time in this way the two ladies in front the two gentlemen behind on their places after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water plant there chanced to be a little alteration it originated in mrs who fatigued by the exercise of the morning found elizabeth s arm inadequate to her support and consequently preferred her husband s mr took her place by her niece and they walked on together after a short silence the lady first spoke she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place and accordingly began by observing that his arrival had been very unexpected â for your housekeeper she added informed us that you would certainly not be here till dâ pride and to morrow and indeed before we left we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country he acknowledged the truth of it all and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling they will join me early to morrow he continued and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you â mr and his sisters elizabeth answered only by a slight bow her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr s name had been last mentioned between them and if she might ge from his complexion his mind was not very differently engaged there is also one other person in the party he continued after a pause who more particularly wishes to be known to you will you allow me or do i ask too much to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at the surprise of such an application was great indeed it was too great for her to know in what manner she to it she immediately felt that whatever desire miss might have of being acquainted with her must be the 
20,work of her brother and without looking farther it was satisfactory it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her they now walked on in silence each of them deep in thought elizabeth was not comfortable that was impossible but she was flattered and pleased his wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind they soon the others and when they had reached the carriage mr and mrs were half a quarter of a mile behind he then asked her to walk into the house but she de not tired and they stood together on the lawn at such a time much might have been said and silence was very awkward she wanted to talk but there seemed an on every subject at last she recollected that she had been travelling and they talked oi and with great perseverance yet time and prejudice s and her aunt moved slowly â and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the d was on mr and mrs s coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment but this was declined and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness mr handed the ladies into the carriage and when it drove off elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house the observations of her and aunt now began and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected he is perfectly well behaved polite and said her there is something a little stately in him to be sure replied her aunt but it is confined to his air and is not i can now say with the housekeeper that though some people may call him proud have seen nothing of it i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us it was more than civil it was really attentive and there was no necessity for such attention his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling â to be sure said her aunt he is not so hand some as or rather he has not s countenance for his features are perfectly good but how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable elizabeth excused herself as well as she could said that she had liked him better when they met in than before and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning but perhaps he may be a little in his replied her uncle your great men often are and therefore i shall not take him at his word about fishing as he might change his mind another day and warn me off his grounds elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character but said nothing from what we have seen of him continued mrs i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body as he has done by poor he has not an ill natured look â pride and on the there is something pleasing his mouth when he speaks and there is s of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an idea of his heart but to he sure the good lady who showed us the house did give him a most flaming i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes but he is a master i suppose and that in the eye of a servant every virtue elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in of his behaviour to and therefore gave them to understand in as guarded a manner as she could that by what she had heard from his relations in his actions were capable of a very different construction and that his character was by no means so nor s so as they had been considered in in confirmation of this she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected without actually her authority but stating it to be such as might be relied on mrs was surprised and concerned but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures every idea gave way to the charm of recollection and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its to think of any thing else fatigued as she had been by the morning s walk they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance and the evening was spent in the of an intercourse renewed after many years the of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends and she could do nothing but think and think with wonder of mr s civility and above all of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister chapter xl had settled it that mr would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of uie inn the whole of that morning but her conclusion was for on the very morning after their own arrival at these came they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends and were returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining witli the same family when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window and they saw a gentleman and lady in a driving up the street elizabeth immediately ng the livery guessed what it meant and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations by them with the honour which she expected her uncle and aunt were all amazement and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke joined to the circumstance itself and many of the circumstances of the preceding day opened to them a new idea on the business nothing had ever suggested 
20,it before but they now felt that there was no other way of for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece while these newly born notions were passing in their heads the of elizabeth s feelings was eveiy moment increasing she was quite amazed at her own but amongst other causes of she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said t much in her favour and more than commonly anxious to please she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her she retreated from the window fearful of being seen and as she walked up and down the room endeavouring to compose herself saw such looks of surprise in her uncle and aunt as made every thing worse miss and her brother appeared and this formidable introduction took place with astonishment did and elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least ai much embarrassed as herself since her being at she had heard that miss was exceedingly proud but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a miss was tall and on a larger scale than and though little more than sixteen her figure was formed and her appearance womanly and graceful she was less handsome than her brother but there was sense and good humour in her face and her manners were per and gentle elizabeth who had ex to find in her as acute and an observer as ever mr had been was much relieved by such different feelings they had not been long together before tom her that was also coming to wait on her and she had barely time to express her satisfaction and prepare for such a when s quick step was heard on the stairs and in a moment he entered the room all elizabeth s anger against him had been long done away but had she still felt any it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again he in a though general way after her family and looked and spoke with the same good humoured ease that he had ever done to mr and mrs he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself they had long wished to see him the whole party before them indeed excited a lively attention the suspicions which had just arisen of mr and their niece directed their observation towards each with an earnest though guarded and they soon drew from those the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love of the lady s sensations they remained a little in doubt but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough elizabeth on her side had much to do she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her she wanted to compose her own and to make herself agreeable to all pride prejudice and in the latter object where she feared most to fail she â most sure of success for those to whom she to give pleasure were in her favour was ready was eager and determined to be pleased in seeing her thoughts naturally flew to her sister and oh how did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her he was trying to trace a resemblance but though this might be imaginary she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss who had been set up as a rival to jane no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister on this point she was soon satisfied and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted which in her anxious interpretation a recollection of jane not by tenderness and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her had he dared he observed to her at a moment when the others were talking together and in a tone which had something of real regret that it was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her and before she could reply he added it is above eight months we have not met since the th of november when we were all dancing together at elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact and he afterwards took occasion to ask her when to by any of the rest whether all her sisters were at there was not much in the question nor in the preceding remark but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr himself but whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general and in al that he said she heard an accent so far removed from or disdain of his companions as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday and witnessed however temporary its existence might had at least one day when she saw him seeking the acquaintance and the good of pe le with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have heen a disgrace when she saw him thus not only to herself hut to the very whom he bad openly and recollected their last lively scene is the difference the change was so great and struck so forcibly on hâ r that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible never even in the company of his dear friends at or his dignified relations at had she seen him so desirous to please so free from self consequence or ing reserve 
20,as now when no importance could result from the success of his and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of and their stayed with them above half an hour and when they arose to depart mr called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing mr and mrs and miss to dinner at before they left the country miss though with a which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations readily obeyed mrs looked at her niece desirous of bow she whom the invitation most concerned felt disposed as to its acceptance but elizabeth had turned away her hei i however that this studied spoke ri ther a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal and seeing in her husband who was fond of society a perfect to accept it she ven red to engage for her attendance and the day after the next was fixed expressed great pleasure in the certainty of see ing elizabeth again having still a great deal to say to her and many to make after all their friends elizabeth all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister was pleased and on this account as well as some others found herself when their left them capable of considering the last half hour p and some satisfaction though while it waa the ti of it had been little eager to be alone and of or hints from her uncle and aunt stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of and then hurried away to dress but she had no reason to fear mr and mrs s curiosity it was not their wish to force her â hon it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr than they had before any idea of it was evident that he was very much in love with her they aw much to interest but nothing to justify of mr it was now a matter of anxiety to think well and as far as their acquaintance reached there was no to find they could not be untouched by his politeness and had they drawn character from their own feelings and hia servant s report any reference to any other account the circle in to which he was known would not have recognised it for mr there was now an interest however in believing the house keeper and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old and whose own manners indicated respectability was not to be hastily rejected neither had any thing occurred in the of their friends that could materially lessen its weight they had nothing to accuse him of but pride pride he probably had and if not it would certainly be by the inhabitants of a small market town where the family did not visit it was ac however that he was a liberal man and did much good among the poor with respect to the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood it was yet a well known fact that on his he had left many debts behind him which mr afterwards discharged as for elizabeth her thoughts were at this evening more than the last and the evening though as it passed it seemed long was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion and she lay q s s pride and prejudice awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out she certainly did not hate him no hatred had long ago and she had almost as long heen ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him that could be so called the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities though at first admitted had for some time ceased to be to her feelings and it was now heightened into somewhat of a nature by the testimony so highly in his favour and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a lights which yesterday had produced but above all above respect and esteem there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked it was gratitude â gratitude not merely for having once loved her but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the and of her manner in him and all the unjust accompanying her he who she had been persuaded would avoid her as his greatest enemy seemed on this accidental meeting most eager to preserve the acquaintance and without any display of regard or any peculiarity of manner where their two selves only were concerned was the good opinion of her friends and bent on making her known to his sister such a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but â for to love ardent love it must be attributed and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be aged as by no means though it could not be exactly defined she respected she esteemed she was grateful to him she felt a real interest in his welfare and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power which her fancy told her she still possessed of bringing on the renewal of his addresses it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and niece that such a striking civility as miss s in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at for she had reached it only to a late breakfast ought to be though it could not be equalled by some exertion of politeness 
20,on their side and consequently pride and prejudice that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at â the following morning they were therefore to go elizabeth was pleased though when she asked her self the reason she had very little to say in reply mr left them soon after breakfast the fish ing scheme had been renewed the day before and a engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at by noon chapter xii convinced as elizabeth now was that miss s dis like of her had originated in jealousy she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at must be to her and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady s side the acquaintance would now be renewed on reaching the house they were shown through the hall into the saloon whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer its windows opening to the ground admitted a most refreshing view of the high hills behind the house and of the beautiful oaks and spanish were scattered over the lawn in this room they were received by miss who was sitting there with mrs and miss and the lady with whom she lived in london s reception of them was very civil but attended with all that embarrassment which though proceeding from and the fear of doing wrong would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved mrs and her however did her justice and pitied her by mrs and miss they were noticed only by a courtesy and on their being seated a pause awkward as such pauses must always be succeeded for a few moments it was first broken by mrs a genteel agreeable looking woman whose endeavour to introduce some kind of proved her to be more truly well q â pride bred than either of die others and between her and with occasional help from elizabeth the con was carried on miss looked as if she wished for courage enough to in it and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard elizabeth soon saw that she was closely watched by miss and that she could not speak a word especially to miss without calling her attention this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance but was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much her own thoughts were her she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room she wished she feared the master of the house might be them and whether she wished or feared it most she could scarcely determine after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing miss s voice elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold after the health of her family she answered with equal and and the other said no more the next which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat cake and a variety of au the finest fruits in season but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs to miss had been given to remind her of her post there was now employment for the whole party for thou they could not au talk they could au eat and the beautiful of grapes and soon collected them round the table while thus engaged elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she moat feared or wished for the appearance of mr by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room then though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to she began to regret that he came he had been some time with mr who with two or three other gentlemen from the house was engaged the river and had left him only on that the pride and of the family intended a visit to that morning no sooner did he appear than elizabeth wisely resolved to he perfectly easy and â a resolution the more necessary to be made but perhaps not the more easily kept because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss s in spite of the smiles which her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects for jealousy had not yet made her and her attentions to mr were by no means over miss on her brother s entrance exerted herself much more to talk and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted and forwarded as much as possible every attempt at conversation on either side miss saw all this likewise and in the of took the first opportunity of saying with civility â pray miss are not the removed from they must be a great loss to your family in s presence she dared not mention s name but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment s distress but herself vigorously to the ill natured attack she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone while she spoke an involuntary glance showed her with a heightened complexion earnestly looking at her and his sister overcome with and unable to lift up her eyes had miss known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint but she had merely intended to elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in s opinion and perhaps to 
21,remind the latter of all the follies and by which some part of her family were connected with that corps not a syllable had ever pride and prejudice reached her of miss s meditated to no creature had it been led where secrecy was possible except to elizabeth and from all s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it from that very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him of their becoming hereafter her own he had certainly formed such a plan and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from it is probable that it might add something to hit lively concern for the welfare of his friend elizabeth s collected behaviour however soon his emotion and as miss vexed and disappointed dared not approach nearer to also recovered in time though not enough to be able to speak any more her brother whose eye she feared to meet scarcely recollected her interest in the and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned and while mr was attending them to their carriage miss was her feelings in on elizabeth s person behaviour and dress but would not join her her brother s recommendation was enough to her favour his judgment could not and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth as to leave without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable when returned to the saloon miss could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister how very ill looks this morning mr she cried i never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter she is grown so brown and coarse and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again however little mr might have liked such an address he contented himself with coolly replying that he no other alteration than her being rather â no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer pride and â for my own part she rejoined i confess that i never could see any in her her face is too thin her complexion has no brilliancy and her features are not at all handsome her nose wants character there is nothing marked in its lines her teeth are tolerable but not out of the common way and as for her eyes which have sometimes been called so fine i never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them they have a look which i do not like at all and in her air altogether there is a self without fashion which is intolerable persuaded as miss was that admired elizabeth this was not the best method of herself but angry people are not always wise and in seeing him at last look somewhat she had all the success she expected he was resolutely silent however and from a determination of making him speak she con â â remember when we first knew her in how amazed we all were to find that she was a beauty and i particularly recollect your saying one night after they had been dining at she a beauty i should as soon call her mother a wit but afterwards she seemed to improve on you and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time yes replied who could contain himself no longer but that was only when i first knew her for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the women of my acquaintance he then went away and miss was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself mrs and elizabeth talked of all that had oc during their visit as they returned except what had particularly interested them both the looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention they talked of his sister his friends his house his of every thing but himself yet elizabeth was longing to know aud prejudice mrs thought of him and mrs would have been gratified by her niece b the subject chapter xiii had been a good deal disappointed in not find a letter from jane on their first arrival at and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there but on the third her was over and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at on one of which was marked that it had been mis sent elsewhere elizabeth was not surprised at it as jane had written the direction remarkably ill they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in and her uncle and aunt leaving her to them in quiet set off by themselves the one mis sent must be first to it had been written five days ago the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements with such news as the country afforded but the latter half which was dated a day later and written in evident agitation gave more important it was to this effect â since writing the above dearest something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature but i am afraid of alarming you â be assured that we are all well what i have to say relates to poor an express came at twelve last night just as we were all gone to bed from colonel to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with

21,servant therefore she him though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible to fetch his master and mistress home instantly on his the room she sat down unable to support herself and looking so miserably ill that it was impossible for to leave her or to refrain from saying in a tone of gentleness and let me call your maid is there nothing you could take to give you present relief a glass of wine shall i get you one you are very iu no i thank you she replied endeavouring to recover herself there is nothing the matter with me i am quite well i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from she burst into tears as she alluded to it and for a few minutes could not speak another word in wretched suspense could only say something of his con and and observe her in at she spoke again i have just had a letter from with such dreadful news it cannot be concealed from any one my youngest sister has left all her friends â has has thrown herself into the power of â of mr they are gone off together from you know him too well to doubt the rest she has no money no nothing that can tempt him to â she is lost for ever was fixed in astonishment when i consider she added in a yet more agitated voice that might have prevented it who knew what he was had i but explained some part of it only â some part of what i learnt to my own family had his character been known this could not have happened but it is all all too late now i am grieved indeed cried grieved â shocked but is it certain absolutely certain oh yes they left together on sunday night and were traced almost to london but not beyond they are certainly not gone to scotland and what has been done what has been attempted to recover her my father is gone to london and jane has written to beg my uncle s immediate assistance and we shall be off i hope in half an hour nothing can be done i know very well that nothing can be done how is such a man to be worked on how are they even to be discovered i have not the smallest hope it is every way horrible shook his head in silent acquiescence when my eyes were open to his real character oh had i known what i ought what i dared to do but i knew not â i was afraid of doing too much wretched wretched mistake made no answer he seemed scarcely to hear her and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation his brow contracted his air gloomy â soon observed and instantly understood it her power was sinking every thing must sink under such a proof of family weakness such an assurance of the deepest disgrace pride and she neither wonder nor condemn hut the of his self conquest t nothing to her afforded no of her distress it was on the con exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes and never had she so honestly felt that she could loved him as now when all love must he vain but self though it would intrude could not her â the humiliation the misery she was on them all â soon swallowed up every private care and covering her face with her handkerchief was soon lost to every thing else and after a pause of several minutes was only recalled to a sense of her situation hy the voice of her companion who in a manner which though it spoke compassion spoke likewise restraint said i am afraid you have heen long desiring my absence nor have i any thing to plead in excuse of my stay hut real though concern would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress but i will not torment you with vain wishes which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks this unfortunate affair will i fear pre tent my sister s having the pleasure of seeing you at to day oh yes be so kind as to for us to miss say that urgent business calls us home immediately conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible i know it cannot be long he readily assured her of his secrecy again expressed his sorrow for her distress wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope and leaving his compliments for her relations with only one serious parting look went away as he quitted the room elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in and as she threw a glance over the whole of their acquaintance so full of and varieties sighed at the of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination pride and if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection elizabeth s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor but if otherwise if the regard springing from sources is unreasonable or unnatural in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object and even before two words have been exchanged nothing can be said in her defence except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for and that its ill success might perhaps her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment be that as it may she saw him go with regret and in this early example of what e must produce found additional anguish as she reflected on that 
21,wretched business never since reading jane s second letter had she entertained a hope of s meaning to marry her no one but jane she thought could flatter herself with such an expectation surprise was the least of all her feelings on this while the contents of the first letter remained on her mind she was all surprise all astonishment that should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money and how could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible but now it was all too for such an attachment as this she might have charms and though she did not suppose to be deliberately engaging in an without the intention marriage she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey she had never perceived while the regiment was in that had any partiality him but she was convinced that had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body sometimes one officer sometimes another had been her favourite as their attentions raised them in her opinion her had been continually but never without an object the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a oh how did she now feel it she was wild to be at home â to hear to see to be upon the spot to share with jane in the cares that must now pride and prejudice fall wholly upon her in a family so a father absent a mother incapable of exertion and requiring constant attendance and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for her uncle s interference seemed of the utmost importance and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience was severe mr and mrs had hurried back in alarm supposing by the servant s account that their niece was taken suddenly ill but satisfying them instantly on that head she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons reading the two letters aloud and dwelling on the of the last with trembling energy though had never been a favourite with them ir and mrs could not but be deeply afflicted not only but all were in it and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror mr readily promised every assistance in his power elizabeth though expecting no less thanked him with tears of gratitude and all three being by one spirit every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled they were to be off as soon as possible â but what is to be done about cried mrs john told us mr was here when you sent for us â was it so yes and i told him we should not be able to keep our that is all settled m is all settled repeated the other as she ran into her room to prepare and are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth oh that i knew how it was but wishes were vain or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself but she had her share of business as well as her aunt and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at with false excuses for their sudden departure an hour however saw the whole completed and mr meanwhile having settled his account at the inn nothing remained to be done but to go and elizabeth after au r and prejudice the misery of the morning found herself in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed seated in the carriage and on the road to chapter xiv i have been thinking it over again elizabeth said her uncle as they drove from the town and really upon serious consideration i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means or and who was actually staying in his colonel s family that i am strongly to hope the best could he expect that her friends would not step forward could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment after such an ont to colonel his temptation is not adequate to the risk do you really think so cried elizabeth brightening up for a moment upon my word said mrs i begin to be of your uncle s opinion it is really too great a of decency honour and interest for him to be guilty of it i cannot think so very ill of can you yourself ao wholly give him up as to him capable of it not perhaps of his own interest but of every other neglect i can believe him capable if indeed it should be so but i dare not hope it why should they not go on to scotland if that had been the case in the first place replied mr there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to scotland oh but their removing from the chaise into a coach is such a presumption and besides no traces of them were to be found on the road well then â supposing them to be in london they may be there though for the purpose of concealment for pride and prejudice no more purpose it is that money should be very abundant on either side and it might strike them that they could be more though less married in london than in scotland but why all tliis secrecy why any fear of detection why must their marriage be private oh no no this is not likely his most particular friend you see by jane account was persuaded of his never intending 
22,to marry her will never marry a woman without some money he cannot afford it and what claims has what attractions has she beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake forego every chance of himself by marrying well as to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a with her i am not able to judge for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce but as to your other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good has no brothers to step forward and he might imagine from my father s behaviour from his and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that he would do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in such a matter but can you think that is so lost to every thing but love of him as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage it does seem and it is most shocking indeed replied with tears in her eyes that a sister s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt but really i know not what to say perhaps i am not doing her justice but she is very young she has never been taught to think on serious subjects and for the last half year nay for a she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity she h s been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way since the â â â were first in nothing but love and officers have been in her head she has been doing every thing in her pride and prejudice power by thinking and talking on the subject to give what shall i call it to her feelings which are naturally lively enough and we all know that has every charm of person and address that can a woman but you see that jane said her aunt does not think so ill of as to believe him capable of the attempt of whom does jane ever think ill and who is there whatever might be their former conduct that she would believe capable of such an attempt till it were proved against them but jane knows as well as i do what really is we both know that he has been in every sense of the word that he has neither integrity nor honour that he is as false and as he is and do you really know all this cried mrs whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive â i do indeed replied elizabeth colouring i told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to mr and you yourself when last at heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him and there are other circumstances which i am not at liberty â which it is not worth while to relate but his lies about the whole family are endless from what he said of miss i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud reserved disagreeable girl yet he knew to the contrary himself he must know that she was as amiable and as we have found her but does know nothing of this can she be ignorant of what vou and jane seem so well to under stand oh yes â that that is the worst of all till i was in and saw so both of mr and his tion colonel i was ignorant of the truth my self and when i returned home the was to leave in a week or fortnight s time as that was the case neither jane to whom i related the whole i s hot i thought it necessary to make our knowledge public for of hat use could it apparently be to any one that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be and even when it was settled that should go with mrs the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to that she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head that such a consequence as this should you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts when they all removed to therefore you had ne reason i suppose to believe them fond of each other not the slightest i can remember no symptom of affection on either side and had any thing of the kind been perceptible you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away when first he entered the corps she was ready enough to admire him but so we all were every girl in or near was out of her senses about him for the first two months but he never distinguished her by any particular attention and consequently after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others of the regiment who treated her with more tion again became her it may be easily believed that however little of novelty could be added to their fears hopes and conjectures on this interesting subject by its repeated jn no other could detain them from it long during the whole of the journey fr m elizabeth s thoughts it was never absent fixed there by the keenest of all anguish self reproach she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness they travelled as as possible and sleeping one night on the road reached by the next day it was a comfort to elizabeth to con that jane could not have been wearied by long ex the little attracted by the sight of a chaise 
22,were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the and when the carriage drove up to the b s and door e joyful surprise that lighted up their faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies in a variety of and was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome elizabeth jumped out and after giving each of them a hasty kiss hurried into the where jane who running down stairs from her mother s immediately met her elizabeth as she affectionately embraced her whilst tears filled the eyes of both lost not a moment in asking whether any had been heard of the not yet replied jane but now that my dear uncle is come i hope every thing wiu be well is my father in town yes he went on tuesday as i wrote you word and have you heard from him often we have heard only once he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say he had arrived in safety and to give me his directions which i particularly begged him to do he merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention and my mother â how is she how are you all my mother is tolerably weu i trust though her spirits are greatly shaken she is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all she does not yet leave her dressing room mary and thank heaven are quite well but you â how are you cried elizabeth you look pale how much you must have gone through her sister however assured her of her being perfectly well and their conversation which had been passing mr and mrs were engaged with their was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party jane ran to her and aunt and welcomed and thanked them both with alternate smiles and tears when they were all in the drawing room the questions which elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others and they soon found that jane had no to give the sanguine hope of good however which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet pride and prejudice deserted her she still expected that it would all end well and that every morning would some letter either from or her father to explain their proceedings and perhaps announce the marriage mrs to whose apartment they all repaired after a few minutes conversation together received exactly as might be expected with tears and of regret against the conduct of ham and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her ter must be principally owing if i had been able said she to carry my point in going to with all my family this would not have happened but poor dear had nobody to take care of her why the ever let her go out of their sight i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well after i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her but i was over ruled as t always am poor dear child and now here s mr gone away and i know he will fight wherever he meets him and then he will be killed and what is to become of us all the will turn us out before he is cold in his grave and if you are not kind to us brother i do not know what we shall do they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas and mr after general assurances of his for her and all her family told her that he meant to be in london the very next day and would assist mr in every endeavour for recovering do not give way to useless alarm added he though it is t to be pr for the worst there is no occasion to look on it as certain it is not quite a week since they left in a few days more we may gain some news of them and till we know that they are not married and have no design of marrying do not let us give the matter over as lost as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother and make him come home with me to pride and street and then we may consult together as to what is to he done oh my dear brother replied mrs that is exactly what i could most wish for and now do when you get to town find them out wherever they may be and if they are not married already make them marry and as for wedding clothes do not let them wait for that but tell she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them after they are married and above all things keep mr from fighting tell him what a dreadful state i am in â that i am frightened out of my wits and have such such all over me such in my side and pains in my head and such at heart that i can get no rest by night nor by day and tell my dear not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me for she not know which are the best oh brother how kind you are i know you will contrive it all but mr though he assured her again of his earnest in the cause could not avoid moderation to her as well in her hopes as her fears and after talking with her in this manner till din ner was on table they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper who attended in the absence of her daughters 
22,though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family they did not attempt to oppose it for they knew that she had not prudence â enough to hold her tongue before the servants while they waited at table and judged it better that one only of the household and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject in the dining room they were soon joined by mary and who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before one came from her books and the other from her the faces of both however were tolerably calm and no change was visible in either except that the loss of her favourite sister or the anger which she had herself pride and in the business had given something more of fret fulness than usual to the accents of as for mary she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection soon after they were seated at table â this is a most unfortunate affair and will probably be much talked of but we must stem the tide of malice and pour into the wounded of each other the of consolation then perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying she added unhappy as the event must be for we may draw from it this useful lesson â that loss of virtue in a female is that one false step her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less than it is beautiful and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the of the other sex elizabeth lifted lip her eyes in amazement but was too much oppressed to make any reply mary however â to console herself with such kind of moral extract tions from the evil before them in the afternoon the two elder miss were able to be for half an hour by themselves and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making any which jane was equally eager to satisfy after joining in general over the dreadful of this event which elizabeth considered as all but certain and miss could not assert to be wholly the former continued the subject by saying but tell me all and every thing about it which have not already heard give me further particulars what did colonel say had they no apprehension of any thing before the took place they must have seen them together for ever colonel did own that he had often suspected some especially on s side but nothing to give him any alarm i am so grieved for him his be was attentive and kind to the utmost he was coming to us in order to assure us of his concern before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland that apprehension first got abroad it hastened his journey and and was convinced that would not marry did he know of their intending to go off had colonel seen himself yes hut when questioned by him denied knowing any thing of plan and would not give his real opinion about it he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from that i am inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before and till colonel came himself not one of you entertained a doubt i suppose of their being really married how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains i felt a little uneasy â a little fearful of my sister s happiness with him in marriage because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right my father and mother knew nothing of that they only felt how a match it must be then owned with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us that in s last letter she had prepared her for such a step she had known it seems of their being in love with each other many weeks but not before they went to â no i not and did colonel appear to think ill of ham himself does he know his real character i must confess that he did not speak so well of as he formerly did he believed him to be and extravagant and since this sad affair has taken place it is said ih i he left greatly in debt but i hope this may be false oh jane had we been less secret had we told what we knew of him this could not have happened perhaps it would have been better replied her sister but to expose tlie former faults of any person without what their present feelings were seemed we acted with the best intentions could colonel repeat the particulars of s note to his wife he brought it with him for us to see jane then took it from her pocket book and gave it to these were t ie â e and prejudice my dear you will laugh when you know where i am gone and i cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to morrow morning as soon as i am missed j am going to green and if you cannot guess with who i shall think you a for there is but one man in the world i love and he is an angel i should never be happy without him so think it no harm to be off you need not send them word at of my going if you do not like it for it will make the surprise the greater when i write to them and sign my name what a good joke it will be i can hardly write for laughing pray make my excuses to for not keeping my en and dancing with him to night tell him i hope he will excuse me when 
22,he knows all and teu him i will dance with him at the next ball we meet with great pleasure j shall send for my clothes when i get to but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up good by give my love to colonel i hope you will drink to our good journey your affectionate friend l oh thoughtless thoughtless cried elizabeth when she had finished it what a letter is this to be written at such a moment but at least it shows that she was serious in the object of her journey whatever he might afterwards persuade her to it was not on her side a scheme of my poor father how he must have felt it i never saw any one so shocked he could not speak a word for full ten minutes my mother was taken ill immediately and the whole house in such confusion oh jane cried elizabeth was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day i do not know i hope there was but to be guarded at such a time is very difficult my mother was in and though i endeavoured to give her every pride and assistance in my power i am afraid i did not do so much as might have done but the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties your attendance upon her has been too much for you you do not look well oh that i had been with you i you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself mary and have been very kind and would have shared in every fatigue i am sure but i did not think it right for either of them is slight and delicate and mary studies so much that her hours of repose should not be broken in on my aunt came to on tuesday after my father went away and was so good as to stay till thursday with me she was of great use and comfort to us all and lady has been very kind she walked here on wednesday morning to with us and offered her services or any of her daughters if could be of use to us she had better have stayed at home cried elizabeth perhaps she meant well but under such a misfortune as this one cannot see too little of one s neighbours assistance is impossible let them triumph over us at a distance and be satisfied she then proceeded to into the measures which her father had intended to pursue while in town for thâ j recovery of his daughter he meant i believe replied jane to go to the place where they last changed horses see the and try if any thing could be made out from them principal object must be to discover the number of the coach which took them from it had come with a fare from london and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and lady s removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make at if he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare he determined to make there and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach i do not know of any other designs that he had formed but he was in such a hurry to be gone and his greatly that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as pride a n chapter xv the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr the next mornings but the post came in without bringing a single line from him his family knew him to be on all common occasions a most and correspondent but at such a time they had hoped for exertion they were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing in to send but even of that they would have been glad to be certain mr had waited only for the letters before he set off when he was gone they were certain at least of ing constant information of what was going on and their uncle promised at to prevail on mr to return to as soon as he could to the great consolation of his sister who considered it as the only security for her husband s not being killed in a mrs and the children were to remain in a few days longer as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her she shared in their attendance on mrs and was a great com fort to them in their hours of freedom their other aunt also visited them frequently and always as she said with the design of cheering and them up though as she never came without some fresh instance of s extravagance or she seldom went away without leaving them more than she found them au seemed striving to the man who but three months before had been almost an angel of light he was declared to be in debt to every in the place and his all honoured with the title of se had been extended into every s family every body declared that he was the young man in the world and every body began to find out that they had always the appearance of his goodness elizabeth though she did not credit above half of what was said believed enough to make her former assurance of s pride a n her sister s ruin still more certain and even jane who believed still less of it became almost hopeless more especially as the time was now come when if they had gone to scotland which she had never before entirely of they must in all probability have gained some news of them 
23,mr left on sunday on tuesday his wife received a letter from him it told them that on his arrival he had immediately found out his brother and persuaded him to come to street that mr had been to â p om and before his â but without gaining any satisfactory information and that he was now determined to at all the hotels in town as mr thought it possible they might have gone to one of them on their first coming to london before they procured lodgings mr himself did not expect any success from this measure but as his brother was eager in it he meant to assist in pursuing it he added that mr seemed wholly at present to leave london and promised to write again very soon there was also a to this effect â i have written to colonel to desire him to find out if possible from some of the young man s in the regiment whether has any relations or con who would be to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself if there were any one that one could apply to with a probability of such a clue as that it might be of essential consequence at present we have nothing to guide us colonel wiu i dare say do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head but on second thoughts perhaps could tell us what relations he has now living better than any other person elizabeth at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded but it was not in her power to give any of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved she had never heard of his having had any relations except a father and mother both of whom had been dead pride and prejudice many years it was possible however that some of his companions in the might be able to give more information and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it the application was a something to look forward to every day at was now a day of anxiety but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected the arrival of letters was the first grand object of every morning s impatience through letters whatever of good or bad was to be told would be and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance but before they heard again from mr a letter arrived for their father from a different quarter from mr which as jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence she accordingly read and elizabeth who knew what his letters were looked over her and read it likewise it was as follows â my dear sir i feel myself called upon by our relationship and my situation in life to with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from be assured my dear sir that mrs and myself sincerely with you and all your respectable family in your present distress which must be of the bitterest kind because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove no arguments shall be wanting on my part that can so severe a misfortune or that may comfort you under a circumstance that must be of all others most to a parent s mind the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this and it is the more to be lamented because there is reason to suppose as my dear me that this ness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a degree of indulgence though at the same time for the consolation of yourself and mrs i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad or pride and prejudice could not be guilty of such an at so early an age that may be you are to be pitied in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs but likewise by lady and her daughter to whom i have related the affair they agree with in that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others for who as lady herself says will connect them selves with such a family and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with satisfaction on a certain event of last november for had it been otherwise i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace let me advise you then my dear sir to console yourself as much as possible to throw off your unworthy from your affection for ever and leave her to reap the fruits of her own offence i am dear sir c c mr did not write again till he had received an answer from colonel and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send it was not known that liad a single relation with whom he kept up any connection and it was certain that he had no near one living his former acquaintance had been numerous but since he had been in the it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them there was no one therefore who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him and in die wretched state of his own there was a very powerful motive for se in addition to bis fear of discovery by s relations for it had just that he had left debts behind him to a very considerable amount colonel believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at he owed a good deal in the town but his debts of honour were still more formidable mr did not attempt to con these particulars from the family jane heard them with horror a she cried 
23,this is wholly unexpected i had not an idea of it mr added in his letter that they might expect pride and prejudice to see their father at home on the following day which saturday rendered hy the ill success of all their he had yielded to his brother in law s entreaty that he would return to his family and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to he advisable for continuing their pursuit when mrs was told of this she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected considering what her anxiety for his life had been before what is he coming home and without poor she cried sure he will not leave london before he has found them who is to fight and make him marry her if he comes away as mrs began to wish to be at home it was that she and her children should go to london at the same time that mr came from it the coach therefore took them the first stage of their journey and brought its master back to mrs went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her friend that had attended her from that part of the world his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece and the kind of half expectation which mrs had formed of their being followed by a letter from him had ended in nothing elizabeth had received none since her return that could come from the present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the of her spirits unnecessary nothing therefore could be fairly from that though elizabeth who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings was perfectly aware that had she known nothing of she could have borne the dread of s somewhat better it would have spared her she thought one sleepless night out of two when mr arrived he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure he said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying made no mention of the business that had taken him away and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it it was not till the afternoon when he joined them at s pride and prejudice tea that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject and then on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured he replied say nothing of that who should suffer but myself it has been my own doing and i ought to feel it you must not be too severe upon yourself elizabeth you may well warn me against such an evil human nature is so prone to fall into it no let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression it will pass away soon enough do you suppose them to be in london yes where else can be so well concealed and used to want to go to london added she is happy then said her father and her residence there will probably be of some duration then after a short silence he continued i bear you no ill will for being justified in your advice to me last may which considering the event shows some greatness of mind they were interrupted by miss who came to fetch her mother s tea this is a parade cried he which does one good it gives such an elegance to misfortune another day i will do the same i will sit in my library in and gown and give as much trouble as i can â or perhaps i may it till runs away i am not going to run away papa said if should ever go to i would behave better than you go to i would not trust you so it as east for fifty pounds no i have at last learnt to be cautious and you will feel the effects of it no officer is ever to enter my house again nor even to pass through the village balls will be unless you stand up with one of your sisters and you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner and j l who took all these threats in a serious lights began to cry well well said he do not make yourself unhappy if you are a good girl for the next ten years i will take you to a review at the end of them chapter xvi two days after mr s return as jane and elizabeth were walking together in the behind the house they saw the housekeeper coming towards them and concluding that she came to call them to their mother went forward to meet her but instead of the expected summons when they approached her she said to miss i beg your pardon madam for interrupting you but i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town so i took the liberty of coming to ask what do you mean hill we have heard nothing from town dear madam cried mrs hill in great astonish ment don t you know there is an express come for master from mr he has been here this half hour and master has had a letter away ran the girls too eager to get in to have time for speech they ran through the into the breakfast room from thence to the library â their father was in neither and they were on the point of him up stairs with their mother when they were met by the butler who said â if you are looking for my master ma a i he is walking towards the little upon this information they instantly passed through the hall once more and 
23,ran across the lawn after their father who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the s c pride and jane who was not so nor so much in the of running as elizabeth soon behind while her sister panting for breath came up with him and eagerly cried out â oh papa what news what news have you heard from my uncle yes i have had a letter from him by express well and what news does it bring â good or bad what is there of good to be expected said he taking the letter from his pocket but perhaps you would like to read it elizabeth caught it from his hand jane now came up read it aloud said their father for i hardly know myself what it is about street monday august my dear brother at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece and such as upon the whole i hope will give you satisfaction soon after you left me on saturday i was enough to find out in what part of london they were the particulars i reserve till we meet it is enough to know they are discovered i have seen them both then it is as i always hoped cried jane they are married elizabeth read on i have seen them both they are not married nor can i find there was any intention of being so but if you are willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on your side i hope it will not be long they are all that is required of you is to assure to your daughter by settlement her equal of the five thousand pounds secured among your children after the of yourself and my sister and moreover to enter into an engagement of allowing her during your life one hundred pounds per these are conditions which considering every thing i had no hesitation in with as far as i thought myself privileged for you i shall send this by express that na time may be lost in bringing me your answer you will pride and q comprehend from these particulars that mr ham s circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to he the world has been deceived in that respect and i am happy to say there will be some little money even when au his debts are discharged to settle on my niece in addition to her own fortune if as i con wiu be the case you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business i will immediately give directions to for preparing a proper settlement there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again therefore stay quietly at and depend on my diligence and care send back your answer as soon as you can and be careful to write we have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house of which i hope you will approve she comes to us to day i shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on c is it possible cried elizabeth when she had finished can it be possible that he will marry her is not so then as we have thought him said her sister my dear father i con v you and have you answered the letter said elizabeth no but it must be done soon most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he wrote oh my dear father she cried come back and write immediately consider how important every ment is in such a case let me write for you said jane if you dislike the trouble yourself i it very much he but it must be done and so saying he turned back with them and walked towards the house and may i ask said elizabeth but the terms i must be complied with pride and prejudice â â complied with i am only ashamed of his asking lo and they marry yet he is a man yes yes they must marry there is nothing else to he done but there are two things that i want very much to know â one is how much money your has laid down to it and the other how i am ever to pay him money my uncle cried jane what da you sir i mean that no man in his senses would marry on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life and fifty after i am gone that is very true said though it had not occurred to me his to he discharged and something still to remain oh it must he my uncle s doings good man i am afraid he has distressed a small sum could not do all this â no said her father s a fool if he takes her with a less than ten thousand pounds should he sorry to think so ill of him in the very h n of our relationship ten thousand pounds heaven forbid how is half a sum to he repaid mr made no answer and each of them deep in thought continued silent till they reached the house their father then went to the library to write and the girls walked into the breakfast room and they are really to be married i cried as soon as they were by themselves how strange this is and for this we are to be thankful that they should marry small as is their chance of happiness and wretched as is his character we are forced to rejoice oh i comfort myself with thinking replied jane that he certainly would not marry if he had not a real regard for her though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him i cannot believe that ten thousand 
23,pounds or any thing like it has been advanced pride ann prejudice he has children of his own and may have more how could he spare half ten thousand pounds if we are ever able to learn what s debts have been said elizabeth and how much is settled on his side on our sister we shall exactly know what mr has done for them because has not of his own the kindness of my uncle and can never be their taking her home and af her their personal protection and countenance is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude can not enough acknowledge by this time she is actually with them if such goodness does not make her miserable now she will never deserve to be happy what a meeting for her when she first sees my aunt we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side said jane i hope and trust they will yet be happy his to marry her is a proof i will believe that he is come to a right way of thinking their mutual affection will steady them and i flatter myself they will settle so quietly and live in so rational a manner as may in time make their past forgotten their conduct has been such replied elizabeth as neither you nor i nor any body can ever forget it is useless to talk of it it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all perfectly ignorant of what had happened they went to the library therefore and asked their father whether he would not wish em to make it known to her he was writing and without raising his head coolly replied â just as you please â may we take my uncle s letter to read to her take whatever you like and get away elizabeth took the letter from his writing table and they went up stairs together mary and were both mrs one communication would therefore do for all after a slight preparation for good news the letter was read aloud mrs could hardly contain herself as soon as jane had read mr s hope of s being soon married her joy burst forth and every s and prejudice following sentence added to its she was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she had ever been from alarm and vexation to know that her daughter would be married was enough she was disturbed by no fear for her felicity nor by any remembrance of her my dear dear she cried this is delightful indeed she will be married i shall see her again she will be married at sixteen i my good kind brother i knew how it would be â i knew he would manage every thing how i long to see her and to see dear too but the clothes the wedding clothes f i will write to my sister about them directly my dear run down to your father and ask him how much he will give her stay stay i will go myself ring the bell for hill i will put on my things in a moment my dear dear how merry we shall be together when we meet her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some to the violence of these by leading her thoughts to the obligations which mr s behaviour laid them all under for we must attribute this happy conclusion she added in a great measure to his kindness we are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist mr ham with money well cried her mother it is all very right who should do it but her own if he had not had a family of his own i and my children must have had all his money you know and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him except a few presents well i am so happy in a short time i shall have a daughter married mrs how well it sounds and she was only sixteen last june my dear jane i m in such a flutter that i am sure i can t write so i dictate and you write for me we will settle with your father about the money afterwards but the things should be ordered immediately she was then proceeding to all the particulars of muslin and and would shortly have dictated a â and prejudice very plentiful orders had not jane though with some persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted one day s delay she observed would be of small importance and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as other schemes too came into her head i will go to said she as soon as i am dressed and tell the good good news to my sister and as i come back i can call on lady and mrs long run down and order the carriage an would do me a great deal of good i am sure girls can i do any thing for you in oh here comes hill my dear hill have you heard the good news miss is going to be married and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding mrs hill began instantly to express her joy elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest and then sick of this took refuge in her own room that she might think freedom poor s situation must at best be bad enough but that it was no worse she had need to be thankful she felt it so and in look ing forward neither rational happiness nor worldly could be expected for her sister in looking back to what they had feared only two hours ago she felt all the advantages of what they had gained chapter xvi l mr had very often wished before this 
24,period of his life that instead of spending his whole income he had laid by an annual sum for the better provision of his children and of his wife if she survived him he now wished it more than ever had he done his duty in that respect need not have been indebted to her for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the s pride and prejudice worthless young men in great britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little ad to any one should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother in law and he was determined if possible to find out the extent of his assistance and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could when first mr had married economy was held to be perfectly useless for of course they were to have a son this son was to join in cutting off the as soon as he should be of age and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for five daughters entered the world but yet the son was to come and mrs for many years after s birth had been certain that he would this event had at last been of but it was then too late to be saving mrs had no turn for economy and her husband s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs and the children but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents this was one point with to at least which was now to be settled and mr could have no hesitation in to the proposal before him in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother though expressed most he then on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done and his to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him he had never before supposed that could be prevailed on to marry his daughter it would be done with so uttle inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement he would scarcely be ten pounds a year the by the that was to be paid them for what with her board and pocket allowance and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mother s hands s expenses had been very uttle within that sum that it would be done with such trifling exertion on hit side too was another very welcome surprise for his chief pride and prejudice wish at present was to have as little trouble in the ness as possible when the first of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over he naturally returned to all his former his letter was soon despatched for though in undertaking business he was quick in its he begged to know further particulars of what he was indebted to his brother but was too angry with to send any sage to her the good news quickly spread through the house and with speed through the neighbourhood it was borne in the latter witli decent philosophy to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had miss come upon the town or as the happiest alternative been secluded from the world in some distant farm house but there was much to be talked of in marrying her and the good natured wishes for her well doing which had proceeded before from all the old ladies in lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances because with such a husband her misery was considered certain it was a fortnight since mrs had been down stairs but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table and in spirits high no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph the marriage of a daughter which had been the first object of her wishes since jane was sixteen was now on the point of accomplishment and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant fine new carriages and servants she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter and without knowing or considering what their income might be rejected many as deficient in size and importance haye park might do said she if the would quit it or the great house at if the were larger but is too far off i could not bear to have her ten miles from me and as for lodge the are dreadful pride and her allowed her to talk on without while the servants remained but when they had withdrawn he said to her mrs before you tale any or all of these houses for your son and daughter let us to a right understanding into one house in this neighbourhood they shall never have i will not encourage the of either by receiving them at a long dispute followed this declaration but mr was firm it soon led to another and mrs found with amazement and horror that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion mrs could hardly comprehend it that his anger could he carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem exceeded all that she could believe possible she was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new clothes must reflect on her ter s than to any sense of shame at her and living with a fortnight before they took place elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had from 
24,the distress of the moment been led to make mr acquainted with their fears for her sister for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the they might hope to conceal its able beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot she had no fear of its spreading farther through his means there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sister s would have her so much not however from any fear of disadvantage from it to herself for at any rate there seemed a gulf between them had s marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms it was not to be supposed that mr pride and prejudice would connect himself with a family where to every other objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned from such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink the wish of her regard which she had assured herself of his feeling in could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this she was she was grieved she repented though she hardly knew of what she became jealous of his esteem when she could no longer hope to be by it she wanted to hear of him when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence she was convinced that she could have been happy with him when it was no longer likely they should meet what a triumph for him as she often thought could he know that the proposals which she had proudly only four months ago would now have been gladly and gratefully received he was as generous she doubted not as the most generous of his sex but while he was mortal there must be a triumph she began now to that he was exactly the man who in disposition and talents would most suit her his understanding and temper though unlike her own would have answered all her wishes it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both by her ease and his mind might have been softened his manners improved and from his judgment information and knowledge of the world she must have received benefit of greater importance but no such happy marriage could now teach the ing multitude what felicity really was an union of a different tendency and the possibility of the other was soon to be formed in their family how and were to be supported in to independence she could not imagine but how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions stronger than their virtue she could easily conjecture pride and prejudice mr soon wrote again to his brother to mr he briefly replied with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family and concluded with entreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again the principal purport of his letter was to inform them that mr had resolved on the it was greatly my wish that he should do so he added as soon as his marriage was fixed on and i think you will agree with me in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable both on his account and my niece s it is mr s intention to go into the and among his former friends there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army he has the promise of an in general â â s regiment now in the north it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom he promises fairly and i hope among people where they may each have a character to preserve tliey will both be more prudent i have written to colonel to inform him of our present arrangements and to request that he will satisfy the various of mr in and near with assurances of speedy payment for which i have pledged myself and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his in of whom i shall a list according to his information he has given in all his debts i hope at least he has not deceived us has our directions and all will be completed in a week they will then join his regiment unless they are first invited to and i understand from mrs that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the south she is well and to be remembered to you and her mother â yours c e mr and his daughters saw all the advantages of s removal from the as clearly as mr could do but mrs was not so well and prejudice pleased with it s being settled in the north just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company for she had by no means given up her plan of their in was a severe disappoint ment and besides it was such a pity that ould be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body and had so many she is so fond of mrs said she it will be quite shocking to send her away and there are several of the young men too that she likes very much the officers may not be so pleasant in s regiment his daughter s request for such it might be considered of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the north received at first an absolute negative but jane and elizabeth who agreed in wishing for the sake of their sister s and consequence that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents urged him so earnestly yet so and so mildly to receive her and 
24,her husband at as soon as they were married that he was prevailed on to think as they thought and act as they wished and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she should be able to show her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the north when mr wrote again to his brother therefore he sent his permission for them to come and it was settled that as soon as the ceremony was over they should proceed to elizabeth was surprised however that should consent to such a scheme and had she consulted only her own inclination any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes chapter xviii their sister s wedding day arrived and jane and elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself the carriage was sent to meet them â and they t were to return in it by dinner time their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss and jane more especially who gave the fe which would have attended herself had she been the and was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure they came the family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive them smiles the face of mrs as the carriage drove up to the door her husband looked grave her daughters alarmed anxious uneasy s voice was heard in the the door was thrown open and she ran into the room her mother stepped forwards embraced her and welcomed her with rapture gave her hand with an affectionate smile to who followed his lady and wished them both joy with an alacrity which showed no doubt of their happiness their reception from mr to whom they then turned was not quite so cordial his countenance rather gained in and he scarcely opened his lips the easy assurance of the young couple indeed was enough to provoke him elizabeth was disgusted and even miss was shocked was still wild noisy and fearless she turned from sister to sister demanding their congratulations and when at length they all sat down looked eagerly round the room took notice of some little alteration in it and observed with a laugh that it was a great while since she had been there was not at all more distressed than herself his manners were always so pleasing that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought his smiles and his easy address while he claimed their relationship would have delighted them all elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance but she sat down within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man she blushed and jane blushed but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no of colour there was no want of discourse the bride and her mother could neither of them u k i â pride and prejudice ham who happened to sit near after his acquaintance in that with a ease which she felt very to equal in her replies they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world nothing of the past was with pain and led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world only think of its being three months she cried since i went away it seems but a fortnight i declare and yet there have been things enough happened in the time gracious when i went away i am sure i had no more idea of being married till i came back again though i thought it would be very good fun if i was her father lifted up his eyes jane was distressed elizabeth looked at but she who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible gaily continued oh mamma do the people know i am married to day i was afraid they might not and we overtook william in his so i was determined he should know it and so i let down the side glass next to him and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the window frame so that he might see the ring and then i bowed and smiled like any thing elizabeth could bear it no longer she got up and ran out of the room and returned no more till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour she then joined them soon enough to see with anxious parade walk up to her mother s right hand and hear her say to her eldest sister ah jane i take your place now and you must go lower because i am a married woman tt was not to be d that time would give that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first her ease and good spirits increased she longed to see mrs the and all their other neighbours and to hear herself called mrs by each of them and in the mean time she went after dinner to show her ring and boast of being married to mrs hill and the two t a s and well mamma said she when they were all returned to the and what do you think of my husband is not he a charming man i am sure my sisters must all envy me i only hope they may have half my good luck they must all go to that is the place to get husbands what a pity it is mamma we did not all go very true and if i had my will we should but my dear i don t at all like your such a way off must it be so oh lord yes there is nothing in that i shall like it of all things you and papa and my sisters must come down and see us we shall be at 
24,all the winter and i dare say there will be some balls and i will take care to get good partners for them all i should like it beyond any thing said her mother and then when you go away you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you and i dare say i shall get husbands for them before the winter is over i thank you for my share of the favour said elizabeth but i do not particularly like your way of getting husbands their were not to remain above ten days with them mr had received his commission before he left london and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight no one but mrs r that their stay be so short and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter and having very frequent parties at home these parties were acceptable to all to avoid a family was even mare desirable to such as did think than such as did not s aâ tion for was just what elizabeth had expected to find it not equal to s for him she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied from the reason of things that their had been brought on by the strength of her love rather than by his md she would have wondered why without violently caring for her he chose to x â k ax that his flight waa â si m a and if that were the case he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion was exceedingly fond of him â he was her dear on every occasion no one was to be put in competition with him he did every thing best in the world and e was sure he would kill more birds on the first of september than any body else in the country one mornings soon after their arrival as she was sitting with her two elder sisters she said to elizabeth â i never gave you an account of my i believe you were not by when i told mamma and the others all about it are not you curious to hear how it was managed no really replied elizabeth i think there cannot be too little said on the subject la you are so strange but i must you how it went off we were married you know at st s because s lodgings were in that parish and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven o clock my uncle and aunt and i were to go together and th others were to meet us at the church well monday morning came and i was in such a fuss i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off and i should have gone quite distracted and there waa my aunt all the time i was dressing preaching and talk ing away just as if she was reading a sermon however i did not hear above one word in ten for i was thinking you may suppose of my dear i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat well and so we at ten as usual i thought it would never be over for by the by you are to understand that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all ihe time i was with them if you ll believe me i did not once put my foot out of doors though i was there a fortnight not one party or scheme or any thing to be sure london was rather thin but however the little theatre was open well and so just as the carriage came to the door my was away u u es tie horrid man mr stone and s they get together there is no end oi x x x s pride and so frightened i did not know what to do for my uncle was to give away and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married au day but luckily he came back again in ten minutes time and then we all set out however i recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going the wedding need not be put off for mr might have done as well mr repeated elizabeth in utter ment oh yes he was to come there with you know but gracious me i quite forgot i i ought not to have said a word about it j promised them so faithfully what will say it was to be such a secret if it was to be a secret said say not another word on the subject you may depend upon my seeking io further oh certainly said elizabeth though burning with curiosity we will ask you no questions thank you said for if you did i should certainly tell you all and then would be so angry on such encouragement to ask elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power by running away but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible pr at least it was impossible not to try or information mr had been at her sister s wedding it was exactly a scene and exactly among people where he had apparently least to do and least temptation to go conjectures as to the meaning of it rapid and wild hurried into her brain but she was satisfied with none those that best pleased her as placing his conduct in the noblest light seemed most improbable she could not bear such suspense and hastily seizing a sheet of paper wrote a short letter to her aunt to request an explanation of what had dropped if it were with the secrecy which had been intended you may readily comprehend she added what my curiosity must be to know how a person with any of 
25,us and comparatively a stranger to our family f should have been x pride and prejudice s instantly and let tne understand it â unless it is for very reasons to remain in the secrecy which seems to think necessary and then i most endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance not that i shall though she added to herself and she finished the letter and my dear aunt if you do not tell me in an honourable manner i shall certainly be re to tricks and to find it out jane s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what had let fall elizabeth was glad of it till it appeared whether her would receive any she had rather be wi out a chapter xix elizabeth had the satisfaction of an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could she was no sooner in possession of it than hurrying into the little where she was least likely to be interrupted she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial street my dear niece i have just received your letter and shall devote this morning to answering it as i foresee that a little writing will not what i have to tell you i must confess myself surprised by application i did not expect it from you don t think me angry however for i only mean to let you know that t had not imagined such to be necessary on your side if you do not to understand me forgive my impertinence your is as much surprised as i am and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done but if you are really innocent and ignorant i must be more explicit on the very day of my coming home from your uncle had t â most unexpected mr called and was shut up with him several hours it was all over before i ar lived so my curiosity was not so dreadfully as seems to have been he came to tell mr that he had found out where your sister and mr were and that he had seen and talked with them both â repeatedly once from what i can collect he left only one day after ourselves and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that s had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him he generously the whole to his mistaken pride and confessed that he had before thought it him to lay his private actions open to the world his character was to speak for itself he called it therefore his d ty to step forward and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself if he had another motive i am sure it would never disgrace him he had been some days in town before he was able to discover them but he had something to direct his search which was more than had and the consciousness of this was another reason for his to follow us there is a lady it seems a mrs who was some time ago to miss and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of though he did not say what she then took a large house in edward street and since main herself by letting lodgings this mrs was he knew intimately acquainted with and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted she would not betray her trust i suppose without and corruption for she really did know where her friend was to be found indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in london and had she been to receive them into her house they would have taken up their abode with her at length however our kind friend procured the wished for direction they were in â â he saw and after pride and s wards insisted on seeing his first object with her be acknowledged had been to persuade her to quit her present situation and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her offering his assistance as far as it would go but he found absolutely resolved on remaining where she was she cared for none of her friends she wanted no help of his she would not hear of leaving she was sure they should be married some time â other and it did not much signify when since such were her feelings it only re he thought to secure and a marriage which in his very first conversation with he easily learnt had never been hu design he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour which were very pressing and not to lay all the ill consequences of s flight on her own folly alone he meant to resign his commission and as to his future situation he could con very little about it he must go somewhere but he did not know where and he knew he should have nothing to live on mr asked why he did not marry your sister at once though mr was not imagined to be very rich he would have been able to do something for him and his situation must have been by e but he found in reply to this question that still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country under such circumstances however he was not likely to be proof 
25,against the temptation of immediate relief they met several times for there was much to be discussed of course wanted more than he could get but at length was reduced to be reasonable every thing being settled between them mr a next step was to make your acquainted with it and he first called in graces church street the evening before i came home but mr could not be seen and mr found on ther that your father was still with him but would quit town the next morning he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consist at your and tho fore readily postponed him tiu â aim after the departure of the former he did not leave his name and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business on saturday he came again your father was gone your at home as i said be fore they had a great deal of talk together they met again on sunday and then saw him too it was not all settled before monday as soon as it express was sent off to but our was very obstinate i fancy obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all he has been accused of many faults at different times but this is the true one nothing was to be done that he did not do himself i am sure and i do not speak it to be therefore say nothing about it your uncle would most readily have settled the they it together for a long time which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved but at last your was forced to and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it which went against the grain and i really your letter this morning gave him great pleasure because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers and give the praise where it was due but this must go no than or jane at most you know pretty well i suppose what has been done for the young people his debts are to be paid i to considerably more than a pounds another thousand in addition to her own settled upon and his commission the reason why all thi â was to be done by him alone was such as i have given it was owing to him to his reserve and want of proper consideration that s had been â o misunderstood and consequently that he had been re tâ and noticed as he was perhaps there was some truth in this though i doubt whether his reserve or any s reserve can be for the event but in â of all this fine talking my dear you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have if we had not given credit for another interest in the â when all tl a was resolved on he again and si to his friends who were still staying at hut it was agreed that he should he in london once more the wedding took place and all money matters were then to receive the last finish i i have now told you every thing it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise i hope at least it not afford you any displeasure came to us and had constant admission to the house he was exactly what h had heen when i knew him in hut i would not tell you how uttle i was satisfied with her he while she staid with us if i had not perceived by jane s letter last wednesday that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it and therefore what i now tell you can give you no fresh pain i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner representing to her the wickedness of what she had done and all the she had on her family if she heard me it was by good luck for i am sure she did not i was sometimes quite provoked but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane and for their had patience with her mr was punctual in his return and as informed you attended the wedding he dined with us the next day and was to leave again on wednesday or thursday will you be very angry with me my dear if i take this opportunity of saying what i was never bold enough to say before how much i like him his behaviour to us has in every respect been as pleasing as when we were in his understanding and opinions all please me he wants thing but a little more and if he marry his wife may teach him i thought him very sly he hardly ever mentioned your name but seems the fashion pray forgive me if i have been very or at least do not punish me so far as to me from p i shall never be quite happy till i have all round the park a low with a nice little pair of would be the very thing but j must write no more the children have been wanting me this half hour yours very sincerely m â pride and the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr l might have been doing to forward her sister s match which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable and at the same time dreaded to be just from the pain of obligation were proved beyond their greatest extent to be 
25,true he had followed them purposely to town he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a in which had been necessary to a woman whom he must and despise and where he was reduced to meet frequently meet reason with persuade and finally bribe the man whom he always most wished to avoid and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem her heart did whisper that he had done it for her but it was a hope checked by other considerations and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient when required to depend on his for her for a woman who had already refused him as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as against relationship with law of every kind of pride must revolt from the connection he had to be sure done much she was ashamed to think how much but he had given a reason for his interference which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong he had liberality and he had the means of it and though she would not place herself as his principal she could perhaps believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned it was painful exceedingly painful to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return they owed the restoration of her character every thing to him oh how heartily did she grieve over every sensation she had ever encouraged every speech she had ever directed to and wards him for herself she was but she was proud of him â proud that in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better of himself she read over her aunt s of him again and again it was hardly enough but it pleased her she was even sensible of some pleasure though mixed with regret on finding how both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence between mr and herself she was roused from her seat and her reflections by some one approach and before she could strike into another path she was overtaken by i am afraid i interrupt your solitary my dear sister said he as he joined her you certainly do she replied with a smile but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome i should be sorry indeed if it were we were always good friends and now we are better true are the others coming out i do not know mrs and are going in the carriage to and so my dear sister i find from our uncle and aunt that you have seen she replied in the affirmative i almost envy you the pleasure and yet i believe it would be too much for me or else i could take it in my way to and you saw the old housekeeper i suppose poor she was always very fond of me but of course she did not mention my name to you yes she did and what did she say that you were gone into the army and she was afraid had â not turned out well at such a distance as that you know things are strangely certainly he replied biting his lips elizabeth hoped she had silenced him but he soon afterwards said â i was surprised to see in town last month we passed each other several times i wonder what he can be doing there perhaps preparing for his de sue my name lu you â na say r c s and said elizabeth it must be something particular to take him there at this time of year undoubtedly did you see him while you were at i thought i understood from the that you had yes he introduced us to his sister and do you like her very much i have heard indeed that she is uncommonly im proved within this year or two when i last saw her she was not very promising i am very you liked her i hope she will turn out well i dare say she will she has got over the most trying age did you go by the village of i do not recollect that we did i mention it because it is the living which i ought to have had a most delightful place excellent house it would have suited me in every respect how should you have liked making sermons exceedingly well i should have considered it as part of my duty and the exertion would soon have been nothing one ought not to but to be sure it would have been such a thing for me the quiet the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness but it was not to be did you ever hear mention the circumstance when you were in i have heard from authority which i thought as good that it was left you only and at the will of the present patron you have yes there was something in that i told you so from the first you may remember i did hear too that there was a time when was not so to you as it seems to be at present that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders and that the business had been accordingly you did and it was not wholly without foundation you may remember what i told you on that point when ni we talked of it pride and they were now almost at the door of the house for she had walked fast to get rid of him and unwilling for her sister s sake to provoke him she only said in reply with 
25,a good humoured smile â come mr we are brother and sister you know do not let us quarrel about the past in future i hope we shall be always of one mind she held out her hand he kissed it with affectionate gallantry though he hardly knew how to look and they entered the house chapter xx mr was so perfectly satisfied with this converse that he never again distressed himself or provoked his dear sister elizabeth by introducing the subject of it and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet the day of his and s departure soon came and mrs was forced to submit to a separation which as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to was likely to continue at least a oh my dear she cried when shall we meet again oh lord i don t know not these two or three years perhaps write to me very often my dear as often as i can but you know married women have never much time for writing my sisters may write to me they will have nothing else to do mr s were much more affectionate than his wife s he smiled looked handsome and said many pretty things he is as fine a fellow said mr as soon as they were out of the house as ever i saw he and and makes love to us i am proud pride and of him i defy even sir william himself to pro a more valuable son in law the loss of her daughter made mrs very dull for several days i often said she that there is nothing so bad as parting with one s friends one seems so forlorn without them this is the consequence you see madam of marrying a daughter said elizabeth it must make yoa better that your other four are single it is no such thing does not leave me because she is married but only because her husband s regiment happens to be so far oft if that had been nearer she would not have gone so soon but the condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope by an article of news which then began to be in circulation the housekeeper at had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master who was coming down in a day or two to shoot there for several weeks mrs was quite in the she looked at jane and smiled and shook her head by turns well well and so mr is coming down sister for mrs first brought her the news well so much the better not that i care about it though he is nothing to us you know and i am sure never want to see him again but however he is very welcome to come to if he likes it and who knows what may happen but that is nothing to us you know sister we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it and so it is quite certain he is coming you may depend on it replied the other for mrs was in last night i saw her passing by and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it and she told that it was certainly true he comes down on thursday at the latest very likely on wednesday she was going to the butcher s she told me on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed pride prejudice miss had not been able to hear of his coming changing colour it was many months since she had mentioned his name to elizabeth but now as soon as they were alone together she said â i saw you look at me to day when my aunt told us of the present report and i know i appeared distressed but don t imagine it was from any silly cause i was only confused for the moment because i felt that i should be looked at i do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain i am glad of one thing that he comes alone because we shall see the less of him not that i am afraid of myself ut i dread other people s remarks elizabeth did not know what to make of it had she not seen him in she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged but she still thought him partial to jane and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friend s permission or being bold enough to come without it yet it is hard she sometimes thought that this poor man cannot come to a house which he has hired without raising all this speculation i will leave bim to himself in spite of what her sister declared and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it they were more disturbed more unequal than she had often seen them the subject which had been so warmly their parents about a ago was now brought forward again as soon as ever mr comes my dear said mrs you will wait on him of course no no you forced me into visiting him last year and promised if i went to see him he should marry one of my daughters but it ended in nothing and i will not be sent on a errand again his wife represented to him how absolutely u pride and prejudice such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gen on his returning to t is an etiquette i despise said he 
26,if he wants our let him seek it he knows where we live i ill not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again well all i know is that it will be rude if you do not wait on him but however that shan t prevent my asking him to dine here i am determined we must have mrs long and the soon that will make with ourselves so there will be just room at table for him consoled by this resolution she was the better able to bear her husband s though it was very to know that her neighbours might all see mr in consequence of it before they did as the day of his arrival drew near â i begin to be sorry that he comes at all said jane to her sister it would be nothing i could see him with perfect indifference but can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of my mother means well but she does not know no one can know how much i suffer from what she says happy shall i be when his stay at is over i wish i could say any thing to comfort you elizabeth but it is wholly out of my power you must feel it and the usual satisfaction of preaching pa to a sufferer is denied me because you have always so much mr arrived mrs through the assistance of servants contrived to have the earliest tidings of it that the period of anxiety and on her side might be as long as it could she counted the days that must before their invitation could be sent hopeless of seeing him before but on the third morning after his arrival in she saw him from her dressing room window enter the and ride to wards the house her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy and prejudice jane resolutely kept her place at the table but elizabeth to satisfy her mother went to the window â she looked â be saw mr with him and sat down again by her sister there is a gentleman with him mamma said who can it be some acquaintance or other my dear i suppose i am sure i do not know la replied it looks just like that man that used to be him before mr what s his name â that proud man gracious mr â and so it does i vow well any friend of mr s will always be welcome here to be sure but else i must say that i hate the very sight of him jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern she knew but little of their meeting in and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister in seeing him almost for the first time after ing letter both sisters were uncomfortable enough each felt for the other and of course for selves and their mother talked on of her dislike of mr and her resolution to be civil to him only as mr s friend without being heard by either of them but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane to whom she had never yet had courage to show mrs s letter or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him to jane he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused and whose merits she had but to her own more extensive information he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits and whom she regarded herself with an interest if not quite so tender at least as reasonable and just as what jane felt for her astonishment at his coming â at his coming to to and seeking her again was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in the colour which had been drive n ii vâ st v n â u s pride and prejudice turned for half a minute with an additional glow and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still he hut she would not he secure let me first see how he said she it will then be early enough for expectation she sat intently at work striving to be composed and without daring to lift up her eyes till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door jane looked a little paler than usual but more than â had expected on the gentlemen s appearing her colour increased yet she received them with tolerable ease and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow and sat down again to her work with an eagerness which it did not often command she had ventured only one glance at he looked serious as usual and she thought more as he had been used to look in than as she had seen him at but perhaps he could not in her mother s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt it was a painful but not an improbable conjecture she had likewise seen for an instant and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed he was received by mrs with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed especially when contrasted with the cold and politeness of her courtesy and address of his friend elizabeth particularly who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied after of her how mr and mrs did a question which she could not answer without 
26,confusion said scarcely any thing he was not seated by her perhaps that was the reason of his silence but it had not been so in i v ss sâ l to her friends when lie co iv â x pride and prejudice several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice and when occasionally unable to resist the impulse of curiosity she raised her eyes to his face she as often found him looking at jane as at herself and frequently on no object but the ground more though and less anxiety to please than when they last met were plainly expressed she was disappointed and angry with herself for being so could i expect it to be otherwise said she yet why did he come she was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself and to him she had hardly courage to speak she after his sister but could do no more it is a long time mr since you went away said mrs he readily agreed to it i began to be afraid you would never come back again people did say you meant to quit the place entirely at but however i hope it is not true a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood since you went away miss is married and settled and one of my own daughters i suppose you have heard of it indeed you have seen it in the papers it was in the times and the i know though it was not put in as it ought to be it was only said lately george esq to miss without there being a syllable said of her father or the place where she lived or any thing it was my brother s drawing up too and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it did you see it replied that he did and made his elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes how mr looked therefore she could not tell it ia a delightful thing to be sure to have a daughter well married continued her mother but at the same time mr it is very hard to have her taken away from me they are gone down to a place quite northward it seems and there they are to stay i do not know how long his regiment is there for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the â and of his u being gone into the thank heaven he has friends though perhaps not so many as he deserves elizabeth who knew this to be at mr was in such misery of shame that she could hardly keep her seat it drew from her however the exertion of speaking which nothing else had so effectually done before and she asked whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present a few weeks he believed when you have killed all your own birds mr said her mother i beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on mr s i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you and will save all the best of the for you elizabeth s misery increased at such unnecessary such attention were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago every thing she was persuaded would be hastening to the same conclusion at that instant she felt that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion the first wish of my heart said she to herself is never more to be in company with either of them their society can afford no pleasure that will for such wretchedness as this let me never see either one or the other again yet the misery for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation received soon afterwards material relief from observing how much the beauty of her sister the admiration of her former lover when first he came in he had spoken to her but little but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention he found her as handsome as she had been last year as good natured and as unaffected though not quite so jane was anxious that no should be perceived in her at all and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever but her mind was so busily engaged that she did not always know when she was silent when the gentlemen rose to go away mrs wai and prejudice of her intended civility and they were invited and engaged to dine at in a few days time you are quite a visit in my debt mr she added for when you went to town last winter you promised to take a family dinner with us as soon as you returned i have not forgot you see and i assure you i was very much disappointed that you did not come hack and keep your engagement looked a little silly at reflection and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business they then went away mrs had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day but though she always kept a very good table she did not think any thing less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year chapter xxi as soon as they were gone elizabeth walked out to cover her spirits or in other words to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must hem mr s behaviour astonished and vexed her why if he came only to be silent grave and said she did he come at all she could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure he could be still 
26,amiable still pleasing to my uncle and aunt when he was in town and why not to me if he fears me why come hither if he no longer cares for me why silent man i will think no more about him her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister who joined her with a cheerful look which showed her better satisfied with their than elizabeth u q pride and now said she that this first meeting is over i feel perfectly easy i know my own strength and i shall never he embarrassed again by his coming i am glad he here on tuesday it will then be publicly seen that on both sides we met only as common and indifferent acquaintance yes very indifferent indeed said elizabeth â oh jane take care my dear you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now i think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday and mrs in the mean while was giving way to all the happy schemes which the good humour and common politeness of in half an hour s visit had revived on ay there was a large party assembled at and the two who were most anxiously expected to the credit of their as were in very good time when they repaired to the dining room elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether would take the place which in all their former parties had be longed to him by her sister her prudent mother occupied by the same ideas to invite him to sit by herself on entering the room he seemed to hesitate but jane happened to look round and happened to smile it was decided he placed himself by her elizabeth with a triumphant sensation looked towards his friend he bore it with noble indifference and she would have imagined that had received his sanction to be happy had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards mr with an expression of half alarm his behaviour to her sister was such during dinner time as showed an admiration of her which though more guarded than formerly persuaded elizabeth that if left wholly to himself jane s happiness and his own would be speedily secured though she dared not depend upon the consequence she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour it gave her all the animation that her spirits and prejudice could boast for she was in no cheerful humour mr was almost as far from her as the table could divide them he was on one side of her mother she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either or make either appear to advantage she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did her mother s made the sense of what they owed him more painful to â s mind she would at times have given any thing to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor by the whole of the family she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together that the whole of the visit would not pass away without them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere salutation attending his entrance and uneasy the period which passed in the drawing room before the gentlemen came was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her she looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend if he does not come to me then said she i shall give him up for ever the came and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes but alas the ladies had crowded round the table where was making tea and elizabeth pouring out the coffee in so close a con that there was not a single near her which would admit of a chair and on the gentlemen s approaching one of the girls moved closer to her than ever and said in a whisper â the men shan t come and part us i am determined ve want none of them do we had walked away to another part of the room she followed him with her eyes envied every one to whom he spoke had scarcely patience enough to help any body to coffee and then was enraged against herself for being so pride and a man who has once been refused how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love is there one among the sex who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman there is no so to their feelings she was a little however by his bringing back his coffee cup himself and she seized the opportunity of saying â is your sister at still yes she will remain there till christmas and quite alone have all her friends left her mrs is with her the others have been gone on to these three weeks she could think of nothing more to say but if he wished to converse with her he might have better success he stood by her however for some minutes in silence and i at last on the young lady s whispering to elizabeth again he walked away when the tea things were removed and the card tables placed the ladies all rose and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him when all her views were by seeing him fall a victim to her mother s for players and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party she now 
26,lost every expectation of pleasure they were confined for the evening at different tables and she had nothing to hope but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room as to make him play as as herself mrs had designed to keep the two gentlemen to supper but their carriage was ordered before any of the others and she had no opportunity of them well girls said she as as they were left to themselves what say you to the day i every thing has passed off uncommonly well i assure you the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw the was to a turn â and every body said they never saw so fat a the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the last week and even mr acknowledged that the were remarkably well done â pride and l and i suppose he has two or three french at least and my dear jane i never saw you look in greater mrs long said so too for i asked her whether you did not and what do you think she said ah mrs we shall have her at at last she did indeed i do think mrs long is as good a creature as ever lived â and her are very pretty behaved girls and not at all handsome i like them mrs in short was in very great spirits she had seen enough of s behaviour to jane to be con that she would get him at last and her expectations of advantage to her family when in a happy humour were far beyond reason that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day to make his pro it has been a very agreeable day said miss io elizabeth the party seemed so well selected so suitable one with the other i hope we may often meet again elizabeth smiled you must not do so you must not suspect me it me i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it i am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are that he never had any design of engaging my it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man you are very cruel said her sister you will not let me smile and are provoking me to it every moment how hard it is in some cases to be believed and how impossible in others but why should you wish to persuade me that i feel more than i acknowledge that is a question which i hardly know how to answer we all love to instruct though we can teach only what is not worth knowing forgive me and if you per in indifference do not make me your and prejudice chapter xxii a few days after this visit mr called again and alone his friend had left him that morning for london but was to return home in ten days time he sat with them above an hour and was in remarkably good spirits mrs invited him to dine with them but with many expressions of n he confessed himself engaged elsewhere next time you call said she i hope we shall be more lucky he should be particularly happy at any time c c and if she would give him leave would take an early opportunity of waiting on them can you come to morrow yes he had no engagement at all for to morrow and her invitation was accepted with alacrity he came and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them dressed in ran mrs to her daughter s room in her dressing gown and with her hair half finished crying out â my dear jane make haste and hurry down he is come â mr is come he is indeed make haste make haste here come to miss this moment and help her on with her gown never mind miss hair we will be down as soon as we can said jane but i dare say is than either of us for she went up stairs half an hour ago oh hang what has she to do with it come be quick be quick where is your my dear but when her mother was gone jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters the same anxiety to get by themselves was visible again in the evening after tea mr retired to the library as was his custom and mary went up stairs to her instrument two obstacles of the five being thus removed mrs sat looking and at elizabeth and pride and prejudice for a considerable time without making any impression on them elizabeth would not her and when at last did she very innocently said what is the matter mamma what do you keep wink ing at me for what am i to do nothing child nothing i did not wink at you she then sat still five minutes longer but unable to waste such a precious occasion she suddenly got up and saying to â come here my love i want to speak to you took her out of the room jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth which spoke her distress at such and her entreaty that she would not give in to it in a few minutes mrs half opened the door and called out â my dear i want to speak with you elizabeth was forced to go we may as well leave them by themselves you know said her mother as soon as she was in the hall and i are going up stairs to sit in my elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother but remained quietly 
27,in the hall till she and were out of sight then returned into the drawing room mrs s schemes for this day were ineffectual was every thing that was charming except the professed lover of her daughter his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party and he bore with the ill judged of the mother and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper and before he went away an engagement was formed chiefly through his own and mrs s means for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband after this day jane said no more of her indifference not a word passed between the sisters concerning but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded unless mr returned within and the time seriously however she felt persuaded that all this most have taken place with that gentleman s was punctual to his appointment and he aod mr spent the morning tc ther as had heen agreed on the latter was much more than his com expected there was nothing of presumption or folly in that could provoke his ridicule or disgust him into silence and he was more and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him of course returned with him to dinner and in the evening mrs s invention was again at work to get every away from him and her daughter who had a letter to write went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea for as the others were all going to sit down to cards she could not be wanted to her mother s schemes but on her returning to the drawing room when her letter was finished she saw to her infinite surprise there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her on opening the door she perceived her sister and standing together over the hearth as if engaged in earnest conversation and had this led to no suspicion the faces of both as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other would have told it all their situation was awkward enough hut hers she thought was still worse not a syllable was uttered by either and elizabeth was on the point of going away again when who as well as the other had sat down suddenly rose and whispering a few words to her sister ran out of the room jane could have no from elizabeth where confidence would give pleasure and instantly embracing her acknowledged with the emotion that she was the happiest creature in the world t is too much she added by far too much i do not deserve it oh why is not every body as happy elizabeth s congratulations were given with a sincerity a warmth a delight which words could but poorly express and prejudice every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane but she would not allow herself to stay her sister or say half that remained to he said for the present i must go instantly to my mother she cried i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate or allow her to hear it from any one hut myself he is gone to my father already oh to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family how shall i hear so much happiness she then hastened away to her mother who had purposely up the card party and was sitting up stairs with who was left hy herself now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled that had given them so many previous months of surprise and vexation and this said she is the end of au his friend s anxious of all his sister s falsehood and contrivance the happiest wisest and most reasonable end r in a few minutes she was joined hy whose conference with her father had heen short and to the purpose where is your sister said he hastily as he opened the door with my mother up stairs she will he down in a moment i dare say he then shut the door and coming up to her claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship they shook hands with great and then till her sister came down she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness and of jane s and in spite of his being a lover elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be founded because they had for basis the excellent understanding and excellent disposition of jane and a general of feeling and taste between her and himself it was an evening of no common delight to them all and prejudice the satisfaction of miss s mind gave such a glow of sweet animation to her face as made her look than ever and smiled and hoped her turn was coming soon mrs could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings though she talked to of no thing for half an hour and when mr joined them at supper his voice and manner plainly showed how really happy he was not a word however passed his lips in allusion to it till their took his leave for the night but as soon as he was gone he turned to his daughter and said â jane i congratulate you you will be a very happy woman jane went to him instantly kissed him and thanked him for his goodness you are a good girl he replied and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled i have not 
27,a doubt of your doing very well together your are by no means unlike you are each of you so that nothing will ever be resolved on so easy that every servant will cheat you and so generous that you will always exceed your income i hope not so or in money matters would be in me exceed their income my dear mr cried his wife what are you talking of why he has four or five thousand a year and very likely more then ng her daughter oh my dear dear jane i am so happy i am sure i shan t get a wink of sleep all night i knew how it would be i always said it must be so at last i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing i remember as soon as ever i saw him when he first came into last year i thought how likely it was that you should come together oh he is the young man that ever was seen were all forgotten jane was beyond competition her favourite child at that moment she cared for no other her younger sisters soon began to pride and pr interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense mary for the use of the library at and begged very hard for a few balls there every winter from this time was of course a daily at coming frequently before breakfast and always remaining till after supper unless when some barbarous neighbour who could not be enough detested had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister for while he was present jane had no attention to bestow on any one else but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur in the absence of jane he always attached himself to elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her and when was gone jane constantly sought the same of relief he has made me so happy said she one evening by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring i had not believed it possible i suspected as much replied elizabeth but how did he account for it it must have been his sisters doing they were no friends to his acquaintance with me which i cannot wonder at since he might have chosen so much more in many respects but when they see as i trust they will that their brother is happy with me they will learn to be contented and we shall be on good terms again though we can never be what we once were to each other that is the most speech said elizabeth that i ever heard you utter girl it would vex me indeed to see you again the of miss s pretended regard would you believe it that when he went to town last november he really loved me and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again x s pride and prejudice he made a little mistake to be sure but it is to the credit of his modesty this naturally introduced a from jane on his and the little value he put on his own ood qualities elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friends for though jane had the most generous and heart in the worlds she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him i am certainly the most fortunate creature that existed cried jane oh why am i thus from my family and blessed above them all if i could but see you as happy if there were but such another man for you if you were to give me forty such men i never could be so happy as you till i have your disposition your goodness i never can have your happiness no no let me shift for myself and perhaps if i have very good luck i may meet with another mr in time the situation of affairs in the family could not be long a secret mrs was privileged to whisper it to mrs and ventured without any permission to do the same by all her neighbours in the were speedily pronounced to be the family in the world though only a few weeks before when had first run away they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune chapter one morning about a week after s engagement with jane had been formed as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining room their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the sound of a carriage and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn it was too early in the morning for pride and prejudice and besides the did not answer to that of of their neighbours the horses were post and neither the carriage nor the livery of the servant who preceded it were familiar to them as it was certain that somebody was instantly prevailed on miss to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion and walk away with him into the they both set ofi and the conjectures of the remaining three continued though with little satisfaction till the door was thrown open and their entered it was lady de they were of course all intending to be surprised but their astonishment was beyond their expectation and on the part of mrs and though she was perfectly unknown to them even inferior to what elizabeth felt she entered the room with an air more than usually un gracious made no other reply to elizabeth s salutation than a slight inclination of the head and sat down without say ing a word elizabeth had 
27,mentioned her name to her mother on her s entrance though no request of introduction had been made mrs all amazement though flattered by having a guest of such high importance received her with the utmost politeness after sitting for a moment in silence she said very stiffly to elizabeth â i hope you are well miss that lady i suppose is your mother elizabeth replied very that she was and that i suppose is one of your sisters yes madam said mrs delighted to speak to a lady she is my youngest girl but one my youngest of all is lately married and my eldest is somewhere about the ground walking with a young man who i believe will soon become a part of the family you have a very small park here returned lady after a short silence it is nothing in comparison of b my lady t dare say but i assure you it is much larger than sir william s this must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening in summer the windows are full west pride and mrs assured her that they never sat there after dinner and then added â may i take the of asking your whether you left mr and mrs well yes very well i saw them the night before last elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling but no letter appeared and she was completely puzzled mrs with great civility begged her to take some refreshment but lady very resolutely and not very politely declined eating any thing and then rising up said to elizabeth â miss there seemed to be a kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn i should be glad to take a turn in it if you will favour me with your company go my dear cried her mother and show her about the different walks i think she will be pleased with the elizabeth obeyed and running into her own room for her attended her noble guest down stairs as they passed through the hall lady opened the doors into the dining parlour and drawing room and ing them after a short survey to be decent looking rooms walked on her carriage remained at the door and elizabeth saw that her waiting woman was in it they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable how could i ever think her like her nephew said she as she looked in her face â as soon as they entered the lady began in the following manner â you can be at no loss miss to understand the reason of my journey hither your own heart your own conscience must tell you why i come elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment and prejudice indeed you are mistaken madam i have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here miss replied her in an angry tone you ought know that i am not to be with but however you may choose to be you not find me so my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness and in a cause of such moment as this i shall certainly not depart from it a report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago i was told that not only your sister was on the point of b ing most married but that you that miss elizabeth would in all be soon afterwards united to my nephew my own nephew mr though i know it must be a scandalous falsehood though i would not injure him so much as to suppose die truth of it possible i instantly resolved on setting off for this place that i might make my sentiments known to you if you believed it impossible to be true said elizabeth colouring with astonishment and disdain i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far what could your propose by it at once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted your coming to to see me and my family said elizabeth coolly will be rather a confirmation of it if indeed such a report is in existence if i do you then pretend to be ignorant of it has it not been by yourselves do you not know that such a report is spread abroad i never heard that it was and can you likewise declare that there is no hon for it i do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your you may ask questions which shall not choose to this is not to be borne miss i insist on being satisfied has he has my nephew made you an offer of marriage your has declared it to be impossible it ought to be so it must be so while he the x and prejudice use of his reason but your arts and may in a moment of have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family you may have drawn him in if i have i shall he the last person to confess it miss do you know who i am i have not been accustomed to such language as this i am almost the nearest relation he has in the world and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns but you are not entitled to know mine nor will such behaviour as this ever induce me to be explicit let me be rightly understood this match to which you have the presumption to can never take place no never mr is engaged to my daughter now what have you to say only this â that if he is so you can have no reason to suppose he will make an 
27,offer to me lady hesitated for a moment and then replied â the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind from their infancy they have been intended for each other it was the favourite wish of hie mother as well as of hers in their we planned the union and now at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth of no importance in the world and wholly to the family do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends to his engagement with miss de are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin yes and i had heard it before but what is that to me if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew i shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de you both did as much as you could in planning the marriage its completion depended on others if is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin why is not he to make another choice and if i am that choice why may not i accept him and because honour decorum prudence nay interest forbid it yes miss interest for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends if you act against the inclinations of all you will be and despised by every one connected with him your alliance will be a disgrace your name will never even be mentioned by any of us these are heavy misfortunes replied elizabeth but the wife of mr must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation that she could upon the whole have no cause to obstinate girl i am ashamed of you i l this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring is nothing due to me on that score let us sit down you are to understand miss that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose nor will i be from it i have not been used to submit to any person s i have not been in the habit of disappointment that will make your s situation at present more pitiable but it will have no effect on i will not be interrupted hear me in silence my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other they are descended on the maternal side from the same noble line and on the father s from respectable honourable and ancient though families their fortune on both sides is splendid they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses and what is to divide them â the pretensions of a young woman without family connections or fortune is this to be endured but it must not shall not be if you were sensible of your own good you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up in marrying your nephew i should not consider myself as that sphere he is a gentleman i am a gentleman s daughter so far we are equal true you are a gentleman s daughter but who was your mother who are your and d not imagine me ignorant of their condition whatever my connections may be said elizabeth x and prejudice if your nephew does not object to them they can be nothing to u tell me once for all are you engaged to him though elizabeth would not for the mere purpose of obliging lady have answered this question she not but say after a moment s deliberation â i am not lady seemed pleased and will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement i will make no promise of the kind miss i am shocked and astonished i ex to find a more reasonable young woman but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever i hall not go away till you have given me the assurance i require and i certainly never shall give it i am not to be into any thing so wholly unreasonable your wants mr to marry your daughter but would my giving you the wished for promise make their marriage at all more probable supposing him to be attached to me would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin allow me to say lady that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill judged you have widely mistaken my character if you think i can be worked on by such as these how far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs i cannot tell but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine i must beg therefore to be no farther on the subject not so hasty if you please i have by no means done to all the objections i have already urged i have still another to add i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister s infamous i know it all that the young man s marrying her was a patched up business at the expense of your father and and is such a girl to be my nephew s sister is her husband who is the son of his late father s steward to be his brother pride and heaven and earth â of what are you thinking are the shades of to he thus you can now have nothing further to say she answered you have insulted me in every possible method i must beg to return to the house and she rose as she spoke lady rose also and they turned back her was highly 
28,you have no regard then for the honour and credit of my nephew girl do you not that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of every body lady i have nothing further to say you know my sentiments you are then resolved to have him i have said no such thing i am only reserved to act in that manner which will in my own opinion constitute my happiness without reference to you or to any person so wholly with me it is well you refuse then to oblige me you re to obey the claims of duty honour and gratitude you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends and mi e him the contempt of the world neither duty nor honour nor gratitude replied elizabeth has any possible on me in the present instance no principle of either would be by my marriage with mr and with regard to the resentment df his or the indignation of he world if the former were excited by his marrying me it would not give me one moment s concern â and the w d in general would have too much sense to join in the and this is your real opinion this is your final resolve very well i shall now know how to act do not imagine miss that your ambition will ever be gratified i came to try you i hoped to find you but depend upon it i will carry my in this manner lady talked on till they were at the door of e carriage when turning hastily round she added â i take no leave of you miss i send do pride and prejudice to your mother you deserve do such attention i am most seriously displeased elizabeth made no answer and without attempting to persuade her to return into the house walked quietly into it herself she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs her mother impatiently met her at ihe door of the dressing room to ask why lady ca would not come in again and rest herself she did not choose it said her daughter she would go she is a very fine looking woman and her calling here was civil for she only came i suppose to tell us the were well she is on her road somewhere i dare say and so passing through thought she might as well call on you i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible chapter xxiv the of spirits which this extraordinary threw elizabeth into could not be easily overcome nor could she for many hours learn to think of it less than in lady it appeared had actually taken the trouble of this journey from for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr it was a rational scheme to be sure but from what the report of their engagement could was at a loss to imagine till she recollected that hu being the intimate friend of and her being the sister of jane was enough at a time when the expectation of one wedding made every body eager for another to sup the idea she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently and together her at lodge therefore for through their communication with the the report she concluded had reached lady had only set that down as almost certain and immediate which he had looked forward to as possible at some future time in revolving lady s expressions however she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her in this interference from what he had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage it occurred to elizabeth that she must an application to her nephew and how he might take a lar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared not pronounce she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt or his dependence on her but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her than she could do and it was certain that in the miseries of a marriage with one whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own his aunt would address him on his side with his notions of dignity he would probably feel that the arguments which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous contained much good sense and solid reasoning if he had been wavering before as to what he should do which had often seemed likely the advice and entreaty of near a relation might settle every doubt and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity could make him in that case he would return no more lady might see him in her way through town and his engagement to of coming again to must give way if therefore an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days she added shall know how to understand it i shall then give over every expectation every wish of his constancy if he is satisfied with only me when he might have obtained my affections and hand i shall soon cease to regret him at all the surprise of the rest of the family on hearing who sl pride and p their had been was very great but they satisfied it with the same kind of supposition which had appeased mrs s curiosity and elizabeth was spared from much on the subject the next morning as she was going down stairs she was met by her father who came out of his library with a letter in his hand said he i was going to look for you come into my room she followed him thither 
28,and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations she followed her father to the fireplace and they both sat down he then said â i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly as it principally concerns yourself you ought to know its contents i did not know before that i had two daughters on the brink of matrimony let me congratulate you cm a very important conquest the colour now rushed into elizabeth s cheeks in the conviction of its being a letter from the nephew instead of the aunt and she was whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all or that his letter was not rather addressed to herself when her father continued â you look conscious yoimg ladies have great in such matters as these but i think i may defy even sagacity to discover the name of your admirer this letter is from mr from mr and what can tie have to say something very much to the purpose of course he begins with congratulations on the approaching of my eldest daughter of which it seems he has been told by some of the good natured i shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says on that point what relates to yourself is as follows â pride and prejudice having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs and myself on this happy events let me now add a hint on the of another of which we have been advertised by the same authority your daughter elizabeth it is presumed wiu long bear the name of after her eldest sister has resigned it and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land can you possibly guess who is meant by this this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire â splendid property noble kindred and extensive patronage yet in spite of all these temptations let me warn my cousin elizabeth and yourself of what evils you may by a with this gentleman s proposals which of course you will be inclined to immediate of have you any idea who this gentleman is but now it comes out my motive for you is as follows â we have reason to imagine that his aunt lady de does not look on the match with a friendly eye mr you see is the man now i think i have surprised you could he or the have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related mr who never looks at any woman but to see a and who probably never looked at you in his life it is admirable elizabeth tried to join in her father s but could only force one most reluctant smile never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her are you not diverted oh yes pray read on after mentioning the of this marriage to her last night she immediately with her usual condescension expressed what she felt on the occasion when it became apparent that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin she would never give pride and her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match i thought it my duty to give the intelligence of to my cousin that she and her admirer may be aware of what they are and not run hastily into a marriage which has not heen properly mr moreover adds i am truly rejoiced that my cousin s sad business has been so well hushed up and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known i must not however neglect the duties of my station or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married it was an encouragement of vice and had i been the of i should very have opposed it you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian but never to admit them in your sight or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing that is his notion of christian forgiveness the rest of his letter is only about his dear s situation and his expectation of a young olive branch but you as if you did not enjoy it you are not going to be i hope and pretend to be at an idle report for what do we live but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our turn oh cried elizabeth i am excessively diverted but it is so strange yes that is what makes it amusing had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing but his perfect indifference and your pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd much as i writing i would not give up mr s correspondence for any consideration nay when i read a letter of his i cannot help giving him the preference even over much as i value the impudence and of my son in law and pray what said lady about this report did she call to refuse her consent to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh and as it had been asked without the least suspicion she was not distressed by his repeating it elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they pride and prejudice were not it was necessary to laugh when she would rather have cried her 
28,father had most cruelly her by what he said of mr s and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration or fear that perhaps instead of his seeing too little she might have fancied too h chapter xxv instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend as elizabeth half expected mr to do he was able to bring with him to before days had passed after lady s visit the gentlemen arrived early and before mrs had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt of which her daughter sat in momentary dread who wanted to be alone with jane proposed their all walking out it was agreed to mrs was not in the habit of walking mary could never spare time but the remaining five set off together and jane however soon allowed the others to them they behind while elizabeth and were to entertain each other very uttle was said by either was too much afraid of him to talk elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution and perhaps he im be doing the same they walked towards the because wished to call upon maria and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern when left them she went boldly on with him alone now was the moment for her resolution to be executed and while her courage was high she immediately said â mr i am a very selfish creature and for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings care not how much i may be yours i can no longer help thanking you for your kindness to poor sister f ver since i have known it i have been most anxious to pride and prejudice acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it were it known to the rest of my family i should not have merely my own gratitude to express i am sorry exceedingly sorry replied in a tone of surprise and emotion that you have ever been informed of what may in a mistaken light have given you uneasiness i did not think mrs was so little to be trusted you must not blame my aunt s first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter and of course i could not rest till i knew the particulars let me thank you again and again in the name of all my family for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble and bear so many for the sake of discovering them if you will thank me he replied let it be for yourself alone that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other which led me on i shall not attempt to deny but your family owe me nothing much as i respect them i believe i thought only of elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word after a short pause her companion added you are toe generous to trifle with me if your feelings are still what they were last april tell me so at once mt affections and wishes are unchanged but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation now forced herself to speak and immediately though not very gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change since the period to which he alluded as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances the happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never felt before and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do had elizabeth been able to encounter his eyes she might have seen how well the expression of delight diffused over his face became him but though she could not look ride and she could listen and he told her of feelings which in proving of what importance she was to him made his affection every moment more valuable they walked on without knowing in what direction there was too much to be thought and felt and said for attention to any other objects she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt who did call on him in her return through london and there relate her journey to its motive and the substance of her conversation with â dwelling emphatically on every sion of the latter which in her s apprehension peculiarly her and assurance in the belief that such a relation must assist her to obtain that promise from her nephew which she had to give but for her its effect had been exactly it taught me to hope said he as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that had you been absolutely decided against me you would have acknowledged it to lady frankly and openly elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied yes you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that after you so to your face i could have no scruple in you to all your relations what did you say of me that i did not deserve for though your were ill founded formed on mistaken premises my behaviour to you at the time had the reproof it was i cannot think of it without we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame to that evening said elizabeth the conduct of neither if strictly examined will be but since then we have both i hope improved in civility i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself the recollection of what i then said of my conduct my man my expressions during the whole of it is now and has been many months painful to me 
28,your reproof so well applied i shall never forget had you y and behaved in a more gentleman like manner those were your words you know not you can scarcely how they have tortured me though it was some time i confess before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice i was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression i bad not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way i can easily believe it you thought me then devoid of every proper feelings i am sure you did the turn of your countenance i shall never forget as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me oh do not repeat what i then said these recollections will not do at all i assure you that i have long been most heartily ashamed of it mentioned his letter did it said he â did it soon make you think better of me did you on reading it give any credit to its contents she explained what its effect on her had been and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed i knew said he that what i wrote must give you pain but it was necessary i hope you have destroyed the letter there was one part especially the opening of it which i should dread your having the power of reading again i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me the letter shall certainly be burnt if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard but though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely they are not i hope quite so easily changed as that i wrote that letter replied i believed myself perfectly calm and cool but i am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit the letter perhaps b an in bitterness but it did not end so the adieu is charity itself but think no more of the letter the feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely differ pride and ent from what they were then that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to he forgotten you must learn some of my philosophy think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind tour must be so totally void of reproach that the contentment arising from is not of philosophy hut what is much better of ignorance but with me it is not so painful recollections will intrude which cannot which ought not to be i have been a selfish being all my life in practice though not in principle as a child i was taught what was but i was not to correct my temper i was given good principles but left to follow them in pride and conceit unfortunately an only son for many years an only child i was spoiled by my parents who though good themselves my father particularly au that was benevolent and amiable allowed encouraged almost taught me to be selfish and to care for none beyond my own family circle to think of all the rest of the world to wish at least to think of their sense and worth compared with my own such i was from eight to eight and twenty and such i might still have been but for you dearest loveliest elizabeth what do i not owe you you taught me a lesson hard indeed at first but most advantageous by you i was properly i came to you without a doubt of my reception you showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased had you then persuaded yourself that i should indeed i had what will you think of my vanity i believed you to be wishing expecting my addresses my manners must have been in fault but not i e you i never meant to deceive you but my spirits might often lead me wrong how you must have hated me after that evening hate you i was angry perhaps at but my anger soon began to take a proper direction i am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me y e and prejudice we met at you blamed me for com ing no i felt nothing but surprise your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you my conscience told me that i no extraordinary politeness and i confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due my object then replied was to show you by every civility in my power that i was not so mean as to resent the past and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness to lessen your ill opinion by letting you see that your had been attended to how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you he then told her of s delight in her acquaintance and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn and that his gravity and there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend she expressed her gratitude again but it was too painful a subject to each to be dwelt on farther after walking several miles in a leisurely manner and too busy to know any thing about it they found at last on examining their watches that it was time to be at home what could have become of mr and jane was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs 
29,was delighted with their engagement his friend had given him the earliest information of it i must ask whether you were surprised said elizabeth not at all when i went away i felt that it would soon happen that is to say you had given your permission i guessed as much and though he exclaimed at the term she found that it had been pretty much the case on the evening before my going to london said he pride and prejudice â â i made a confession to him which i believe i ought to have made long ago i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent his surprise was great he had never had the slightest suspicion i told him moreover that i be myself mistaken in supposing as i had done that your sister was indifferent to him and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was i felt no doubt of their happiness together elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend did you speak from your own observation said she when you told him that my sister loved him or merely from my information last spring from the former i had narrowly observed her during the two visits which i had lately made her here and i was convinced of her affection and your assurance of it i suppose carried immediate conviction to him it did is most modest his had prevented his depending on his own ment in so anxious a case but his reliance on mine made every thing easy i was obliged to confess one thing which for a time and not offended him i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter that i had known it and purposely kept it from him he was angry but his anger i am persuaded lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sister s sentiments he has heartily forgiven me now elizabeth longed to observe that mr had been a most delightful friend so easily guided that his worth was invaluable but she checked herself she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at and it was rather too early to begin in the happiness of which of course was to be inferior only to his own he continued the conversation till they reached the house in the hall they parted y pride jam chapter xxvi my dear where can you have been walking to was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered the room and from all the others when they sat down to table she had only to say in reply that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own know ledge she coloured as she spoke but neither that nor any thing else awakened a suspicion of the truth the evening passed quietly by any thing extraordinary the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed the were silent was not of a disposition in which happiness in mirth and elizabeth and confused rather knew that she was happy than felt herself to be so for besides the im embarrassment there were other evils before her she anticipated what would be felt n the family when her situation became known she was aware that no one liked him but jane and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away at night she opened her heart to jane though was very far from miss general habits she was absolutely incredulous here you are joking this cannot be engaged to mr no no you shall not deceive me i know it to be impossible this is a wretched beginning indeed my sole dependence was on you and i am sure nobody else will believe me if you do not yet indeed i am in earnest i speak nothing but the truth he still loves me and we are engaged jane looked at her oh it can not be i know how much you dislike him you know nothing of the matter that is all to be forgot perhaps i did not always love him bo as and do now but in such cases as these a good memory is this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself miss still looked all amazement elizabeth i ain and more seriously assured her of its truth good heaven can it be really so yet now i must you cried jane my dear dear i would i do congratulate you but are you certain forgive the question â are you quite certain that you can be happy with him there can be no doubt of that it is settled between us already that we are to be the happiest couple in the world but are you pleased jane shall you uke to have such a brother very very much nothing could give either or myself more delight but we considered it we talked of it as impossible and do you really love him quite well enough oh do any thing rather than marry without affection are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do oh yes you will only think i feel more than i ought to do when i tell you all what do you mean why i must confess that i love him better than i do i am afraid you will be angry my dearest sister now be be serious i want to talk very seriously let me know every thing that i am to know without will you tell me how long you have loved him it has been coming on so gradually that i hardly know when it began but i believe i must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at another entreaty 
29,that she would be serious however produced the desired effect and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment when convinced on that article miss had nothing further to wish now i am quite happy said she for you will be as happy as myself i always had a value for wm it for but his love of you i must always y pride have esteemed him but now as s friend ai d your husband there can be only and yourself more dear to me but you have been very sly very reserved with me how little did you tell me of what passed at and i owe all that i know of it to another not to you told her the motives of her secrecy she had been unwilling to mention and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend but now she would no longer conceal from her his share in s marriage all was acknowledged and half the night spent in conversation good gracious cried mrs as she stood at a window the next mornings if that disagreeable mr is not coming here again with our dear what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here i had no notion but he would go a shooting or something or other and not disturb us with his company what shall we do with him you must walk out with him again that he may not be in s way elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet as soon as they entered looked at her so r and shook hands with such warmth as left no doubt of his good information and he soon said aloud mr have you no more lanes in which may lose her way again to day i advise mr and and said mrs to walk to mount this morning it is a nice long walk and mr has never seen the view it may do very well for the others replied mr but i am sure it will be too much for won t it owned that she had rather stay at home professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount and silently consented as she went up stairs ii get ready mrs followed her saying â pride and prejudice i te m te sorry that you should be forced to hay t v l l yourself but i hope you r mind it it is all for jane s sake you know and e is no occasion for talking to him except just now th so do not put yourself to inconvenience during their walk it was resolved that mr s should be asked in the course of the evening reserved to herself the application for her he could not determine how her mother would take it doubting whether all his wealth and be enough to overcome her of the ii r but whether she were violently set against the mi cl violently delighted with it it was that he r h mr would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her she could no more bear that mr should i r t of her joy than the vehemence of i â â â â r t â â â â il eve soon after mr withdrew to the li n bâ re saw mr rise also and follow him and ive st on seeing it was extreme she did not fear lies i but he was going to be made hat it should be through her means that his f child should be distressing him by her choice ho fi him with fears and regrets in of her a wretched reflection and she sat in misery till appeared when looking at him she was ik â by his in a few minutes he t e table where she was sitting with and while to admire her work said in a whisper li jf our he wants you in the library she â â â father was walking about room looking grave an b â said he f what are you doing oâ â of your senses to the accepting this man mt j di u always hated him m f did she then wish her former opinions had reasonable her expressions more moderate i it j td k her from ex and professions w as exceedingly awkward to give but they were s and prejudice now necessary and she assured with some confusion of her attachment to mr or in other words you are determined to have him he is rich to he sure and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than jane but will they make you happy have you any other said than your belief of my indifference none at all we all know him to he a proud un pleasant sort of man but this would he nothing if you really liked him i do i do like him she replied with in her eyes i love him indeed he has no improper pride he is perfectly amiable you do not know h really is then pray do not pain me by speaking of hi in such terms â v said her father i have given consent he is the kind of man indeed to whom i never dare refuse any thing which he to ask i now give it to if you are resolved on him but let me advise you to think better of lu f c your disposition i know that you l happy nor respectable unless you truly husband unless you looked up to him as superior your lively talents would place you in the greatest in an unequal marriage you could scarcely cape and misery my child let me not have the 
29,ef of seeing you unable to respect your partner ufe you know not what you are about t elizabeth still more affected was earnest and solemn in her reply and at by repeated assurances that mr was really the object of her choice explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone relating her absolute certainty that was n t the work of a day but had stood the te of many months suspense and with energy all his good qualities she did conquer her father s and reconcile him to the match well my dear said he when she ed speaking i have no more to say if this be the c he deserves pride and prejudice you could not have parted with you my to any one less worthy to complete the favourable impression she then told him what mr had voluntarily done for he heard her with astonishment this is an evening of wonders indeed and so did every thing made up the match gave the money paid the fellow s debts and got him his commission so much the better it will save me a world of trouble and economy had it been your doing i must and would have paid him but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way shall offer to pay him to morrow he will and storm about his love for you and there will be an end of the matter he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his ng mr letter and after laughing at her some time allowed her at last to go saying as she quitted the room if any young men come for mary or send them in for i am quite at leisure elizabeth s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight and after half an hour s quiet reflection in her own room she was able to join the others with tolerable composure every thing was too recent for gaiety but the evening passed away there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time when her mother went up to her dressing room at night she followed her and made the important communication its effect was most extraordinary for on first hearing it mrs sat quite still and to utter a syllable nor was it under many many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them she began at length to recover to about in her chair get up sit down again wonder and bless herself good gracious lord bless me only think dear me mr would have thought it and is it really true oh my sweetest how rich and how great you will be what pin money what jewels what prejudice carriages you will haye jane is nothing to it â at all i am so pleased â so happy such a charming man so handsome so tall ob my dear for my having disliked him so much before i hope he will overlook it dear dear a house in town i â very thing that is charming three daughters married ten thousand a year oh lord what will become of me i shall go distracted this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted and â rejoicing that such an was heard only by herself soon went away but before she had been three minutes in her own room her mother followed her my dearest child she cried i can think of nothing else ten thousand a year and very likely more t is as good as a lord and a special license â you must and shall be married by a special license but my dearest love tell me what dish mr is particularly fond of that i may have it to morrow this was a sad omen of what her mother s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be and elizabeth found that though in the certain possession of his warmest af and secure of her relations consent there was still something to be wished for but the morrow passed off much better than she expected for mrs luckily stood in such awe of her intended son in law that she ventured not to speak to him unless it was in her power to offer him any attention or mark her deference for his opinion elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him and mr soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem admire all my three sons in law highly said he perhaps is my favourite but i i shall like husband quite as well as jane s and s s chapter elizabeth s spirits soon rising to again she wanted mr to account for his having ever fallen in love with her how could you begin said she i can comprehend your going on when you had once made a beginning but what could set you off in the first place i cannot fix on the hour or the spot or the look or the words which laid the foundation it is too long ago i was in the middle before i knew that i had begun my beauty you had early and as for my manners â my behaviour to you was at least always on the and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not now be sincere did you admire me for my impertinence for the of your mind i did you may as well call it impertinence at once it was yery little less the fact is that you were sick of civility of deference of attention you were disgusted with the women who were 
29,always speaking and looking and thinking for your approbation alone i roused and interested you because i was so unlike them had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself your feelings were noble and just and in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so you there â i have saved you the trouble of for it and really all things considered i begin to think it perfectly reasonable to be sure you know no actual good of me â but nobody thinks of aa when they fall in love was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to jane while she was ill at dearest jane who could have done less for her but make a virtue of it by all means my good qualities are under your protection and you are to them pride and prejudice as much as possible and in return it belongs to me to find occasions for and quarrelling with you as often as may be and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last what made you so shy of me when you first called and afterwards dined here why especially when you called did you look as if you did not care about me because you were grave and silent and gave me bo encouragement but i was embarrassed and so was i you might have talked to me more when you came to dinner a man who had felt less might how unlucky that you should have a answer to give and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it but i wonder how long you have gone on if you had been left to yourself i wonder when you would have spoken if i had not asked you my tion of thanking you for your kindness to had great effect too much i am afraid for what becomes of the moral if our comfort springs from a breach of promise for i ought not to have mentioned the subject this will never do you need not distress yourself the moral will he perfectly fair lady s to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude i was not in a humour to wait for an opening of yours my aunt s intelligence had given me hope and i was determined at once to know every thing lady has been of infinite use which ought to make her happy for she loves to be of use but tell me what did you come down to for was it merely to ride to and be embarrassed or had you intended any more serious consequences my real purpose was to see you and to judge if i could whether i might ever hope to make you love me my one or what i to myself was to see pride and prejudice whether your sister was still partial to and if she were to make the confession to him which i have since made shall you ever have courage to announce to lady what is to her am more likely to want time than courage but it ought to he done and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall he done directly j d if i had not a letter to write myself i might sit hy you and admire the of your writing as another young lady once did but i have an aunt too who must not he longer neglected from an to confess how much her intimacy with mr had heen over elizabeth had never yet answered mrs s long letter hut now having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness and immediately wrote as follows â i would have thanked you before my dear aunt as i ought to have done for your long kind satisfactory de tail of particulars but to say the truth i was too cross to write you supposed more than really existed but now suppose as much as you choose give a loose to your fancy indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford and unless you believe me actually mar you cannot greatly you must write again very soon and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last i thank you again and again for not going to the lakes how could i be so silly as to wish it your idea of the is delightful we will go round the park every day i am the happiest creature in the world perhaps other people have said so before but no one such justice i am happier even than jane she only smiles i laugh mr sends you all the love in the world that can be spared from me you are all to come to at christmas yours c mr s letter to lady was in a different style and still different from either was what mr sent to mr in return for his last and dear sir i yoa more for elizabeth will soon be the wife of mr lady as well as can but if i were yon i would stand by the nephew he has more to give sincerely c miss s to her brother on his approaching marriage were all that was affectionate and she wrote even to jane on the occasion to express her delight and repeat all her former professions of regard jane was not deceived but she was affected and though feeling no reliance on her could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved the joy which miss expressed 
30,on receiving similar information was as sincere as her brother s in sending it four sides of paper were insufficient to contain ail her delight and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister before any answer could arrive from mr or any congratulations to elizabeth from his wife the family heard that the were come themselves to lodge the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident lady had been rendered so exceedingly angry by ihe contents of her nephew s letter that really rejoicing in the match was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over at such a moment the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought when she saw mr exposed to all the and civility of her husband he bore it however with admirable calmness he could even listen to sir william when he com him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st james s with very decent composure if he did shrug his shoulders it was not till sir william was out of sight mrs s vulgarity was another and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance and though mrs as and well as her sister stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which s good humour encouraged yet whenever she did speak she must he vulgar nor was her respect for him though it made her more quiet at all likely to make her more elegant elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either and was ever anxious to keep him to herself and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure it added to the hope of the future and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should he removed from society so little pleasing to either to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at chapter for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs got rid of her two most deserving daughters with what delighted pride she afterwards visited mrs and talked of mrs may be guessed i wish i could say for the sake of her family that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible amiable well informed woman for the rest of her life though perhaps it was lucky for her husband who might not have domestic felicity in so unusual a form that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly mr missed his second daughter exceedingly his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do he delighted in going to especially when he was least expected mr and jane remained at only a so near a vicinity to her mother and relations was not desirable even to his easy temper or her affectionate heart the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified he an estate in a county to and jane and elizabeth in addition to every other source of happiness were within thirty miles of each other to her yery material advantage spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters in society so superior to what she had generally known her improvement was great she was not of so a temper as and removed from the influence of s example she became by proper attention and management less less ignorant and less from the further disadvantage of s society she was of course kept and though mrs frequently invited her to come and stay with her the promise of and young men her father would never consent to her going mary was the only daughter who remained at home and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs s being quite unable to sit alone mary was obliged to mix more with the world but she could still over every morning visit and as she was no longer by between her sisters beauty and her own it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance as for and their characters no revolution from the marriage of her sisters he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her and in spite of every thing was not wholly without hope that might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune the letter which elizabeth received from on her marriage explained to her that by his wife at least if not by j himself such a hope was cherished the letter was to this â my dear i you joy if you love mr half so well as i do my dear you must be very happy it is a great comfort to have you rich and when you have nothing else to do i hope you will think of us i am pride and sure would like a place at court very much and i do not think we shall haye quite money enough to upon without some help any place would do of three or four hundred a year but however do not speak to mr it if you had rather not yours c as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind such however as it was in her power to afford by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expenses she frequently sent them it had always been evident to her that 
30,thomas of park in the county of and to he thereby raised to the rank of a s lady with all the comforts and consequences of a handsome house and large income all exclaimed on the greatness of the match and her uncle the lawyer himself allowed her to be at least three thousand pounds short of any claim to it she had two sisters to be by her elevation and such of their acquaintance as thought miss ard and miss quite as handsome as miss maria did not scruple to their marrying with almost e advantage but there certainly are not so many men of large fortune in the world as there are pretty women to deserve them miss ward at the end of half a dozen years herself obliged to be attached to the mr a friend of her brother in law with scarcely any private fortune and miss yet worse miss ward s match indeed when it came to the y point was not contemptible sir thomas being happily able to give his friend an income in the living of and mr and mrs began their career of with very little less than a sat miss married in the common sâ c b â oblige her family and by fixing on a lieutenant of without education fortune or connections did it very thoroughly she could hardly have made a more choice sir thomas had interest which from principle as well as pride from a general wish of doing right and a desire of seeing all that were connected with him in situations of respectability he would have been glad to exert for the advantage of lady s sister but her husband s profession was such as no interest could reach and before he had time to devise any other method of assisting them an absolute breach between the sisters had taken place it was the natural result of the conduct of each party and such as a very marriage almost always produces to save from useless remonstrance mrs price never wrote to her family on the subject till actually lady who was a woman of very tranquil feelings and a temper remarkably easy and indolent would have ted herself with merely giving up her sister and thinking no more of the matter but mrs had a spirit of activity which could not be satisfied till she had written a long and angry letter to to point out the of her conduct and threaten her with all its possible ill consequences mrs price in her turn was injured and angry and an answer which comprehended each sister in its bitterness and bestowed such very reflections oh the pride of sir thomas as mrs could not possibly keep to herself put an end to all intercourse be them for a considerable period their homes were so distant and the circles in which they moved so distinct as almost to the means of ever hearing of each other s existence during the eleven following years or at least to make it very wonderful to sir thomas that mrs should ever have it in her power to tell them as she now and then did in an angry voice that had got another child y the end of eleven years however mrs price could no longer afford to cherish pride or resentment or to lose one connection that might possibly assist her a large and still increasing family a husband for active service the aâ e to r and good liquor and a very small to supply th wants made her eager to regain die friends she had so carelessly sacrificed and she dressed lady in a letter which spoke so much such a of children â nd a want of almost every thing else as could not bat dispose them all to a reconciliation she was pre â

situation would bt beneath him â or what did sir thomas think of or how could a boy be sent out to the east the letter was not it re established and sir thomas sent friendly advice and i lady despatched money and baby and wrote the letters such were its immediate effects and within a twelve a more important advantage to mrs price resulted it was often observing to the others that she could not get her poor sister and her family out of her head and that much as they had all done for her she to be wanting to do more and at she could not but own it to be her wish that poor mrs price should be from the charge and expense of one child en out of her great what if they were among them to undertake the care of her daughter a girl now nine years old of an age to require more attention than her poor mo er possibly give the trouble and expense of it to them would be nothing compared with the benevolence of the lady agreed with her instantly i think ve cannot do better said e let us send

out in the park and shall teu me all about your â brothers and sisters on pursuing the subject he found that dear as all these brothers and sisters generally were there was one among them who ran more in her thoughts than the it was william whom she talked of most and wanted most to see william the eldest a year older than herself her constant companion and friend her advocate with her of whom he was the darling in every distress william did not like she should come away he had lier he should miss her very much indeed â but william will write to you i dare say â yes be had pro he would but he had told aâ r to writ first â a park is when shall you da it she hung her head and answered hesitatingly she did pot know she had not any paper if that he all your difficulty i will furnish you with paper and every other material and you may write your letter whenever you would it make you happy to write to â yes very then let it he done now come with me into the room we shall find every thing there and be sure of having the room to ourselves but â will it go to the post yes depend upon me it shall it shall go with the letters and as your wiu frank it it will cost nothing my uncle repeated with a frightened look yes when you have written the letter i will take it to my father to frank thought it a hold measure hut no farther resistance and they went together into the breakfast room where prepared her paper and ruled her lines with all the good will that her brother could himself have felt and probably with somewhat more he con with her the whole time of her writing to assist her with his or his as either were wanted and added to these attentions which she felt very much a kindness to her brother which delighted her beyond all die he wrote with his own hand his love to his cousin william and sent him a guinea under the seal s feelings on the occasion were such as she believed herself incapable of expressing but her countenance and a few words fully conveyed all their gratitude and delight and her cousin began to find her an interesting he talked to her more and from all that she said was convinced of her having an affectionate heart and a strong desire of doing right and he could perceive her to be farther entitled to attention by great sensibility of her and great timidity he had never given her pain but he now felt that she required more po kindness and with that view int place to lessen her fears of them all and we a great deal of good as to playing and and being as merry as this day more she she had a and the kindness of her gave her better spirits with eâ ery body the place became less strange and the p less iâ and if there were some amongst whom as could not cease to she began at least to know their and to catch the best manner of ta them the little and which had at first made on the tranquillity of and not least of herself wore away and she w â no longer afraid to appear before hei uncle nor did her aunt s voice her start much to her cousins she became an companion though unworthy from inferiority of age and strength to be their constant their pleasures and schemes were sometimes of a to make a third very useful especially when that third was of an obliging yielding temper and they could not but own when their aunt into her faults or their brother urged her claims to their that was good natured enough was uniformly kind himself and she had nothing worse to endure on the part of tom than that sort of merriment which a young man of seventeen will always think mr with a of ten he was just entering into e full of spirits and with all the liberal dispositions of an eldest son who feels bom only for expense and enjoyment his kindness to his cousin was consistent with his situation and rights he made her some very pretty presents and laughed at her as her appearance and spirits improved sir thomas and mrs thought with greater satisfaction of their benevolent plan and it was pretty soon decided between them that though far from clever she showed a and seemed likely to give them little trouble a mean opinion of her abilities was not confined to them could read work and write but she had been taught nothing more and as her cousins her of ma y with which they had heen long familiar they thought her stupid and for e first two or three weeks were continually some report of it into the drawing room dear thinks n y cousin cannot put the map of europe together or my cousin cannot the u i in russia or she never heard of asia minor or she does not know the difference between water colours and how strange i bid you hear any thing so stupid my dear considerate aunt would reply it is ery had but you must not expect every body to be as and at learning as yourself aunt she is very ignorant i do you know we asked her last which way she would go to get to and she said she should cross to the isle of she 
31,thinks of nothing but the isle of and she it the island as if there were no other island in the world i am sure i should have been ashamed of myself if i had not known better long before i was so old as she is i cannot remember the time i did not know a great deal that sh has not the least notion of yet how l h g ago it is aunt since we used to repeat the order of the kings of i and with the dates of their accession and most of the principal events of their yes added the other and of the roman em as as besides a great deal of the heathen and all die semi distinguished philosophers very true indeed my but you are blessed with memories and your poor cousin has probably at all there is a vast deal of difference in as well as in every thing else and therefore you must make allowance for your and pity her deficiency and remember that if you are ever so forward and clever yourselves you always be modest for much as you already there is a great deal more for you to learn yes i know there is till i am seventeen but i mast tell you i thing of so odd and â o ig park stupid you know she says she does not ta either music or drawing to be sure my that is very stupid indeed and a great want of genius and but all things considered i do not know whether it is not as well that it should be so for though you know owing to me your papa and mamma are so good as to bring her up with you it is not at all necessary that she should be as accomplished as you are â on the contrary it is much more desirable that there should be a difference such were the by which mrs assisted to form her minds and it is not very that with a their promising talents and early information they should be entirely deficient in the less common of self knowledge generosity and humility in every thing but disposition they were admirably taught sir thomas did not know what was wanting because though a truly anxious father he was not outwardly affectionate and the reserve of his manner repressed all the of their spirits before him to the education of her daughters lady paid not the smallest attention she had not time for such cares she was a woman who spent her days in sitting nicely dressed on a sofa doing some long piece of needle work of little use and no beauty thinking more of her than her children but very indulgent to the latter i hen it did not put herself to inconvenience guided in every thing important by sir thomas and in smaller concerns by her sister had she possessed greater leisure for the service of her girls she would probably have supposed it unnecessary for they were under the care of a with proper masters and could want nothing more as for s being stupid at learning she could only say it was very unlucky but some people were stupid and must take more pains she did not know what else was to be done and except her being so dull she must f d she saw no harm in the poor little thing â and always found her very handy and quick in carrying messages and what she wanted with all her faults of ignorance and timidity j wi fixed at park and td transfer in its favour much of her attachment to her former home grew up there not unhappily among her cousins there no positive ill nature in maria or and though was often by their treatment of her she thought too lowly of her own claims to feel injured by it from about the time of her entering the family lady in consequence of a little and a great deal of gave up the house in town which she had been used to occupy every and remained wholly in th country leaving sir thomas to attend his duty in parliament with whatever increase or of comfort might arise from her absence in the country therefore the miss continued to exercise their memories practise their and grow tall and womanly and their father saw them becoming in person manner and accomplishments every thing that could satisfy his anxiety his eldest son was careless and extravagant and had already given him much uneasiness but his other children promised him nothing but good his daughters he felt while they retained the name of must be it new grace and in it he trusted would extend its respectable and the character of his strong good sense and of mind bid most fairly for utility honour and happiness to himself and all his connections he was to be a clergyman amid the cares and the complacency which his own children suggested sir thomas not forget to do t he could for the children of mrs price he assisted her in the education and disposal of her sons as they became old enough for a pursuit and though almost totally separated from her family was sensible of the truest satisfaction in hearing of any kindness towards them o of any thing at all promising in their situation or conduct once and once only in the course of many years had she the happiness of being with william of the rest she saw nothing nobody seemed to think of her ever going amongst them again even for a visit nobody at home seemed to want her but william soon after her to be a sailor a a park spend a week with his sister in before he went to sea their eager affection in meetings their ex delight in being together their hours of happy mirth and 
31,moments of serious conference may be imagined as well as the sanguine views and spirits of the boy even to the last and the misery of the girl when he left her luckily the visit happened in the christmas holidays when she could directly look for comfort to her cousin â dâ and he told her such charming things of what william was to do and be hereafter in consequence of his profession as made her gradually admit that the separation might have some use s friendship never failed her his leaving for oxford made no change in his hind dispositions and only afforded more frequent of proving them without any display of doing more than the rest or any fear of doing too much he was always true to her interests and considerate of her feelings trying to make her good qualities understood and to conquer the which prevented their being more apparent giving her advice consolation and encouragement kept back as she was by every body else his single support could not bring her forward but his attentions were otherwise of the highest importance in assisting the improvement of her mind and extending its pleasures he knew her to be clever to have a quick apprehension as well as good sense and a fondness for which properly directed must be an education in itself miss lee taught her french and heard her read the daily portion of his tory but he recommended the books which charmed her leisure hours he encouraged her taste and corrected her judgment he made reading useful by talking to her of what she read and heightened its attraction by praise in return for such services she loved him better than any body in the world except william her heart was divided between the two park chapter iii the first event of any importance in the family was the death of mr which happened when about fifteen and necessarily introduced alterations and mrs on the removed first to the park and afterwards to a small house of sir thomas s in the village and consoled herself for the loss of her husband by considering that she could do very well without him and for her of income by the evident necessity of economy the living was hereafter for and had his died a few years sooner it would have been duly given to some friend to hold till he were old enough for orders bat tom s extravagance had previous to that event been so great as to render a different disposal of the next necessary and the younger brother must help to pay for the pleasures of the elder there was another family living actually held for but though this had made the arrangement somewhat easier to sir thomas s conscience he could not but feel it to be an act of injustice and he earnestly tried to impress his eldest son with the same conviction in the hope of producing a better effect than any thing he had yet been able to say or do i for you tom said he in his most dignified manner i blush for the expedient which i am driven on and i trust i may pity your feelings as a brother on the occasion you have robbed for ten twenty thirty years perhaps for life of more than half the income which ought to be his it may hereafter be in my power or in yours i hope it will to procure him better but it must not be forgotten that no benefit of that sort would have been beyond his natural claims on and that nothing can in be an equivalent for the certain advantage which he is now obliged to forego through the of your debts tom listened with some shame and some park escaping as quickly as possible could soon with selfishness reflect that he had not been half so in debt as some as his friends secondly that his father had made a most tiresome piece of work of it and that the incumbent whoever he might be would in all probability die very soon on mr s death the became the right of a dr grant who came consequently to reside at and on proving to be a hearty man of forty five seemed likely to disappoint s calculations but no he was a short sort of fellow and well with good things would soon pop off he had a wife about fifteen years his junior but no children and they entered the neighbourhood with he usual fair report of being very respectable agreeable people the time was now come when sir thomas expected his sister in law to claim her share in their niece the change in mrs s situation and the improvement in s age seeming not merely to away any former objection to their living together but even to give it the decided eh and as his own circumstances â i rendered less fair than heretofore by some recent losses on his west india estate in addition to his eldest son s extravagance it became not to himself to be relieved from the expense of her support and the obligation of her future provision n the fulness of his belief that such a thing must be he mentioned its probability to his wife and the first time of the subject s to her again happening to be when was present she calmly ol to her so you are going to leave us and live with my sister how shall you like it was too much surprised to do more than repeat her aunt s words going to leave you yes my dear why should you be astonished have been five years with us and my sister always meant to take you when mr died but you must come up and

32,house being only just large enough to receive herself and her servants and a spare room for a friend of which she made a very particular point the spare rooms at the had been wanted but the absolute necessity of a spare room for a friend was now never forgotten not all her precautions however could save her from being suspected of better or perhaps her very dis a ol x a of a room might have sir thomas to suppose it intended for lady soon brought the matter to a certainty by carelessly to mrs â â i think sister we need not keep miss lee any longer when goes to live with you mrs almost started live with me dear lady what do you mean is not she to live with you â i thought you had settled it with sir thomas me never i never spoke a syllable about it to sir thomas nor he to me live with me the last thing in the world for me to think of or for any body to that really knows us both good heaven what could i do with â me a poor forlorn widow unfit for any thing my spirits quite broke down what could i do with a girl at her time of life a girl of fifteen the very age of all others to need most attention â and care and put the spirits to the test sure ir thomas could not seriously expect such a thing sir thomas is too much my friend nobody that wishes me well i am sure would propose it how came sir thomas to speak to you about it indeed i do not know i suppose he thought it best but what did he say he could not say he wished toe to take i am sure in his heart he could not wish me to do it no he only said he thought it very likely and i thought so too we both thought it would be a comfort to you but if you do not like it there is no more to be â aid she is no here dear sister if you consider my unhappy state how can she be any comfort to me here am i a poor desolate widow deprived of the best of husbands my health gone in attending and nursing him my spirits worse all my peace in this world destroyed with barely enough to support hie in the rank of a and enable me to live so as not to disgrace the memory of the dear departed â what comfort could i have in taking such a charge park if i could wish it for my own sake i not do so unjust a thing by the poor girl she is in good hands and sure of doing well i must struggle my sorrows and difficulties as i can then you will not mind by yourself quite alone dear lady what am i fit for but solitude now and then i shall hope to have a friend in my cottage i shall always have a bed for a friend but the most part of my future days will be spent in utter seclusion if i can but make both ends meet that s all i ask for i hope sister things are not so very bad with you neither â considering sir says you will have six hundred a year lady i do not complain i know i cannot live as i have done but i must where i can and learn to be a better manager i have been a liberal house enough but i shall not be ashamed to practise now my situation is as much altered as my income a great many things were due from poor mr as clergyman of the parish that cannot be expected from me it is unknown how much was consumed in our kitchen by odd comers and at the white house matters must be better looked after i must live within my income or i shall be miserable and i own it would give me great to be able to do rather more â to lay by a little at the end of the year i dare say you will you always do don t you my object lady is to be of use to those that after me it is for your children s good that i wish to be richer i have nobody else to care for but should be very glad to think i could leave a little trifle among them worth their having you are very good but do not trouble yourself about them they are sure of being well provided for sir thomas will take care of that why you know sir thomas s means will be rather straightened if the estate is to make such poor returns park oh that will soon be settled sir thomas has been writing about it i know well lady said mrs moving to go i can only say that my sole desire is to be of use to your family and so if sir thomas should ever speak again about my taking you will be able to say that my health and spirits put it quite out of the question â besides that i should not have a bed to give her for i must keep a spare room for a friend lady repeated enough of this conversation to her husband to convince him how much he had mistaken his sister in law s views and she was from that moment perfectly safe from all expectation or the slightest allusion to it from him he could not but wonder at her refusing to do any thing for a niece whom she had been so forward to adopt but as she took early care to make him as well lis lady understand that whatever she possessed was designed for their family 
32,he soon grew reconciled to a distinction which at the same time that it was and complimentary to them would enable him better to provide for himself soon learnt how had been her fears of a removal and her spontaneous felicity on the discovery conveyed some consolation to for his disappointment in what he had expected to be so serviceable to her mrs took possession of the white house the arrived at the and these events over every thing at went on for time as the showing a disposition to be friendly and gave great satisfaction in the main among their new acquaintance t had their faults and mrs soon found them out the doctor was very fond of eating and would have a good dinner every day and mrs grant instead of to gratify him at little expense gave her cook as high wages as they did at park and was scarcely ever seen in her offices mrs could not speak with any temper of such nor of the quantity of butter and eggs that consumed in the house nobody loved plenty d park hospitality more than herself â nobody more hated pitiful doings â the she believed had never been wanting in comforts of any sort had never borne a bad character in her time but this was a way of going on that she could not understand a fine lady in a country was quite out of place her store room she thought might have been good enough for mrs grant to go into where she would she could not find out that mrs grant had ever had more than five thousand pounds lady listened without much interest to this sort of she could not enter into the wrongs of an but she felt all the injuries of beauty in mrs grant s being so well settled in life without being handsome and expressed her astonishment on that point almost as often not so as mrs discussed the other these opinions had been hardly a year before another event arose of such importance in the as might fairly claim some place in the thoughts and conversation of the ladies sir thomas found it expedient to go to himself for the better arrangement of his airs and he took his eldest son with him in the hope of him from some bad connections at home they left england with the probability of being nearly a twelve month absent the necessity of the measure in a pecuniary lights and the hope of its utility to his son reconciled sir thomas to the eâ rt of the rest of his family and of leaving his daughters to the direction of others at their present most interesting time of life he could not think lady quite equal to supply his place with them or rather to perform what should her own hut in mrs s watchful attention and in s ment he had sufficient confidence to make him go without fears for their conduct lady did not at all like to have her husband leave her i but she was not disturbed by any alarm for his safety or solicitude for his comfort being one of those d a persons who nothing can be dangerous or difficulty k to any body but themselves the miss were much to be pitied on the don not for sorrow but for their want of it their father was no object of love to them he had never seemed the friend of their pleasures and his absence was most welcome they were relieved by it from all restraint and without at one gratification that would probably have been forbidden by sir thomas they felt themselves immediately at their own disposal and to have very indulgence within their reach s relief and her consciousness of it were quite equal to her cousins i but a more tender nature suggested that her feelings were ungrateful and she really grieved because she could not grieve sir thomas who had done so much for her and her brothers and who was gone perhaps never to return f that she should see him go without a tear it was a ful he had said to her moreover on the very last morning that he hoped she might see william again in the course of the winter and had charged her to write and invite him to as soon as to which he belonged should be known to be in england this was so thoughtful and kind and he only have smiled upon her and called her my dear while h said it every former frown or address might have been forgotten but he had ended his speech in a way to sink her in sad mortification by adding if william does come to i hope you may be able to convince him that the many years which have passed since you parted have not been spent on your side entirely without improvement â though i fear he must find his sister at sixteen in some respects too much like his sister at ten she cried bitterly over this reflection when her uncle was gone and her cousins on seeing her with ted eyes set her down as a j chapter iv tom had of late spent so little of his time at home that he could he only missed and lady was soon astonished to find how very well they did even without his father how well could supply his place in talking to the steward writing to the attorney settling with the servants and equally saving hei from all possible fatigue or exertion in every particular but that of directing her letters the earliest of the travellers safe arrival in after a favourable voyage was received though not before mrs had been indulging in very dreadful fears and trying to make them whenever she could get him alone and as she depended on being the first person made acquainted 
32,with any fatal catastrophe she had already arranged the manner of break ing it to all the others when sir thomas s assurances of their both being alive and well made it necessary to lay by her agitation and affectionate preparatory speeches for a while the winter came and passed without their being called for the accounts continued perfectly good and in for her assisting their displaying their accomplishments and looking about for their future husbands had so much to do as in addition to all her own household cares some interference in those of her sister and mrs grant s doings to overlook left her very little occasion to be occupied even in fears for the absent the miss were now fully established among the of the neighbourhood and as they joined to beauty and brilliant a manner naturally easy and carefully formed to general civility and hey possessed its favour as well as its admiration their vanity was in such good order that they seemed to be quite free from it and gave themselves no airs while the l raises such secured round by their aunt to them in believing they had no faults lady did not go into public with her daughters she was too indolent even to accept a mother s gratification in witnessing their success and enjoyment at the expense of any personal trouble and the charge was made over to her sister who desired nothing better than a post of such honourable representation and very thoroughly the means it afforded her of mixing in society without having horses to hire had no share in the of the season but she enjoyed being useful as her aunt s companion when they called away the rest of the family and as miss lee had left she naturally became every thing to lady during the night of a ball or a party she talked to her listened to her read to her and the tranquil of such evenings her perfect security in such a â u from any sound of was welcome to a mind which had seldom known a pause in its or as to her cousins she loved to hear an account of them especially of the balls and whom had danced with but thought too lowly of her own situation to imagine she should ever be admitted to the same and listened therefore without an idea of any nearer concern in them upon the whole it was a comfortable winter to her for though it brought no william to england the never failing hope of his arrival was worth much the spring deprived her of her valued friend the old grey pony and for some time she was in danger of feeling the loss in her health as well as in her affections for in spite of the acknowledged importance of her riding on horseback no measures were taken for mounting her again because as it was observed by her she might ride one of her cousin s horses at any time when they did not want them and as the miss regularly wanted their horses every fine day and had no idea of carrying their obliging manners to the sacrifice of any real pleasure that time of course never came they took their cheerful rides in the fine mornings of april and may and park si ther sat at the whole day with one aunt or walked beyond her strength at the of the other lady holding exercise to be as unnecessary for every body as it was unpleasant to herself and mrs who was walking all day thinking every body ought to walk as much was absent at this time or the evil would have been earlier when he returned to understand how was situated and perceived its ill there seemed him but one thing to be done and that must have a horse was the resolute declaration with which he opposed whatever could be urged by the of his mother or the economy of his aunt to make it appear unimportant mrs could not help thinking that steady old thing might be found among the numbers belonging to the park that would do vastly well or that one might be borrowed of the steward or perhaps dr grant might now and then lend them the pony he sent to the post she could not but consider it as absolutely unnecessary and even improper that should have a re lady s horse of her own in the style of her cousins was sure sir thomas had never intended it and she must say that to be making such a purchase in his absence and adding to the great expenses of his stable at a time when a large part of his income was unsettled seemed to her must have a horse was s only reply mrs could not see it in the same light lady did she entirely agreed with her son as to the necessity of it and as to its being considered necessary by his father â she only pleaded against there being any hurry only wanted him to wait till sir thomas s return and then sir thomas might settle it all himself he would be at home in september â and where would be the harm of only waiting till september though â was much more displeased with his aunt than with his mother as least regard for her niece he could not help paying more attention to what she said and at length determined on a method of proceeding which would the risk of his father s thinking he had done too much and at the same time procure for the im means of exercise which he could not s field should be without he had three of his own ho not one that would carry a woman two of them were hunters the thirds a useful road horse this third he resolved to exchange for one 
33,that his cousin might ride b where such a one was to be met with and having once made up his mind the whole business was soon completed the new mare proved a treasure with a very little trouble she became exactly calculated for the purpose and was then put in almost full possession of her she had not supposed before that any thing could ever suit her like the old grey pony but her delight in s mare was far beyond any former pleasure of the sort and the it was ever receiving in the consideration of that kindness from which her pleasure sprung was beyond all her words to express she regarded her x as an example of every thing good and great as possessing worth which no one but herself could ever appreciate and as entitled to such from her as no feelings could be strong enough to pay her sentiments towards him were of all that was respectful grateful confiding and tender as the horse continued in name as well as fact the pro of mrs could its being for s use and had lady ever thought about her own objection again he might have been excused in her eyes for not waiting till sir thomas s return in for when september came sir thomas was still abroad and without any near prospect of finishing his business circumstances had suddenly arisen at a moment when he was beginning to turn all his thoughts towards england and the very great uncertainty in which every thing was then involved determined him on sending home his son and waiting the final arrangement by himself tom arrived safely bringing an excellent account of his health but to very little purpose as far as mrs concerned sir thomas s sending away his sou seemed to her so like a parent s care under the influence of a fore of to himself that she could not help feeling dreadful and as the long evenings of autumn came on was so terribly haunted by these ideas in the sad her cottage as to be obliged to take park ss refuge in the dining room of the park the return of engagements however was not without its effect and in the course of their progress her mind so pleasantly occupied in the fortunes of her eldest niece as to quiet her nerves if poor sir thomas were fated never to return it would he peculiarly to see their dear maria well married she very often thought always when they were in the company men of fortune and particularly on the introduction of a young man who had recently succeeded to one of the largest estates and finest places in the country mr was from the first struck with the of miss and inclined to marry soon fancied himself in love he was a heavy young man with not than common sense hut as there was nothing disagreeable in his figure or address the young lady was well pleased with her conquest being now in her twenty first year maria was beginning to think matrimony a and as a marriage with mr would give her the enjoyment of a larger income than her father s as well as her the house in town which was now a prime object it became by the same rule of moral obligation her evident duty to marry mr if she could was most zealous in the match by suggestion and contrivance likely to its to either party and among other means by an intimacy with the gentleman s mother who at present lived with him and to whom she even forced lady to go through ten miles of indifferent road to pay a morning visit it was not long before a good understanding took place between this lady and herself mrs herself very desirous that her son should man declared that of all the young ladies she had ever miss seemed by her amiable qualities and the best adapted to make him happy mrs accepted the compliment and admired the nice of character which could so well distinguish merit was indeed the pride and delight of them all perfectly â an angel and of course so surrounded by admirers must be difficult in her choice et jo fame as mrs could allow herself to decide on so short an acquaintance mr rush worth appeared precisely the young man to deserve and attach her after dancing with each other at a proper number of balls the young people justified these opinions and an engagement with a due reference to the absent sir thomas was entered into much to the satisfaction of their families and of the general on of the neighbourhood who had for many weeks past felt the of mr s marrying miss it was some months before sir thomas s consent could be received but in the mean while as no one felt a doubt of his most cordial pleasure in the connection the intercourse of the two families was carried on without restraint and no other attempt made at secrecy than mrs s talking of it every where as a matter not to be talked of at present was the only one of the family who could see a fault in the business but no representation of his aunt s could him to find mr a desirable companion he could allow his sister to be the best judge of her own happiness but he was not pleased that h c happiness should centre in a large income nor could he refrain from often saying to himself in mr s company â if this man had not twelve thousand a year he would be a very stupid fellow sir thomas however was truly happy in the prospect of an alliance so unquestionably advantageous and of which he heard nothing but the perfectly good and agreeable it was a connection exactly of the right sort â in the same 
33,county and the same interest â and his most hearty was conveyed as soon as possible he only that the marriage should not take place before his return which he was again looking eagerly forward to he wrote in april and had strong hopes of settling every thing to his entire satisfaction and leaving before the end of the summer such was the state of affairs in the month of july and had just reached her year when the society of the village received an addition in the brother park sister of mrs a mr and miss the children of her mother hy a second marriage they were young people of fortune the son had a good estate in the daughter twenty thousand pounds as children their sister had heen always very fond of them hut as her own marriage had heen soon followed hy the death of their common parent which left them to the care of a brother of their father of whom mrs grant knew nothing she had scarcely seen them since in their uncle s house they had found a kind home admiral and mrs thou agreeing in nothing else were united in affection for these children or at least were no farther adverse in their feelings than that each had their favourite to whom they showed the greatest fondness of the two the admiral delighted in the mrs on the girl and it was the lady s death which now obliged her after some months further trial at her uncle s house to find another home admiral was a man of vicious conduct who chose instead of retaining his niece to bring his mistress under his own roof and to this mrs grant was indebted for her sister s proposal of coming to her a measure quite as welcome on one side as it could be expedient on the other for mrs grant having by time run through the usual resources of ladies in the country without a family of children having more than filled her favourite sitting room with pretty furniture and made a choice collection of plants and poultry â was very much in want of some variety at home the arrival therefore of a sister whom she had always and now hoped to retain with her as long as she single was highly agreeable and her chief anxiety was lest should not satisfy the habits of a young woman who had been mostly used to london miss was not entirely free from similar apprehensions though they arose principally from doubts of her sister s style of living and tone of society and it was not till after she had tried in vain to persuade her brother to settle with her at his own country house that she could resolve to hazard herself among her other to any thing like a of abode or ol d henry had a he his in an ef bat he d die into and as readily to fetch her away again at half an hour s she were weary of the ace the meeting was on side miss a sister without or â a sister s husband who lodged die gentleman and a house and fitted up and mrs grant in those whom she hoped to love better than ever a young man and woman of very appearance mary was remarkably pretty henry thou not handsome had air and countenance the manners of both were lively and pleasant and mrs grant immediately gave them credit for every thing else she was delighted with each but mary was her dearest object and having never been able to glory in beauty of her own she thoroughly enjoyed the power of being proud of her sister s she had not waited her arrival to look out for a suitable match for her she had fixed on tom the son of a was not too good for a girl of twenty thousand pounds with all the el ance and accomplishments which mrs grant foresaw in her and being a warm hearted woman mary had not been three hours in the house before she told her what she had planned miss was glad to find a family of such consequence so very near them and not at all displeased either at her sister s early care or the choice it had fallen on matrimony was her object provided she could marry well and having seen mr in town she knew objection could no more be made to his person than to his situation in life while she treated it as a joke therefore she did not forget to think of it seriously the scheme was soon repeated to henry and now added mrs grant i have thought of something to make it quite complete i should dearly love to settle you both in this country and therefore henry you shall marry the youngest miss a nice hand park s good humoured accomplished girl who will make you very happy henry bowed and thanked her my dear sister said mary if you can persuade him into any thing of the sort it will be a fresh matter of delight to me to find myself allied to any body so and i shall only r that you have not half a dozen daughters to dispose of if you can persuade henry to marry you must have the address of a all that english abilities can do has been tried already i have very particular friends who have been all dying for him in their turn and the pains which they their mothers very clever women as well as my dear aunt and myself have taken to reason or trick him into marrying is inconceivable i he is the most horrible that can be

34,company is frequently too sudden they sometimes pass in such very little time from reserve to quite the opposite â to confidence that is the part of the pre sent system one does not like to see a girl of eighteen or nineteen so immediately up to every thing â and perhaps when one has seen her hardly able to speak the year before mr i dare say you have sometimes met with such changes i believe i have but this is hardly fair i see what you are at you are me and miss no indeed miss i do not know who or what you mean i am quite in the dark but i will you with a great deal of pleasure if you will tell me what about ah you carry it off very well but i cannot be quite far imposed on you must have had miss in your eye in describing an altered young lady you paint too accurately for mistake it was exactly so the of baker street we were speaking of them the other day you know you have heard me mention charles the circumstance was precisely as this lady has represented it when first introduced me to his family about two years ago his sister was not and i could not get her to speak to me i sat there an hour one morning waiting for with only her and a little girl or two in the room the being sick or run away and the mother in and out every moment letters of business and i could hardly get a word or a look from the young lady â nothing like a answer â she up her mouth and turned from me with such an air i did not see her again for a she was then out i met her at mrs s and did not recollect her she came up to me me at an acquaintance stared me out of n talked and till i did not know which way to look i that i most be the jest of the room at the time and miss it is plain has heard the story and a very pretty story it is and with more truth in it i dare say than does credit to miss it if too common a fault mothers certainly have not yet got quite the right way of managing their daughters i do not know where the error lies i do not pretend to set people right but i do see that they are often wrong those who are showing the what female man should be said mr gallantly are doing a great deal to set them right the error is plain enough said the less courteous such girls are ill brought up they are given wrong notions from the bt they are always acting upon motives of vanity and there is no more real modesty in their behaviour be ore they appear in public than afterwards i do not know replied miss hesitatingly yes i cannot agree with you there it is certainly the part of the business it is much worse to have girls not out give themselves the same airs and take the same liberties as if they were which i have seen done that is worse than any thing â quite disgusting yes that is very inconvenient indeed said mr ber it leads one astray one does not know what to do the close bonnet and air you describe so well and nothing was ever tell one what is expected but i got into a dreadful scrape last year firom the want of them i went down to for a week with a friend last september just after my return from the west indies my friend â you have heard me speak of â his father and mother and sisters were there all new to me when we reached place they were out we went after them and found them on the pier â mrs and the two miss with others of their acquaintance i made my bow in form and as mrs was surrounded by men attached myself to one of her daughters walked by her side all the way home and made myself as agreeable as i could â the young lady perfectly easy in her manners and as ready to talk as to listen i had not a suspicion that i could be doing any thing wrong they looked just the same both well dressed with and like other girls but i found that i had been giving all my attention to the youngest who was not and had most excessively the eldest miss ought not to have been noticed for the next six months and miss i believe has never forgiven me that was bad indeed poor miss though i have no younger sister i fed for her to be n one s time must be very but it was entirely the mother s fault miss should have been with her such half and half doings never prosper but now i must be satisfied about miss price does she go to balls does die dine out every where as as at my sister s no replied i do not think she has ever been to a ball my mother seldom goes into company herself and nowhere but with mrs grant and stays at home with oh the point is dear miss price is not out chapter vi mr set off for and miss was pre to find a great chasm in their and to miss him in the meetings which were now becoming almost daily between the families and on their all dining together at the park soon after his going she her chosen place near the bottom of the table fully expecting to fed a most melancholy difference in the change of masters it would be a very flat business she was sure in comparison with his

34,say just now â in the middle of a very late hay harvest to hire a horse and cart i was astonished to find what a piece of work was made of it to want a horse and cart in the country seemed impossible so i told my maid to speak for one directly aiid as i cannot look out of my dressing closet without seeing one farm yard nor walk in the without passing another i thought it would be only ask and have and was rather grieved that i could not give the advantage to all guess my surprise when i found that i had been asking the most unreasonable most impossible thing in the world had offended all the farmers all the all the hay in the parish as for dr grant s i believe i had better keep out of his way and my brother in law himself who is all kindness in general looked rather black upon me when he found what i had been at you could not be expected to have thought on the subject before but when you do think of it you must see the importance of getting in the grass the hire of a at any time might not be bo easy as you o b park farmers are not in the habit of letting them out but in harvest it must be quite out of their power to spare a horse i shall understand all your ways in time but coming down with the true london that every thing is to be got with money i was a little embarrassed at first by the sturdy independence of your country customs however i am to have my harp fetched to morrow henry who is good nature itself has to fetch it in his will it not be conveyed spoke of the harp as his favourite instrument and hoped to be soon allowed to hear her had never heard the harp at all and wished for it very much i shall be most happy to play to you both said miss at least as long as you can like to listen probably much longer for i dearly love music myself and where the natural taste is equal the player must always be best for she is gratified in more ways than one now mr if you write to your brother i entreat you to tell him that my harp is come he heard so much of my misery without it and you may say if you please that i shall prepare my most plaintive airs against his return in compassion to his feelings as i know his horse will lose if i write i will say whatever you wish me but i do not at present foresee any occasion for writing no i dare say nor if he were to be gone a would you ever write to him nor he to you if it could be helped the occasion would never be foreseen what strange creatures brothers are you would not write to each other but upon the most urgent necessity in the world and when obliged to take up the pen to say that such a horse is ill or such a relation dead it is done in the possible words you have but one style among you i know it perfectly henry who is in every other respect exactly what a brother be who loves me me in me and will talk to me by the hour together has never yet turned the page in a letter and very often it is nothing more than â dear mary i am just arrived bath seems full and every thing as usual yours sincerely that is the true manly style â that is a complete brother s letter park s when they are at a distance from all their family â id colouring for william s sake they can write long letters miss price has a at sea said whose excellence as a correspondent makes her think yoa too severe upon us at sea has she â in the king s service of course would rather have had tell the story hut his determined silence obliged her to relate her brother s her voice was animated in speaking of his pro and the foreign stations he had been on but she not mention the number of years that he had been absent without tears in her eyes miss wished him an early promotion do you know any thing of my cousin s captain said captain you have a large acquaintance in the navy i conclude among large enough but with an air of grandeur we know very little of the inferior ranks post captains may be very good sort of men but they do not belong to us of various i could tell you a great deal of them and their flags and the of their pay and their and but in general i can assure you are all passed over and lu very ill used certainly my home at my uncle s brought me acquainted with a circle of of and i saw enough now do not be suspecting me of a i entreat â again felt grave and only replied it is a profession yes the profession is well enough under two if it make the fortune and there be discretion in spending it but in short it is not a favourite of mine it has never worn an amiable form to me to the harp and was again very happy in the prospect of hearing her play the subject of improving grounds meanwhile was still under consideration among the others and mrs grant could not help addressing her brother though it his from miss b â my dear henry have you to say been an yourself and from what i hear tf â t â it may with any place in england its beauties i am sure 
35,are great as it to be was perfect in my estimation such a happy â iu of ground and such timber what would not i give to see it again nothing could be so gratifying to me as to hear your opinion of it was his answer but i fear there would be some disappointment â you would not find it equal to your present ideas in extent it is a mere nothing â you would be surprised at its and as for im there was very little for me to do â too little â i should hke to have been busy much longer you are fond of the sort of said excessively but what with the natural advantages of the ground which pointed out even to a very young eye what little to be done and my own consequent resolutions i had not been of age three months before was all that it is now my plan was laid at westminster a little altered perhaps at cambridge and at one and twenty executed i am inclined to envy mr for having so much happiness yet before him i have been a of my own those who see quickly will resolve quickly and act quickly said you can never want employment instead of mr you should assist him with your opinion mrs grant hearing the latter part of this speech en forced it warmly persuaded that no judgment could be equal to her s and as miss caught at the idea likewise and gave it her full support declaring that in her opinion it was better to consult with friends and disinterested than immediately to throw the business into the hands of a professional man mr was very ready to request the favour of mr ford s and mr after properly his own abilities was quite at his service in any way that could be useful mr then began lo propose mr s doing he honour of coming over to and taking a bed there when mrs as if reading in her two minds approbation of a plan which was to take mr interposed with an there can be no doubt of mr s bat why should not more of us go should not we make a little party here are many that would be interested in your improvements my dear mr and that would like to hear mr s opinion on the spot and that might be of some small use to you with their opinions and for my own part i have been long wishing to wait upon your good mother again nothing but having do horses of my own could have made me so but now i could go and sit a few hours with mrs while the rest of you walked about and settled things and then we could all return to a late dinner here or dine at just as might be most agreeable to your and have a pleasant drive home by moonlight i dare say mr would take my two and me in his and can go on horseback you know sister and will stay at home with you lady made no objection and every one con in the going was forward in expressing their ready excepting who heard it all and said nothing chapter vii and how do you like miss said the next day after thinking some time on the subject himself how did you like her yes very well â very much i like to hear her talk she and she is so extremely pretty that i have t pleasure in looking at her it is her countenance so attractive she has a e i z park play of feature but was there nothing in conversation that struck you as not quite right oh yes she ought not to have spoken of her uncle as she did i was quite astonished an with whom she has heen living so many years and who whatever his faults may be is so very fond of her brother treating bin they say quite like a son i could not have believed it i thought you would be struck it was very wrong â and very ungrateful i think ungrateful is a strong word i do not know that uncle has any claim to her gratitude his wife certainly had and it is the warmth of her reject for her aunt s memory which her here she is awkwardly with such warm feelings and lively spirits it must be difficult to do justice to her affection for mrs without throwing a shade on the admiral i do not pretend to know which was most to blame in their though the admiral s present conduct might incline one the side of his wife but it is natural and amiable that miss should her aunt entirely i do not censure her but there certainly i in making them public do not you think said after a little consideration that this is a reflection itself upon mrs as her niece has been entirely brought up by her she cannot have given her right notions of what was due to the admiral that is a fair remark yes we must suppose the faults of the niece to have been those of the aunt and it makes one more sensible of the she has been under but i think her present home must do her good mrs grant s manners are just what they ought to be she speaks of her brother with a very pleasing yes except as to his writing her such short letters she made me almost laugh but i cannot rate so very highly the love or good nature of a brother who will not give himself the trouble of writing any thing worth reading to his sisters when they are separated i am sure wiu would never have used m so under any what right had to suppose that you would not write 
35,long letters when you were the right of a lively mind seizing whatever may contribute to its own amusement or that of others perfectly when by ill humour or and there is not a shadow of either in

both placed near a window cut down to the ground and opening on a little lawn surrounded by shrubs in the rich foliage of summer was enough to catch any man s heart the season the scene the air were

35,its gently rising beyond the village road and in dr grant s meadow she immediately saw the group â and miss both on horseback riding side by side dr and mrs grant and mr with two or three standing about and looking on a happy party it appeared to her â au interested in one object â cheerful beyond a doubt for the sound of merriment ascended even to her it was a sound which did not make her cheerful she wondered that forget her and felt a pang she could not turn her eyes from the meadow she could not help all that passed at first miss and her companion made the circuit of the field which was not small bt a foot s pace at her apparent â g to park they rose into a and to s timid nature it most astonishing to see how well she sat after a few mi they stopped entirely was close to her he was speaking to her he was evidently directing her of the he had hold of her hand she saw it or the imagination supplied what the eye could not she must not wonder at all this what could he more na than that should he making himself useful and proving his good nature hy any one she could not but thinks indeed that mr might as well have saved him the trouble that it would have been particularly proper and becoming in a brother to have done it himself but mr with all his boasted good nature and all his probably knew nothing of the matter and had no active kindness in comparison of she began to think it rather hard upon the mare to have such double duty if she were forgotten the poor mare be remembered her feelings for one and the other were soon a little by seeing the party in the meadow and miss still on horseback but attended by ed on foot pass through a gate into the lane and so into the park and make towards the spot where she stood she began then to be afraid of appearing rude and impatient and walked to meet them with a great anxiety to avoid the suspicion my dear miss price said miss as soon aa she was at all within hearing i am come to make my own apologies for keeping you waiting â but i have nothing in the world to say for myself â i knew it was very late and that i was extremely ill and if you please you must forgive me selfishness must always be forgiven you know because there is no hope of i cure s answer was extremely civil and his conviction that she could be in no hurry for then is more than time enough for my cousin to ride twice ai far as she ever goes said he and you have been pro i her comfort by preventing her from setting off an hour sooner clouds are now coming up and she will i park i r from the heat as she would have done then may not be fatigued by so much exercise ou had saved yourself this walk home part of it me but getting off this horse i m said she as she sprang down with his help strong nothing ever me but doing lo not like miss price i give way to you with a grace but i sincerely hope you will have a and that i may have nothing but good to hear of delightful beautiful animal ld coachman who had been waiting about with now joining them was lifted on hers set off across another art of the park her not lightened by seeing as she looked at the others were walking down the hill together nor did her attendant do her much good by his ts on miss s great cleverness as a he had been watching with an interest to her own s a pleasure to see a lady with such a good heart g said he never see one sit a horse better not seem to have a thought of fear very differ i you miss when you first began six years ago t lord bless me how you did tremble r thomas first had you put on drawing room miss was also celebrated in being gifted by nature with strength and was fully appreciated by the miss her n riding was like their own her early excellence is like their own and they had great pleasure in it as sure she would ride well said she for it her figure is as neat as her brother s added maria and her spirits are as good and he same energy of character i cannot but think d has a great deal to do with the i they parted at night asked to ride the next day i do not know not if you want tlie ber answer i do want her at all for be but whenever you are next inclined to stay at i think miss would be glad to have her for a time â for a whole morning in short she has a great desire to get as far as mn grant has been telling her of its fine views and i have lo doubt of her being perfectly equal to it but any will do for this she would be sorry to interfere with you it would be very wrong if she did she rides only for pleasure you for health i shall not ride to morrow certainly said i have been out very often lately and would rather at home you know i am strong enough now to walk very well looked pleased which must be s and the ride to common took place the next morning â the party included all the young people but herself and was much enjoyed at the time and doubly enjoyed again in 
35,the evening discussion a successful scheme of this sort generally brings on another and ike having been to common disposed them all for going somewhere else the day after there were many other views to be shown and though the weather was hot there were shady lanes wherever they wanted to go a young party is always provided with a shady lane four fine mornings were spent in this manner in showing the the country and doing the honours of its finest spots every thing answered it was all gaiety and good humour the heat only supplying enough to be talked of with pleasure â till the fourth day when the happiness of one of the party was exceedingly clouded miss was the one and were invited to dine at the and su was excluded it was meant and done by mrs grant with perfect good humour on mr rush worth s account who was partly expected at the park that day but it was felt as a very grievous injury and her good manners were severely to conceal her vexation and anger till she reached home as mr did not come the injury was increased and she had not even the relief of show ing her power oyer him she could only be to her mother aunt and cousin and throw as great a gloom as over their dinner and between ten and eleven and walked into the drawing room fresh with the evening air glowing and cheerful the very reverse of what they found in the sitting there for maria would scarcely raise her from her book and lady was half asleep even mrs by her niece s ill humour and having asked one or two questions about the dinner which not immediately attended to seemed almost to say no more for a few minutes the brother and sister were too eager in their praise of the night and their remarks on the stars to think beyond themselves but when the first pause came looking around said but where is is she gone to bed no not that i know of replied mrs she vas here a moment ago her own gentle voice speaking from the other end of the room which was a very long one told them that she was on the sofa mrs began scolding that is a very foolish trick to be away all the evening upon a sofa why cannot you come and sit here and employ yourself as we do if you have na work of your own i can supply you from the poor basket there is all the new that was bought last week not touched yet i am sure i almost broke my back by ting it out you should learn to think of other people and take my word for it it is a shocking trick for a young person to be always upon a sofa before half this was said was returned to her seat at the table and had taken up her work again x and who was in high good humour from the plea of the day did her the justice of exclaiming must say ma am that is as little upon the sofa as any body in the house said after looking at her i am sure you have the she could not deny it but said it was not very bad park i can hardly believe you he replied i know your looks too well how long have you had it since a little before dinner it is nothing but the heat did you go out in the heat out to be sure she did said mrs would you have her stay within such a fine day as this were not we all out even your mother was out to day for above an hour yes indeed added her who had been thoroughly awakened by mrs s sharp to was out above an hour i sat three quarters of an hour in the flower garden while cat i the roses and very pleasant it was i assure you but very hot it was shady enough in the but i declare quite dreaded the coming home again has been cutting roses has she yes and i am afraid they will be the last this year poor thing she found it hot enough but they were so full blown that one could not wait there was no help for it certainly rejoined mrs in a rather softened voice but i question whether her might not be caught then sister there is nothing so likely to give it as standing and stooping in a hot sun but i dare say it will be well to morrow suppose you let her have your i always forget to have mine filled she has got it said lady she has had it ever since she came back from your house the second time what cried has she been walking as weu as cutting roses walking across the hot park to your house and doing it twice ma am no wonder her head mrs was talking to and did not hear was afraid it would be too much for her said lady but when the roses were gathered your aunt wished to have them and then you know they must be taken home but were there roses to o lâ t to i park â no but they were to be put into the spare room to and forgot to lock the door of the m and bring away the key ao she was obliged to go got up and walked about the room s and could nobody be employed on such an errand but upon my word ma am it has been a very ill managed business i am sure i do not know how it was to have been done better cried mrs unable to be longer deaf unless i had gone myself indeed but i cannot be 
36,places at once and was talking to mr green at that very time about your mother s by her desire and had promised john groom to write to mrs about his son and the poor fellow was waiting for me half an hour i think nobody can justly accuse me of myself upon any occasion but really i cannot do every thing at once and as for s just stepping down to my house for me â it is not much above a quarter of a mile â i cannot think i was unreasonable to ask it how often do i pace it three times a day early and late ay and in all too and say nothing about it i wish had half your strength ma am if would be more regular in her exercise she â ould not be knocked up so soon she has not been out on horseback now this long while and i am persuaded that â hen she does not ride she ought to walk if she had been riding before i should not have asked it of her but i thought it would rather do her good after being among the roses for there is nothing so refresh ing as a walk after a fatigue of that kind and though the sun was strong it was not so very hot between ourselves â nodding significantly at his mother it was cut ting the roses and about in the garden that did the mischief i am afraid it was indeed said the more candid lady who had overheard her i am very much a aid she caught the there for the heat to kill any body it was as much as i could bear f d man park sitting and calling to and trying to keep from the flower beds was almost too much for me said no more to either lady but going to another table on which the supper tray yet remained brought a glass of to and obliged her ti drink the greater part she wished to be able to decline it but the tears which a variety of feelings created made ii easier to swallow than to speak vexed as was with his mother and aunt he was still more angry with himself his own of her was worse than any thing which they had done nothing of this would have happened had she been i considered but she had been left four days together without any choice of companions or exercise and without any excuse for avoiding whatever her unreasonable might require he was ashamed to think that for four days ther she had not had the power of riding and very seriously resolved however unwilling he must be to check a pleasure of miss s that it should never happen again went to bed with her heart as full as on the first evening of her arrival at the park the state of her spirits had probably had its share in her for she had been feeling neglected and been struggling against discontent and envy for some days past as she on the sofa to which she had retreated that she might not be seen the pain of her mind had been much beyond that in her head and the sudden change which s kindness had then occasioned made her know how to support herself chapter viii s rides the very next day and as it was a pleasant fresh feeling morning less hot than the weather had lately been trusted that her losses both of health and pleasure would foe soon made good while wise was gone mr arrived his mother taken came to be civil and to show her civility especially in park j of the plan for visiting m started a fortnight before and which in f fa subsequent absence from home had mrs and her were all ith its and an early day was named provided mr should be disengaged es did not forget that and though ould willingly have answered for his being so the liberty nor run the risk a hint from miss mr t the thing to be done was for him the directly and call on mr whether wednesday would suit him or return mrs grant and miss came een out some time and taken a different route they had not met him comfortable hopes i given that he would find mr at scheme was mentioned of course possible indeed that any thing else should be mrs was in hi spirits about it and th a civil thought nothing of consequence but as it wn and her son s concerns had not yet given lady to be of the party lady ber y declined it but her placid manner of still think she wished to come is s more numerous words and louder tone of the truth ue would be too much for my sister a great h i assure you my dear mrs re and ten you know you must ex on this occasion and accept of our two dear without her is the only place ft her a wish to go so far but it cannot be will have a companion in price you all do very well and as for â as i to speak for himself i will answer for his to join the party he can go on w p park mrs being to yield to lady i ta at home could only be sorry the loss of her s company would be a great and she have been extremely happy to have seen the young lady too miss price who had never been at yet and it was a pity she should not see the place you are very kind you are all kindness my dear madam cried mrs but as to she will have opportunities in plenty of seeing she has time enough before her and her going now is quite out of 
36,the question lady could not possibly spare her oh no â i cannot do without mrs proceeded next under the that every body must be wanting to see to include miss in the invitation and though miss grant who had not been at the trouble of visiting mrs on her coming into the neighbourhood declined it on her own account she was glad to secure any pleasure for her sister and mary properly pressed and persuaded was not long in accepting her share of the civility mr came back from the successful and made his appearance just in time to learn what had been settled for wednesday to attend mrs to her carriage and walk half way down the park with the two other ladies on his return to the breakfast room he found mrs l trying to make up her mind as to whether miss s being of the party were desirable or not or her brothers would not be full without her the miss laughed at the idea assuring her that the would hold four perfectly well independent of the box on which one might go with him but why is it necessary said that s carriage or his only should be employed why is no use to be made of my mother s chaise i could not when the scheme was first mentioned the other day understand why a visit from the family were not to be made in the carriage of the family what i cried go jo d u three in a post park in this weather when we may have seats in a ha no my dear that will not quite do besides said maria i know that mr upon taking us after what passed at first he would it as a promise and my dear added mrs taking out two carriages when me will do would he trouble for nothing and between ourselves coachman is not very fond of the roads between this and he always com bitterly of the narrow lanes scratching his carriage you know one should not like to have dear sir thomas when he comes home find all the scratched off that would not be a very handsome reason for using mr s said maria but the truth is that ii a stupid old fellow and does not know how to drive i will answer for it that we shall find no inconvenience from roads on there is no hardship i suppose nothing unpleasant in going on the box unpleasant cried maria oh dear i believe it would be generally thought the favourite seat there can be no comparison as to one s view of the country probably miss will choose the box herself there can be no objection then to s going witli yon there can be no doubt of your having room for her repeated mrs my dear there is no idea of her going with us she stays with her aunt i told mrs so she is not expected tou can have no reason i imagine madam said he addressing his mother for wishing no to be of the party but as it to yourself to your own comfort if you do without her you would not wish to keep her at home to be sure not but i cannot do her you can if i stay at home with you as i mean to do there was a general cry out at this yes he continued there is no necessity for my going and i mean to stay at home has a great desire to see i know it very much she f a gratification of the kind and i am rare ma am yon be glad to give her the pleasure now oh yes yery glad if your aunt sees no objection mrs was very ready with the only which could remain their having positively assured mm that could not go and the very strange appearance there would consequently be in taking her which seemed to her a difficulty quite impossible to be got over it must have the strangest appearance it would be something so very so on for mrs whose own manners were such a pattern of good breeding and attention that she really did not fed equal to it mrs had no tion for and no wish of her pleasure at any time but her opposition to â now arose more from partiality for her own scheme because it â â â her own than from any thing else she felt that she had arranged every thing extremely well and that any alteration must be for the worse when therefore told her in reply as he did when she would give him the hearing that she need not distress herself on mrs s ac count because he had taken the opportunity as he walked with her through the hall of mentioning miss price as one who would probably be of the party and had directly received a very sufficient invitation for her mrs nor was too much vexed to submit with a very good grace and would only say very well very well just as you choose settle it your own way i am sure i do not care about it it seems very odd said maria that you should be staying at home instead of i am sure she ought to be very much obliged to added hastily leaving the room as she spoke from a consciousness that she ought to offer to stay at home herself will feel quite as grateful as the occasion requires was s only reply and the subject s gratitude she heard the plan was in much greater than her pleasure she felt s kindness with all and more than all the which he of her fond attachment could be aware of j t that be should forego any enjoyment on her account gave her pain and her own satisfaction in seeing would be nothing 
36,without him the next meeting of the two families produced another alteration in the plan and one that was admitted with general approbation mrs grant offered as companion for the day to lady in of her on and dr grant was to join them at dinner lady was very well pleased to have it so and the young ladies were in spirits again ev n was very thankful for an arrangement which restored him to his share of the party and mrs thought it an excellent plan and had it at her tongue s end and was on the point of proposing it when mrs grant spoke wednesday was fine and soon after breakfast the arrived mr driving his sisters and as every body was ready there was nothing to be done but for mrs grant to and the others to take their places the place of au places the envied seat the post of honour was to whose happy lot was it to fall while each of the miss were meditating how best and with most appearance of obliging the others to secure it the matter was settled by mrs grant s sayings as she stepped from the carriage as there are five of you it will be better that one should sit with henry and as you were saying that you wished you could drive i think this will be a good opportunity for you to take a lesson happy unhappy maria the former was on the box in a moment the latter took her seat within in gloom and mortification and the carriage drove off amid the good wishes of the two remaining ladies and the barking of in his mistress s arms their road was through a pleasant country and whose rides had never been extensive was soon beyond her knowledge and was very happy in observing all that was new and admiring all that was pretty she was not often invited to join in tlie conversation of the others nor did she desire it her own thoughts and reflections were habitually her best companions and in ive v f of the country the bearings of the roads the of the state of the harvest the cottages cattle the children she found entertainment that a only have been heightened by having to of what she felt that was the only point of between her and the lady who sat by her in tl but a value for miss was very ur her she had none of s delicacy of taste of m of feeling she saw nature nature with observation her attention was all for men and women talents for the light and lively in looking back after however when there was any stretch of road them or when he gained on them in ascending a able hill they were united and a there he is the same moment from them both more than once for the first seven miles miss had very real comfort her prospect always ended in mr and her sister sitting side by side full of conversation merriment and to see only his expressive as turned with a smile to or to catch the laugh of other was a perpetual source of irritation which her sense of propriety could but just smooth over w looked bade it was with a countenance of and whenever she spoke to them it was in the spirits her view of the country was charming wished they could au see it sec but her only of change was addressed to miss as they the summit of a long hill and was not more inviting this here is a fine burst of country i wish you my seat but i dare say you will not take it let me p you ever so much and miss could hardly before they were moving again at a good pace when they came within the influence of it was better for miss who said to have two strings to her bow she had feelings and feelings and in the vicinity the former had considerable mr ru worth s consequence was hers she could not tell that those woods belonged to could not carelessly observe that she believed it was i a v s ab mr s property on each of the road â without of heart and it was a pleasure to increase with their approach to the capital mansion and residence of ihe family with all its rights of court and court baron now we shall have no more rough road miss oar difficulties are over the rest of the way is such as it ought to be mr has made it since he succeeded to the estate here begins the village those cottages are really a disgrace the church spire is reckoned remarkably handsome i am glad the church is not so close to the great house as often happens in old places the annoyance of the bells must be terrible there is the a tidy looking house and i un the clergyman and his wife are very decent pie those are houses built by some of the family to the right is the steward s house he is a very respective man now we are coming to the lodge gates but we have nearly a mile through the park still it is not ugly you see at this end there is some fine timber but the situation of the house is dreadful we go down hill to it for half a mile and it is a pity for it would not be an ill looking place if it had a better approach miss was not slow to admire she pretty well guessed miss s feelings and made it a point of honour to promote her enjoyment to the utmost mrs was all d light and and even had something to say in admiration and might be heard with complacency her eye was eagerly taking in every thing within 
36,her reach and after being at some pains to get a view of the house and observing that it was a sort of building which she could not look at but respect she added now where is the avenue the house fronts the east i perceive the avenue therefore most be at the back of it mr talked of the west front yes it is exactly behind the house begins at a little distance and for half a mile to the extremity of the grounds you may see something of it here â â of the more distant trees it is oak entirely park miss now speak with decided tion of what she had known nothing about when mr had asked her opinion and her spirits were in as happy a flutter as vanity and pride could furnish when they drove up to the spacious stone steps before the principal entrance chapter ix mr was at the door to receive his fair lady and the whole party were welcomed by him with due attention in the drawing room they were met with cordiality by the mother and miss had all the distinction with each that she could wish after the business of arriving was over it was first necessary to eat and the doors were thrown open to admit then through one or two rooms into the appointed dining parlour where a was prepared with abundance and elegance much was said and much was ate and all went well the particular object of the day was then considered how would mr like in what manner would he choose to take a survey of the grounds mr mentioned his mr suggested the greater of some cut which might convey more than two to be themselves of the advantage of other eyes and other judgments might be an evil even beyond the loss of present pleasure mrs proposed that the chaise should be taken also but this was scarcely received as an the young ladies neither smiled nor spoke her next proposition of the house to such of them as had not been there before was more acceptable for miss was pleased to have its size and all were glad to be doing something the whole party rose accordingly and under mrs guidance were shown through a number of park all and many large and amply in tbe taste of fifty years back with shining floors solid mahogany rich marble and carving each handsome in its way of pictures there were abundance and some few good but the larger part were family traits no longer any thing to any body but mrs who had been at great pains to learn all that the housekeeper could teach and was now almost equally well qualified to show the house on the present occasion she addressed herself chiefly to miss and but there was no comparison in the of their attention for miss who had seen scores of great houses and cared for none of them had only the appearance of listening while to whom every thing was almost as interesting as it was new attended with unaffected earnestness to all that mrs rush worth could relate of the family in former times its rise and grandeur visits and loyal efforts delighted to connect any thing with history already known or warm her imagination with scenes of the past the situation of the house excluded the possibility of much prospect from any of the rooms and while and some of the others were attending mrs henry was looking grave and shaking his head at the windows every room on the west front looked across a lawn to the beginning of the avenue immediately beyond tall iron and gates having visited many more rooms than could be supposed to be of any other use than to contribute to the window tax and find employment for now said mrs we are coming to the chapel which properly we ought to enter from above and look down upon but as we are quite among friends i will take you in this way if you will excuse me they entered s imagination had prepared her for something than a mere spacious room fitted up for the purpose of devotion â with nothing more striking or more solemn than the profusion of mahogany and the crimson velvet cushions appearing over the ledge of family i am di â d m park she in a low to this is not my of a chapel there is nothing awful here nothing melancholy nothing grand here are no no arches no no no cousin to be by the night wind of heaven no signs that a monarch sleeps below you forget how lately all this has been built and for how confined a purpose compared with the old of castles and it was only for the private use of the family they have been buried i sup pose in the parish church there you must look for the the achievements it was foolish of me not to think of all that but i am disappointed mrs began her relation this chapel was fitted up as you see it in james the second s time before that period as i understand the were only and there is some reason to think that the and cushions of the pulpit and family seat were only purple cloth but this is not quite certain it is a handsome chapel and was formerly in constant use both morning and evening prayers were always read in it by the domestic within the memory of many but the late mr left it every generation has its improvements said miss with a smile to mrs was gone to repeat her lesson to mr and and miss remained in a cluster together it is a pity cried that the custom should have been it was a valuable part of former times there is something in a chapel and so much in character 
37,with a great house with one s ideas of what such a household should be a whole family regularly for the purpose of prayer is fine very fine indeed said miss laughing it must do the heads of the family a great deal of good to force all the poor and to leave business and pleasure and say their prayers here twice a day while they are excuses themselves for staying away park that is hardly s idea of a family said if the master and mistress do not attend themselves there must be more harm than good in the custom at any rate it is safer to leave people to their own on such subjects every body to go their own way â to choose own time and manner of devotion the obligation of attendance the the restraint the length of time â altogether it is a formidable thing and what nobody likes and if the good people who used to kneel and in that gallery could have foreseen that the time would ever come when men and women might lie another ten minutes in bed when they woke with a without danger of because chapel was missed they would have jumped with joy and envy cannot you with what unwilling feelings the former of the house of did many a time repair to this the young mrs and mrs â up into seeming piety but with heads full of something very different â especially if the poor were not worth looking at â and in those days i fancy were very inferior even to what they are now for a few moments she was and looked at but felt too angry for speech and he needed a little recollection before he could say your lively mind can hardly be serious even on serious you have given us an amusing and human nature cannot say it was not so we must all feel at times the difficulty of fixing our thoughts as we could wish but if you are supposing it a frequent things that is to say a weakness grown into a habit from neglect what could be expected from the private of such persons do you think the minds which are suffered which are indulged in wanderings in a chapel would be more collected iu a closet yes very likely they would have two chances at least iu their favour there would be less to the attention from without and it would not be tried so long the mind which does not struggle against itself under one would objects to t va park other i believe and the influence of the place and of te ample may often rouse better feelings than are begun with the greater length of the service however i admit to be sometimes too hard a stretch upon the mind one wishes it were not so but i have not yet left oxford long enough to forget what chapel prayers are while this was the rest of the party being about the chapel called mr s tion to her sister by sayings do look at mr and maria standing side by side exactly as if the ceremony were going to be performed have not they completely the air of it mr smiled his acquiescence and stepping for ward to maria said in a voice which she only could hear i do not like to see miss so near the altar starting the lady instinctively moved a step or two but recovering herself in a moment affected to laugh and asked him in a tone not much if he would give her away i am afraid i should do it very awkwardly was his reply with a look of meaning joining them at the moment carried on the joke upon my word it is really a pity that it should not take place directly if we had but a proper license for here we are altogether and nothing in the world could be more snug and pleasant and she talked and laughed about it with so little caution as to catch the comprehension of mr and his mother and expose her sister to the whispered of her lover while mrs spoke with proper smiles and dignity of its being a most happy event to her whenever it took place if were but in orders cried and running to where he stood with miss and my dear if you were but in orders now yon might perform the ceremony directly how unlucky that you are not ordained mr and maria are quite ready miss s countenance as e might have amused a disinterested observer she looked almost aghast under the new idea she was receiving y pitied her park how distressed she will be at what she said just now passed across her mind ordained said miss what are you to be a clergyman yes i shall take orders soon after my father s re turn â probably at christmas miss her spirits and recovering her complexion replied only i had known this before i would have spoken of the cloth with more respect and turned the subject the chapel was soon afterwards left to the silence and stillness which reigned in it with few throughout the year miss displeased with her sister led the way and au seemed to feel that they had been there long enough the lower part of the house had been now entirely shown and mrs never weary in the cause would have proceeded towards the principal staircase and taken them through all the rooms above if her son had not interposed with a doubt of there being time enough for if said he with the sort of self evident proposition which a clearer head does not always avoid we are too going over the house we shall not have time for what is to be done out of doors it is past two and we are to dine at

37,be half a mile long in a straight line for we have never seen the end of it yet since we left the first great path but if you remember before we left that first great path we saw directly to the end of it we looked wn the whole vista and saw it closed by iron gates and it could not have been more than a in length oh i know nothing of your but i am sort it is a very long wood and that we have been winding in and out ever since we came into it and therefore when i say that we have walked a mile in it i must speak within compass we have been exactly a quarter of an hour here said taking out his watch do you think we are walking four an hour oh do not attack me with your watch a watch is always too fast or too slow i cannot be dictated to by a a few steps farther brought them out at the bottom of the very walk they had been talking of and standing back well shaded and sheltered and king over a ha ha into the park was a comfortable sized bench on which they all sat down i am afraid you are very tired said observing her why would not you speak sooner this will be a bad day s amusement for you if you are to be knocked up every sort of exercise her so soon miss except riding park s and courtesy the of the ceremonies of life the i of might rather he called perhaps the result of good principles the effect in of those doctrines which it is their duty to teach and recommend and it will i be every where found that as the clergy are or are not what they ought to he so are the rest of the nation certainly said with gentle earnestness there cried miss you have quite convinced miss price already i wish i could convince miss too i do not think you ever will said she with an arch i am just as much surprised now as i was at first that you intend to take orders you really are fit for something better come do change your mind it is not too late go into the law go into the law with as much ease as i was told t go into this wilderness now you are going to say something about law being the worst wilderness of the two but i you member i have you you need not hurry when the object is only to prevent saying a b ai for there is not the least wit in my nature i am a very matter of fact plain spoken being and may blunder on the borders of a for half an together without striking it out a general silence succeeded was thoughtful made the first interruption by saying i wonder that i should be tired with only walking in this sweet wood bat the next time we come to a seat if it is not disagreeable to you i should be glad to sit down for a little while my dear cried â immediately drawing her arm within his how thoughtless i have been i hope you are not very tired perhaps turning to miss my other companion may do me the honour of taking ao arm thank you but i am not at all tired she took it however as she spoke and the gratification of having her do so of feeling such a connection for the first time him a little forgetful of you t d m o park â or fashion he must not head or set the but i cannot call that situation nothing the charge of all that is of the first importance to ma or considered which has the of religion and i and consequently of the manners which result influence no one here can call the office nothing man who holds it is so it is by the neglect of his du foregoing its just importance and stepping out of to appear what he ought not to appear you greater consequence to the one has been used to hear given or than i can quite one does not see much of this importance in society and how can it be acquired they are so seldom seen themselves how can two sc a week even supposing them worth hearing preacher to have the sense to prefer s to his ov all that you speak of govern the conduct and manners of a large congregation for the rest of the one scarcely sees a clergyman out of his pulpit you are speaking of london i am speaking nation at large the metropolis i imagine is a pretty fair san the rest not i should hope of the proportion of virtue throughout the kingdom we do not look in for our best morality it is not there that people of any can do most good and is not there that the influence of the clergy most felt a fine preacher is followed and admire it is not in fine preaching only that a good be useful in his parish and his neighbourhood wh parish and neighbourhood are of a size capable of ki his private character and observing his general which in london can rarely be the case the lost there in the crowds of their tl known to the largest part only as an regard to their public manners miss cr must not me or suppose i mean to the of good breeding the of park s how abominable in you then to let me ss her horse as i did all last week i am ashamed of you and of but it shall never happen again your and consideration make me more sensible of my own neglect s interest seems in safer hands with you 
37,than with me that she should be tired now however gives me no for there is nothing in the course of one s duties as what we have been doing this morning â seeing a great house from one room to another â straining one s eyes and one s attention â hearing what one does not understand â admiring what one does not care it is generally allowed to be the greatest bore in the world and miss price has found it so though she did not know it i shall soon be rested said to sit in the on a fine day and look upon is the most perfect refreshment after sitting a little while miss was up again i must move said she resting me i have looked across the ha ha till i am weary i must go and look through that iron gate at the same view without being able to see it so well left the seat likewise now miss if you will look up the walk you will convince yourself that it cannot be half a mile long or half half a mile it is an immense distance she i see with t glance he still reasoned with her but in vain she would not calculate she would not compare she would only smile the greatest degree of rational not have been more engaging and they talked with mutual satisfaction at last it was agreed that they should endeavour to determine the dimensions of the wood by talking a little more about it they would go to one end of it in the line they were then in for there was a straight green walk along the bottom by the side of the ha ha and perhaps turn a little way in some other direction if it seemed likely to assist them and be back in a few minutes she was rested and have moved too i â was not her where she was with an which she not resist and she was left on the to think with of her cousin s care hut with great r that she was not stronger she them till they had tamed the corner and listened till an of them had ceased chapter x a quarter of an twenty minutes passed away and was still thinking of miss and herself without interruption from any one she began to be surprised at left so long and to listen with an anxious desire of hearing their steps and their voices again she listened and at length she heard she heard voices and approaching but she had just satisfied herself that it was not those she wanted when miss mr and mr issued from the same path which she had trod herself and were before her miss price all alone and my dear bow comes this were the first she told her story poor dear cried her cousin how ill you ha e been used by them i you had better have staid with us then herself with a gentleman on each side she resumed the conversation which had engaged them before and discussed the possibility of improvements with much animation nothing was fixed on â but henry was full of ideas and projects and generally speaking whatever he proposed was immediately approved first by her and then by mr whose principal business to be to hear the others and who scarcely risked an original thought of his own beyond a wish that they had seen his friend smith s place after some minutes spent in this way miss serving the iron gate expressed a wish of passing through it into the park that their views and their plans might be more comprehensive it was the very thing of all others to park be wished it was the best it was the only way of proceeding with any advantage in henry s opinion and he directly saw a not half a mile off which would give exactly the requisite command of the house go therefore must to that and through that gate die gate was locked mr wished he had the key he had been very near thinking whether be should not bring the key he was determined he would ne er come without the key again but still this did not the present evil they could not get through and as miss s inclination for so doing did by no means lessen it ended in mr s declaring outright that he would go and fetch the key he set off accordingly it is undoubtedly the best thing we can do now as we are â from the house already said mr when he was gone tes there is nothing else to be done but now sincerely do not you find the place altogether worse than you expected no indeed far otherwise i find it better more complete in its style though that style may not be the best and to tell you the truth speaking rather lower i do not think that shall ever see again with k much pleasure as i do now another summer will hardly improve it to me after a moment s embarrassment the lady replied you are too much a man of the world not to see with the eyes of the world if other people think improved i have no doubt that you i am afraid i am not quite so much the man of the as might be good for me in some points my logs are not quite so nor my memory of the past under such easy dominion as one finds to be the case with men of the world this was followed by a short silence miss began again you seemed to enjoy your drive here very much this morning i was glad to see you so well enter you and were laughing the whole way were we yes i believe we were but i have not the 
38,least recollection at what i believe was te a e park to her some ridiculous stories of an old irish groom of m uncle s your sister loves to laugh you think her more hearted than i am more easily amused he replied consequently know smiling better company i could not have hoped to entertain you with irish anecdotes during a ten mile drive naturally i believe i am as lively as but i ha f more to think of now you have undoubtedly â and there are situations in which very high spirits would your prospects however are too fair to justify want of spirits you have a very smiling scene before you do you mean literally or literally yes certainly die sun shines and the park very cheerful but that iron gate that ha ba ve me a feeling of restraint hardship i cannot get out as the said as she spoke and it was with expression she walked to the gate he followed her mr rush worth is so long this key and for the world you would not get out without the key and without mr s authority and protection or i think you might with little difficulty pass round the edge of the gate here with my assistance i think it might be done if you wished to be more at and could allow yourself to think it not nonsense i certainly can get out that way and i will mr will be here in a moment you know â we shall not be out of sight or if we are miss price will be so good as to tell him that he will find us near that the grove of oak on th feeling all this to be wrong could not help making an effort to prevent it you will hurt yourself miss she cried you will certainly hurt yourself against those â you will tear your gown â you will be in danger of slipping into the ha ha you had better not go her cousin was safe on the other side white these words were spoken and smiling with all the good humour of park she said thank you my dear hut i and my gown are alive and well and so good hy was again left to her solitude and with no increase of pleasant feelings for she was sorry for almost all that she had seen and heard astonished at miss and angry with mr by taking a and as it appeared to her very unreasonable direction to the ey were soon beyond her eye and for some longer she remained without sight or sound of any companion she seemed to have the little wood all to her i self she could almost have thought that and miss had left it but that it was impossible for to forget her so entirely she was again roused from disagreeable by den footsteps somebody was coming at a quick pace down the principal walk she expected mr but it was who hot and out of breath and with a look of disappointment cried out on seeing her where are the others i thought maria and mr were with you explained a pretty trick upon my word i cannot see them any where looking eagerly into the park but they can not be very far off and i think i am equal to to much as maria even without help but mr will be here in a moment with the key do wait for mr not i indeed i have had enough of the family for one morning child i have but this moment escaped from his horrible mother such a penance as i have been enduring while you were sitting here so composed and so happy it might have been as weu perhaps if you had been in my place but you always contrive to keep out of these this was a most unjust reflection but could al low for it and let it pass was vexed and her per was hasty but she felt that it would not last and therefore taking no notice only asked her if she had not seen mr yes yes we saw him he was away as il park upon life and deaths and could but just spare time to us his errand and where you all were it is a pity that he have so much trouble i nothing that is miss maria s concern i am not obliged to myself for her sins the mother i could not as loi as my tiresome aunt was dancing about with the keeper but the son i can get away from and she immediately scrambled across the fence ai walked away not attending to s last question whether she had seen any thing of miss and â the sort of in which now sat seeing mr prevented her thinking so much their continued absence however as she might have she felt that he had been very ill used and was quite u happy in having to communicate what had passed joined her within five minutes after s exit and she made the best of the story he was evidently and displeased in no common degree at first he said any thing his looks only expressed his extreme and vexation and he walked to the gate and there without seeming to know what to do they desired me to stay â my cousin maria me to say that you would find them at that or i do not believe i shall go any further said he si i see nothing of them by the time i get to they may be gone somewhere else i have h walking enough and he sat down with a most gloomy countenance i am very sorry said she it is very and she longed to be able to say something more to t purpose after an interval of silence i think they 
38,might as w have for me said he miss thought you would follow her i should not have had to follow her if she had this could not be denied and was silenced af another pause he went on â pâ y miss price are y i a great admirer of this mr as some people are for my part i can see in him i do not think him at all handsome handsome can call such an under sized man he is not five foot nine i should not won der if he was not more than five foot eight i think he is an ill looking fellow in my opinion these are no addition at all we did very well without them a small sigh escaped here and she did not know how to contradict him if i had made any difficulty the key there might have heen some excuse hut i went the v y moment she said she wanted it nothing could be more obliging than your manner i am sure and i dare say you walked as as you could int still it is some distance you know from this ot to the house quite into the house and when people are waiting they are bad judges of time and every half minute like five he got up and walked to the gate again and wished he had had the key about him at the time thought the discerned in his standing there an indication of which encouraged her to another attempt and she said therefore it is a pity you should not join them they expected to have a better view of the house from that of die park and will be thinking how it may be im proved and nothing of that sort you know can be settled without you she found herself more successful in sending away than in retaining a companion mr was worked on well said he if you really think i had better go it would be to bring the key for nothing and let ting himself out he walked off without further ceremony s thoughts were now all engrossed by the who had left her so long ago and getting quite impatient resolved to go in search of them she followed their steps along the bottom walk and had just turned up into when the voice and the laugh of miss once more caught her ear the sound approached and a few more brought them before park just returned into the wilderness from the park to i side gate not fastened had tempted them very their leaving her and they had heen across a into the very avenue which had heen die whole morning to reach at last and had heen down under one of the trees this was their was evident that they had heen spending their tin and were not aware of the length of their a s best consolation was in being assured that â had wished for her very much and that he should o have come back for her had she not been tired a but this was not quite sufficient to do away the having been left a whole hour when he had talked a few minutes nor to banish the sort of curiosity s to know what they had been conversing about all tha and the result of the whole was to her depression as they prepared by general agreement turn to the house on reaching the bottom of the steps to the l and mrs presented themselves top just ready for the wilderness at the end of a and a half from their leaving the house mrs been too well employed to move faster accidents had occurred to the pleasures she had found a morning of complete for the housekeeper after a great many subject of had taken her to the t all about their cows and given her the receipt for a cream cheese and since s leaving them th been met by the gardener with whom she had most satisfactory acquaintance for she had set him to his s illness convinced him it was ai and promised him a charm for it and he in shown her all his nursery of plants and s presented her with a very curious specimen of on this they all returned to the house to there to away the time as they could with chat and till the return others and the arrival of dinner it was late miss and the two gentlemen came in an did not appear to have been more than ble or at all productive of any thing useful with re the object of the day by their own accounts they en all walking after each other and the had taken place at last seemed to s to have been as much too late for re ny as it had been for on she felt as she looked at and mn p that hers was not the only dissatisfied bosom st them there was gloom on the face of each mr and miss were much more gay and she it that he was taking particular pains during dinner any little resentment of the other two and re good humour ner was soon followed by tea and coffee a ten miles allowed no waste of hours and from the time of down to table it was a quick succession of till the carriage came to the door and mrs having about and obtained a few eggs and a cream cheese from the housekeeper and of civil speeches to mrs rush worth was to lead the way at the same moment mr said i hope i am not to lose my unless she is afraid of the evening air in d a seat the request had not been foreseen but ry graciously received and s day was likely to as well as it began miss had made mind to something

go to church twice every sunday and preach such very good sermons in good a manner as he does without being the better for it himself it must make him think and i have no doubt that he oftener to restrain himself than he would if he had been any thing but a clergyman we cannot prove the contrary to be u l j you a better fate miss price than to be the wife of a man whose depends upon his own

fortnight â a fortnight of such to the miss as ought to have put them both on their guard and made even admit in her jealousy of her sister the absolute necessity of his attentions and wishing him not to return and a fortnight of leisure 
39,in the intervals of shooting and sleeping to have convinced the gentleman that he ought to keep longer away had he been more in the habit of examining his own mo and of reflecting to what the indulgence of his idle vanity was tending but thoughtless and selfish from prosperity and bad example he would not look beyond the present moment the sisters handsome clever and encouraging were an amusement to his mind and finding nothing in to equal the social pleasures of he gladly returned to it at the time appointed and was welcomed thither quite as gladly by those whom he came to trifle with farther maria with only mr to attend to her and doomed to the repeated details of his day s sport good or bad his boast of his dogs his jealousy of his neighbours his doubts of their and his zeal after â subjects which will not find their way to female feelings some talent on one side or some attachment on the other â had missed mr and and felt all the right of missing him much more each sister believed herself the favourite might be justified in so doing by the hints of mrs inclined to credit what she wished and maria by the park hints of mr himself every thing returned into the same channel as his his manners being to each so animated and agreeable as to lose no ground with either and just stopping short of the the the solicitude and the warmth which might excite general notice was the only one of the party who found any thing to dislike hut since the day at she could never see mr with either sister without observation and seldom without wonder or censure and had her in her own judgment been equal to her exercise it in every other respect had she been sure that she was seeing dearly and judging candidly she would probably have made some important communications to her usual as it was however she only a hint and the hint was lost i am rather surprised said she that mr should come back again so soon after being here so long before full seven weeks for i had understood he was so very fond of change and moving about that i thought something would certainly occur when he was once gone to take him elsewhere he is used to places than it is to his credit was s answer and i dare say it gives his sister pleasure she does not like his unsettled habits what a favourite he is with my cousins yes his manners to women are such as must please mrs i believe him of a preference for i have never seen much symptom of it but i wish it may be so he has no faults but what a serious attachment would remove if miss were not engaged said cautiously i could sometimes almost think that he admired her more than which is perhaps more in favour of his liking best than you may be aware for i believe it often happens that a man before he has quite made up his own mind will distinguish the sister or intimate friend of the woman he is really thinking of more than the man herself has too much to i t m h van park he found in any danger from maria and i ai not at all afraid for her after such a proof as she has that her feelings are not strong supposed she must have heen mistaken and meant to think differently in future hut with all that mission to could do and all the help of the coin looks and hints which she occasionally noticed in some of the others and which seemed to say that was mr s choice she knew not always what to think she was one evenings to the hopes of her aunt on this as well as to her feelings and the feelings of mrs on a point of some and could not help wondering as she listened and glad would she have heen not to he to listen for it was while all the other young people were and she most unwillingly among the at the longing for the re entrance of her elder cousin on whom all her own hopes of a partner then depended it wai s first though without the preparation or splendour of many a young lady s first hall being the thou only of the afternoon built on the late acquisition of t player in the servants hall and the possibility of raising ve couple with the help of mrs grant and a new intimate friend of mn s just arrived on a it had however been a very happy one to through four dances and she was quite grieved to be losing even i quarter of an hour while waiting and wishing looking now at the dancers and now at the door this dialogue between the two above mentioned ladies was forced on her think ma am said mrs â her eyes towards mr and maria who were partners foi the second time â we shall see some happy faces now yes ma am indeed replied the other with a there will be some satisfaction in looking o now and i think it was rather a pity they should have obliged to part young folks in their situation should b excused with the common forms i my son did not propose it j dare say he did ma am n ss ta is but dear maria has such a strict sense of pro â so much of that true delicacy which one meets with now a days mrs that wish of avoiding dear ma am only look at her face at this moment how different from what it was the two last dances miss did indeed look happy her eyes were sparkling with pleasure and she was 
39,speaking with great animation for and her partner mr were close to her they were all in a cluster together how she had looked could not recollect for she had been dancing with herself and had not thought her mrs continued it is quite delightful ma am to see young people so properly happy so well suited and much the thing i cannot but think of dear sir thomas s delight and what do you say ma am to the chance of another match mr has set a good example and such things are very catching mrs who saw nothing but her son was quite at a loss the couple above ma am po you see no symptoms there oh dear â miss and mr yes in deed a very pretty match what is his property four a year very weu those who have not more must be satisfied with what they have four thousand a year is a pretty estate and he seems a very genteel steady young man so i hope miss will be very happy it is not a settled thing ma am yet we only speak of it among friends but i have very little doubt it wiu be he is growing particular in his attentions could listen no farther listening and wondering were all suspended for a time for mr was in the room again and though feeling it would be a great honour to be asked by him she thought it must happen e came towards their little circle but instead of asking her to dance drew a chair near her and gave her an account of the present state of a sick horse at d l ie o vâ of the groom from whom he had just x â found that it was not to be and in the of her nature immediately felt that she had been unreasonable in expecting it when he had told of his horse he took a newspaper from the table and looking over it said in a languid way if you want to dance i will stand up with you with more than equal civility the offer waa declined she did not wish to dance i am glad of it said he in a much tone and throwing down the newspaper again â for i am tired to death i only wonder how the good people can keep it up so long they had need be a in love to find any amusement in such folly â and so they are i fancy if you look at them you may see they are so many couple of lovers â all but and mrs grant â and between ourselves she poor woman must want a lover as much as any one of a desperate dull life hers must be with the doctor making a sly face as he spoke towards the chair of uie latter who proving however to be close at his elbow made a change of expression and subject as in spite of every thing could hardly help laughing at a strange business this in america dr grant is your opinion i always come to you to know what i am to think of public matters my dear tom cried his aunt soon afterwards as you are not dancing i dare say you will have no objection to join us in a rubber shall you â then leaving her and coming to him to enforce the proposal added in i whisper we want to make a table for mrs you know your mother is quite anxious about it but cannot very well spare time to sit down herself because of her fringe now you and i and dr grant will just do and though we play but half crowns you know you may bet half guineas with him i should be most happy replied he aloud and jump ing up with alacrity it would give me the greatest plea sure â but that i am this moment going to dance come taking her hand do not be any longer or the dance will be over was led off very willingly though it was for her to feel much gratitude to iâ iâ t ot as he certainly did between the selfishness o another person and his own a pretty modest request upon my word he exclaimed as they walked away to want to nail me to a card table for the next two hours with herself and dr who are always quarrelling and that old woman who knows no more of than of i wish my good aunt would be a little less busy and to ask me in such a way too without ceremony before them all so as to leave me no possibility of refusing that is what i dislike most particularly it raises my more than any thing to have the pretence of being asked of being given a choice and at the same time addressed in such a way as to oblige one to do the very thing â ever it be if i had not luckily thought of standing up with you i could not have got out of it it is a great too bad but when my aunt has got a fancy in her nothing can stop her chapter the honourable john this new friend had not much to recommend him beyond habits of fashion and expense and being the younger son of a lord with a independence and sir thomas would probably have thought his introduction at by no means mr s acquaintance with him had begun at where they had spent ten days together in the same society and the friendship if friendship it might be called had been proved and by mr s being invited to take in his way whenever he could and by his promising to come and he did come rather earlier than had been expected in consequence of the breaking up of 
39,a large party assembled for gaiety at the house of another friend which he had left mouth to join he came on the wings of disappointment park and with his head full of for it had heen a party and the play in which he had home a within two days of representation when the of one of the nearest connections of the family had the scheme and dispersed the to h happiness so near fame so near the long praise of the private at tht the right hon lord in of course have the whole party for and so near to lose it all injury to he keenly felt and mr could talk o â and its theatre with its and dresses and jokes was his and to of the past his only happily for him a love of the theatre is so ge for acting so strong among young people hardly out talk the interest of his hearers first casting of the parts to the it wa and there were few who did not wish heen a party concerned or would have hesitate their skill the play had heen lovers vows and i was to have been count a trifling part and not at all to my taste and such a one as i would not accept again but i was determined to difficulties lord and the duke had the only two characters worth playing before i and though lord offered to i to me it was impossible to take it you know i i for him that he should have so mistaken his was no more equal to the baron â a little man weak voice always hoarse after the first ten must have injured the piece materially but was to make no difficulties sir henry thought the equal to but that was because sir the part himself whereas it was certainly in the b of the two i was surprised to see sir henry sue luckily the strength of the piece did not depend u our was and the duke was great by many and upon the whole it would have gone off wonderfully field park it was a hard case upon my word and i d you were very much to be pitied â were the kind uses of listening sympathy it is not worth complaining about but to be sure the ir old could not have died at a worse time and is impossible to help wishing that the news could hate n suppressed for just the three days we wanted it was t three days and being only a grandmother and au two hundred miles off i think there would hare n no great harm and it was suggested i know but who i suppose is one of the most correct in â would not hear of it j an after piece instead of a comedy said mr lovers vows were at an end and lord and lady left to act my grandmother by themselves well the may comfort him and perhaps between he began to tremble for his credit and his lungs in the baron and was not sorry to withdraw and to make amends i think we must raise a little theatre at and ask you to be our manager this though the thought of the moment did not end with the moment for the inclination to act was awakened and in no one more strongly than in him who was now master of the house and who having so much leisure as make almost any novelty a certain good had likewise such a degree of talents and comic taste as were exactly adapted to the novelty of acting the thought returned again and again oh for the â theatre and scenery to try something with â sister could echo the wish and henry to whom in all the riot of his it was yet an pleasure was quite alive at the idea i really believe said he i be fool enough at this moment to undertake any character that ever was written from or richard iii down to the singing hero of a farce in his scarlet coat and cocked hat i feel as if i could be any thing or every thing as if i could and storm or sigh or cut in any tragedy or comedy in the english language let us be doing something be it only half a play â an act â a scene what should prevent us not these park i am i looking towards the miss and f a theatre what a theatre we shall he on amusing ourselves any room in this house might suffice we must have a curtain said tom a f yards of green for a curtain and perhaps that m he enough oh quite enough cried mr with only ji a side wing or two run up doors in flat and three or fo scenes to he let down nothing more would he on such a plan as this for mere amusement among ov selves we should want nothing more i we must be satisfied with less said mar there would not be time and other difficulties arise we must rather adopt mr s views a make the performance not the theatre our object ma parts of our best plays are independent of scenery nay said who began to listen with let us do nothing by if we are to act let it in a theatre completely fitted up with pit box and and let us have a play entire from beginning to end so it be a german play no matter what with a good shifting after piece and a figure dance and a a a song between the acts if we do not we do nothing now do not be disagreeable said nobody loves a play better than you do or can hi gone much farther to see one true to see real acting good hardened 
40,real but i would hardly walk from this room to the next look at the raw of those who have not been bred the trade â a set of gentlemen and ladies who have the of education and decorum to through after a short pause however the subject still and was discussed with eagerness every on inclination increasing by the discussion and a of the inclination of the rest and though nothing v settled but that tom would prefer a comedy a his sisters and henry a tragedy and that in the world could be easier than to find a piece j an f ill please them all the resolution to act or ther seemed so decided as to make quite he was determined to prevent it if possible his mother who equally heard the conversation passed at table did not the least the same evening afforded him an opportunity of trying lis strength maria henry and mr in the room tom returning from them into he drawing room where was standing by the fire while lady was on the sofa at a distance and close beside her arranging her thus began as he entered â such a horribly vile table as ours is not to be net with i believe above ground i can stand it no and i think i may say that nothing shall ever me to it again â but one good thing i have just it is the very room for a theatre precisely the and length for it and the doors at the farther end with each other as they may be made to lo in five minutes by merely moving the in my s room is the very thing we could have desired if ire had set down to wish for it and my father s room be an excellent green room it seems to join the room on purpose you are not serious tom in meaning to act said in a low voice as his brother approached the fire not serious never more so i assure you what is here to surprise you in it i think it would be very wrong in a general light private are open to some objections but as we ire i must think it would be highly and more than to attempt any thing f the kind it would show great want of feeling on my s account absent as he is and in some degree of x danger and it would be i think with regard to maria whose situation is a very delicate one every thing extremely delicate you take up a thing so seriously i as if we were to act three times a week till my father s return and invite all the country but it is not to be a that sort we mean nothing but a little ourselves just to vary the scene and exercise o in something new we want no audience no we may be trusted i think in choosing some perfectly and i can conceive i harm or danger to any of us in conversing in tl language of some respectable author than in words of our own i have no fears and no and as to my father s being absent it is so objection that i consider it rather as a motive expectation of his return must be a very anxious my mother and if we can be the means of ami anxiety and keeping up her spirits for the i shall think our time very well spent and so he it is a very anxious period for her as he said this each looked towards lady sunk back in one comer of the picture of health wealth ease and tranquillity falling into a dose while was the few difficulties of her work for her smiled and shook his head by jove this won t do cried tom â into a chair with a hearty laugh to be dear mother your anxiety â i was unlucky ther what is the matter asked her in tone of one half roused â i was not asleep oh dear no ma am â nobody well â he continued returning to tl subject posture and voice as soon as lady to nod again but this i will maintain be doing no harm i cannot agree with you â i am father would totally it â and i am convinced to the contrary of the exercise of talent in young it more than my father and for any thi acting kind i think he has taste i am sure he encouraged it in us as bo many a time have mourned over the dead park s and to not to he d in this very room for his amusement and i am sure my name was every evening of my life through one christmas holidays it was a very different thing you must see the difference yourself my father wished us as to well hut he would never wish his grown up daughters to be acting plays his sense of decorum is strict i know all that said tom displeased i know father as well as you do and i take care that his daughters do nothing to distress him manage your own and i ll take care of the rest of the family if you are resolved on acting replied the â i must hope it will be in a very small and way and i think a theatre ought not to be attempted it would be taking liberties with my father s house in his absence which could not be justified for every thing of that nature i will be said tom in a decided tone his house shall not be hurt i have quite as great an interest in being careful of his house as you can have and as to such alterations a i was suggesting just now such as moving a or a door or 
40,even as using the room for the space of a week without playing at in it might just as well suppose he would object to our sitting more in this room and less in the breakfast room than we did before he went or to my sister s piano being moved from one side of the room to the other absolute nonsense the if not wrong as an will be wrong as an expense yes the expense of such an undertaking would be prodigious perhaps it cost a whole twenty pounds something of a theatre we must have but it will be on the simplest plan a green curtain and a little carpenter s and that s all and as the carpenter s work may be all done at home by himself it will be too absurd to talk of expense and as long as ia employed every thing will be right with sir thomas don t imagine that nobody in this park house can see or judge but yourself don t act yourself if you do not like it but don t expect to govern every body else no as to acting myself said that i absolutely protest against tom walked out of the room as he said it and was left to sit down and stir the fire in thoughtful vexation who had heard it au and borne company in every feeling throughout the whole now to say in her anxiety to suggest some comfort they may not be able to find any play to suit them your brother s taste and your sisters seem very different i have no hope there if they persist in the scheme they will find something i shall speak to my sisters and try to them and that is all i can do i should think my aunt would be on your side i dare say she would but she has no influence with either tom or my sisters that could be of any use and if cannot convince them myself i shall let things take their course without attempting it through her family is the greatest evil of all and we had better do any thing than be altogether by the ears his sisters to whom he had an opportunity of speaking the next mornings were quite as impatient of his advice quite as to his representation quite as determined in the cause of pleasure as tom their mother had no objection to the plan and they were not in the least afraid of their father s there could be no harm in what had been done in so many respectable families and by so many women of the first consideration and it must be run mad that could see any thing to censure in a plan like theirs only brothers and sisters and intimate friends and which would never be heard of beyond themselves did seem inclined to admit that maria s situation might require particular caution and delicacy â but that could not extend to her â she was at liberty and maria evidently considered her engagement as only raising her so much more above restraint and leaving her less occasion than to consult either father ox mother had little to hope but he was still subject henry entered the room om the parson e calling out no want of hands miss no want of under r desires her love and hopes to be admitted into the and will be happy to take the part of any old or tame that you may not hke to do a gave â a glance which meant what l now can we be wrong if mary feels le and silenced was obliged to that the charm of acting might well carry f the mind of genius and with the ingenuity of dwell more on the obliging message than on any thing else scheme advanced opposition was and as he was mistaken in supposing she would make any she started no difficulties that were down in ve minutes by her eldest nephew and were au with her and as the whole was to bring very little expense to any body ne at all to herself as she foresaw in it au the hurry bustle and importance and derived the advantage of herself obliged to leave her use where she had been living a month at her own nd take up her abode in theirs that every hour be spent in their service she was in fact with the project chapter xiv r seemed nearer being right than had sup the business of finding a play that would suit body proved to be no trifle and the carpenter had id his orders and taken his had and removed at least two sets of difficulties and made the of an of â i l i park expense fully evident was already at work while a was still to seek other preparations were also in hand an enormous roll of green had arrived from and heen cut out hy mrs with a by her good management of full three quarters of a yard nd was actually forming into a curtain by the and still the play was wanting and as two or three days passed away in this manner â began almost to hope that none might ever be found there were in fact so many things to be attended to so many people to be pleased so many best characters required and above all such a need that the play should be at once both tragedy and comedy that there did seem as little chance of a decision as any thing pursued by s nd zeal could hold out on the tragic side were the miss henry and mr on the comic tom not quite alone because it was evident that mary s wishes though politely kept back inclined the same way but his and his power seemed to make unnecessary and independent of this 
40,great difference they wanted a piece containing very few characters in the whole but every character first rate and three principal women all the best plays were run over in vain neither hamlet nor nor nor nor the presented any thing that could satisfy even the and the rivals the school for scandal wheel of fortune heir at law and a long et were dismissed with yet warmer objections no piece could be proposed that did not supply somebody with a difficulty and on one side or the other it was a continual repetition of oh no that will never do let us have no too many characters not a tolerable woman s part in the play any thing but my dear tom it would be impossible to fill it up one could not expect any body to take such a part nothing but from beginning to end that might do perhaps but for the low parts if i must give my opinion i have always thought it the most play in the english language do not wish to make shall be happy to be of any use but i think we could not choose worse looked on and listened not to observe the selfishness which more or less disguised seemed to them all and wondering how it would end for her own gratification she could have wished that something might be acted for she had never seen even half a play bat every thing of higher consequence was against it this will never do said tom at last we wasting time most something must be fixed on no matter what so that something is chosen we must not be so nice a few characters too many mu t not frighten us we must double them we must descend a little if a part is insignificant the greater our credit in making any of it from this moment make no difficulties i take any part you choose to give me so as it be comic let it but be comic i condition for nothing more for about the fifth time he then proposed the heir at law doubting only whether to prefer lord or dr for himself and very earnestly but very trying to persuade the others that there fine tragic parts in the rest of the the pause which followed this fruitless effort was ended l y the same speaker who taking up one of the many vo of plays that lay on the table and turning it exclaimed â lovers vows and why should not lovers vows do for us as well as for the how can e it never to be thought of before it strikes me as if it would do exactly what say you all here ar two capital tragic parts for and and here is the for me â if nobody else wants it â a trifling part but the sort of thing i should not dislike and i said before i am determined to take any thing and do my best and as for the rest they may be filled up by ny body it is only count and the suggestion was generally welcome every body waa growing weary of and the first idea with every was that nothing had been proposed before so likely tp suit them all mr was particularly pleased ha x had been sighing to do the baron at had every of lord s and been forced to re it all in bis own room the storm through baron was the height of his theatrical ambition and with the advantage of knowing half the by heart already he did now with the greatest alacrity bis services for the part to do him justice however he did not resolve to appropriate it â for remembering that there was some very good ground in he professed an equal for that henry was ready to take either whichever mr did not choose would perfectly satisfy him and a short of compliment ensued miss feeling all the interest of an in the question took on her to decide it by observing to mr that this was a point in which height and figure ought to be considered and that his being the seemed to fit him peculiarly for the baron she was acknowledged to be quite right and the two parts being accepted accordingly she was certain of the proper three oi the characters were now cast besides mr was always answered for by maria as to do any thing when meaning like bet sister to be began to be scrupulous on miss s account this is not well by the absent said she here are not women enough and may do for maria and me but here is nothing for your mr mr desired that might not be thought of he was very sure his sister had no wish of acting but as she might be useful and that she would not allow herself to be considered in the present case but this was immediately opposed by tom who asserted the part of to be in every respect the property of miss if she would accept it it falls as naturally as necessarily â to her said he as does to one or other of my it can be no sacrifice on their side for it is highly comic a v short silence followed each sister looked anxious for felt the best claim to and was hoping t park ive it pressed on her by the rest henry who bad taken up the play and with seeming careless was over the first act soon settled the i must entreat miss said he not to in the part of or it will be the ruin of all ly solemnity you must not indeed you must not to her i could not stand your countenance up in woe and the many laughs we had together would come across me and and his would be 
40,obliged to run away pleasantly courteously it was spoken but the manner was lost in the matter to s feelings she saw a glance it maria which confirmed the injury to herself it was a â a trick she was maria was preferred e smile of triumph which maria was trying to suppress showed how well it was understood and before could command herself enough to speak her brother gave his weight against her too by saying oh yes maria must be maria will be the best though fancies she prefers tragedy i would not her in it there is nothing of tragedy about her she has not the look of it her features are not tragic features and she walks too quick and speaks too quick and would not keep her countenance she had better do the old â the s wife j you had indeed s wife is a very pretty part i assure you the old lady the high flown benevolence of her husband with a good deal of spirit you shall be s wife s wife cried mr what are you talking of the most trivial paltry insignificant part the merest common place â not a tolerable speech in the your sister do that it is an insult to propose it at the was to have done it we all agreed that it could not be ofi to any body else a more justice mr manager if you please you do not deserve the office if you cannot appreciate the talents of your company a little better why as to that my good friend till i and my company acted there be some g m tv j park but mean no to we cannot ha two and we must have one s wife a i am sure i set her the example of moderation myself being satisfied with the old butler if the part is she will have more credit in making something of it a if she is so desperately bent against every thing let her take s speeches instead of s wife and so change the parts all through is solemn and i enough i am sure it could make no difference the play and as for himself when he has his wife s speeches would undertake him with all i heart with all your partiality for s wife sâ henry it will be impossible to make a thing of it fit for your sister and we must not suffer good nature to be imposed on we must not allow her accept the part she must not be left to her own her talents will be wanted in is a character more difficult to be well represented than ev i consider as the most difficult in the whole piece it requires great powers great to give her and simplicity without i have seen good fail in the part simplicity i deed is beyond the reach of almost every i profession it requires a delicacy of feeling which th have not it requires a â a you will undertake it i hope turning to her with a loi of anxious entreaty which softened her a little but she hesitated what to say her brother again interposed wi miss s better claim no no must not be it is not at all tl part for her she would not uke it she would not well she is too tall and robust should be small light girlish figure it is fit for mi and miss only she looks the and i am persuaded will do it admirably without attending to this henry his you must oblige us said he ii deed you must when you have studied the character am sure you will feel it suit you tragedy may be but it will certainly appear that comedy you you will be to visit me in prison with a basket of io i you will not refuse to visit me in prison i l i see you coming in with your basket the influence of his voice was felt wavered mt was he only trying to soothe and her and make her overlook the previous she him the slight had been most determined he was perhaps at treacherous play with her she looked suspiciously at her sister maria s countenance was to decide it if she vexed and alarmed â but maria looked all serenity and satisfaction and well knew that on this ground maria could not be happy but at her expense with indignation therefore and a tremulous voice she said to him you do not seem afraid of not keeping your countenance when i come in with a basket of provisions â though one might have supposed â but it is only bs that i was to be so overpowering she stopped â henry looked rather foolish and as if he did not know what to say tom again â i miss must be she will be an lent do not be afraid of my wanting the character cried with angry quickness i am not to be and i am sure i will do nothing else and as to it is of all parts in the world the most disgusting to me i quite her an odious httle unnatural girl i have always protested against comedy and this is comedy in its worst form and so saying she walked hastily out of the room leaving awkward feelings to more than one but exciting small compassion in any except who had been a quiet of the whole und n ho could not think of her as under the of without great pity a short silence succeeded her leaving them but her brother soon returned to business and lovers vows and was eagerly looking over the play with mr s help to ascertain what scenery would be necessary â while and ji t ex v park under and the declaration with which she of i am sure i 
41,would give up the part to most hut that though i shall probably do it very ill i feel persuaded would do it worse was doubtless receiving all the compliments it called for when this had lasted some time the division of die party was completed by tom and mr walking off together to consult farther in the room now beginning to be called the theatre and miss s to go down to the herself with the offer of to miss and remained alone the first use she made of her solitude was to take up the volume which had been left on the table and begin to herself with the play of which she had heard so much her curiosity was all awake and she ran through it with an eagerness which was suspended only by interval of astonishment that it could be chosen in the present instance â that it could be proposed and accepted in a â ate theatre and appeared to her in their different ways so totally improper for home representation â the situation of one and the language of other so unfit to be expressed by any woman of modesty that she could hardly suppose her cousins could be aware of what they were engaging in and longed to have them roused as soon as possible by the remonstrance would certainly make chapter xv miss accepted the part very readily and soon after miss s return from the mr rush worth arrived and another character was consequently cast he had the offer of count and and at first did not know which to choose and wanted miss to direct him but upon being made to understand the style of the characters and i which and park that he had once seen the play in london and liad thought a very stupid fellow he soon decided for the count miss approved the decision for the less he had to learn the better and though she could not in his wish that the count and might be to act together nor wait very patiently while he was slowly turning over the leaves with the hope of still discovering such a scene she very kindly took his part in and every speech that admitted being besides pointing out the necessity of his being very much dressed and choosing his colours mr liked the idea of his finery very well though affect ing to despise it and was too much engaged with what his own appearance would be to think of the others or draw any of those conclusions or feel any of that displeasure which maria had been half prepared for thus much was settled before who had been out all the morning knew any thing of the matter but when be entered the drawing room before dinner the of discussion was high between tom maria and mr and mr stepped forward with eat alacrity to tell him the agreeable news we have got a play said he it is to be lovers vows and i am to be count and am to come in first with a blue dress and a pink satin cloak and after wards am to have another fine fancy suit by way of ft shooting dress i do not know how i shall like iv s eyes followed and her heart beat for him as she heard this speech and saw his look and felt what his sensations must be lovers vows in a tone of the greatest amazement was his only reply to mr and he turned towards his and sisters as if hardly doubting a con yes cried mr after all our and difficulties we find there is nothing that will suit us altogether so well nothing so as lovers vows the wonder is that it should not have been thought of before my stupidity was abominable for here we have ill the of what i saw at â s u f field useful to have any thing of a model we have cast almost every part but what do you do for women said gravely and looking at maria maria in spite of herself as she answered i take the part which lady was to have done and with a eye miss is to be i should not have thought it the sort of play to be so easily filled up with us replied turning away to the fire where sat his mother aunt and and himself with a look of great vexation mr followed him to say i come in three times and have two and forty speeches that s some thing is not it but i do not much like the idea of being so fine i shall hardly know myself in a blue dress and a pink satin cloak could not answer him in a few minutes mr was called out of the room to satisfy some doubts of the carpenter and being accompanied by and followed soon afterwards by mr almost immediately took the opportunity of i cannot before mr speak what i feel as to this play without reflecting on his friends at but i must now my dear maria tell u that i think it exceedingly unfit for private representation and that i hope you will give it up i cannot but suppose yoa will when you have read it carefully over read only the first act aloud to either your mother or aunt and see ho you can approve it it will not be necessary to send you to your o s judgment i am convinced we see things very differently cried maria i am perfectly acquainted with the play i assure you and with a very few and so forth which will be be made of course i can see nothing objectionable in it and am not the only young woman you find who it very fit for private representation i am sorry for it was his answer but in this 
41,matter it is you who are to lead vou must set the li others have it la your place to park right and show them what true delicacy is in all points of decorum your conduct must he law to the of the party this picture of her consequence had some effect for no one loved to lead than maria and with far more good humour she answered i am much to you â you mean very well i am sure hut i still you see things too strongly and i really cannot undertake to all the rest upon a subject of this kind there would he the greatest i think do you imagine that i could have such an idea in my bead no let your conduct he the only that on examining the part you feel yourself unto it that yoa find it requiring more exertion and confidence than you can he supposed to have say this with firmness and it will be quite enough all who can distinguish will understand your motive the play will he given up and your delicacy honoured as it ought do not act any thing improper my dear said lady sir thomas would not like it â ring the bell i must have my dinner â to be sure is dressed by this time i am convinced madam said preventing that sir thomas would not like it there my dear do you hear what says if i were to decline the part said maria with renewed zeal would certainly take it what i cried if she knew your reasons oh she might think the difference between us â the difference in our situations â that she need not be so scrupulous as might feel necessary i am sure she would argue so no you must excuse me i cannot my consent it is too far settled every body would be so disappointed tom would be quite angry and if we are so very we shall never act any thing i was just going to say the very same thing said mrs if every play is to be objected to you will act nothing and the preparations will be all so much money thrown away and i am sure that would be a to us all x o not know the play but a v ma field if there is any thing a little too warm and it is m with moat of them it can be easily left out we must not be over precise as mr is to act too there can be no harm i only wish tom had known his own mind when the began for was the of half a day s work about those side the will be a good job however the maids do their work vary well and i we shall be able to send back some of the rings there is no occasion to put them so very dose together i am of some use i hope in preventing waste and making the most of things there should always be one steady head to so many young ones i for t to tell tom of something that happened to me this very day i had been about me in the poultry yard and was just coming out when who should i see but dick making up to the servants hall door with two bits of deal board in his hand bringing them to father you may be sure mother had chanced to send him of a message to father and then father had bid him bring up them two bits of board for he could not no how do without them i knew what all this meant for the servants dinner bell was ringing at the very moment over our heads and as i hate such people the are very i have always said so â just the sort of people to get all they can i said to the boy directly a great fellow of ten years old you know who ought to be ashamed of himself i li take the boards to your father dick so get you home again as fast as you can the boy looked very and turned away without offering a word for i believe i might speak pretty sharp and i dare say it will cure him of coming about the house for one while i hate such â so good as your father is to the family the man all the year round nobody was at the trouble of an answer the others soon returned and found that to have to set them right must be his only dinner passed heavily mrs related her triumph over dick but neither nor preparation were otherwise much talked of for s dis park was felt even by his brother he would lot have owned it maria wanting henry s support thought the subject better avoided mr who was trying to make himself agreeable to pound her gloom less impenetrable on any topic than that â f his regret at her from their company and mr having only his own part and his own dress in bis head had soon talked away all that could be said of either but the concerns of the theatre were suspended only for an hour or two there was still a great deal to be settled and the spirits of evening giving fresh courage tom ma and mr soon after their being re assembled in the drawing room seated themselves in committee at a separate table with the play open before them and were just getting deep in the subject when a most welcome interruption was given by the entrance of mr and miss who late and dark and dirty as it was could not help coming and were received with the most grateful toy well how do you go on and what have you settled and oh we can do nothing without you

42,nerves still agitated by the shock of such an attack from her tom so public and so in and her spirits under her aunt s unkind reflection and reproach to be called into notice in such a manner to hear that it was but the to something so infinitely worse to be told that she must do what was so impossible as to act and thai to have the charge of obstinacy and ingratitude follow it enforced with such a hint at the dependence of her situation had been too distressing at the time to make the remembrance when she was alone much less so â especially with the dread of what the morrow might produce in of the subject miss ford had protected her only for the time and if she were applied to again among themselves with all the that tom and maria were capable of and perhaps away what should she do

family proving tent to suggest any reply she had recourse as soon as she was dressed to another apartment more lo i k park meet for walking about in and of she bad now for some time been almost equally mistress it p had been their school room so called till the miss ber would not allow it to be called so any longer and inhabited as such to a later period there miss lee had and there they had read and written and talked and laughed till within the last three years when she had quitted them the room had then become useless and for some time was quite deserted except by when she visited her plants or wanted one of the books which she was still glad to keep there from the deficiency of space and accommodation in her little chamber above but gradually as her value for the comforts of it increased she had added to her possessions and spent more of her time there and having nothing to oppose her had so naturally and so worked herself into it that it was now generally admitted to be hers the east room as it had been ever since maria was sixteen was now considered s almost as decidedly as the white the of the one making the use of the other so evidently reasonable that the miss with every superiority in their own apartments which their own sense of superiority could demand were entirely it and mrs having for there never being a fire in it on s account was tolerably resigned to her having the use of what nobody else wanted though the terms in which she sometimes spoke of the indulgence seemed to imply that it was the best room in the house the aspect was so favourable that even without a fire it was in many an early spring and late autumn mornings to such a willing mind as s and while there was a gleam of sunshine she hoped not to be driven from it entirely even when winter came the comfort of it in her hours of leisure was extreme she could go there after any thing unpleasant below and find immediate consolation in some pursuit or some train of thought at hand her plants her books â of which she had been a from the first hour of her commanding a â her writing desk and et â oi l ot and park ingenuity were all within her reach or if for employment if nothing but musing would do she could scarcely see an in that room which had not an resting remembrance connected with it every thing was a friend or bore her thoughts to a friend and though there had been sometimes much of suffering to her â though her motives had been often misunderstood her feelings disregarded and her comprehension â though she had known the pains of tyranny of ridicule and neglect â yet almost every of either had led to something her aunt had spoken for her or miss lee had been encouraging or what was yet more frequent or more dear â had been her champion and her friend â he had supported her cause or explained her meaning he had told her not to cry or had given her some proof of affection which made her tears delightful â and the whole was now so blended tor so by distance that every former affliction had its charm the room was most dear to her and she would not have changed its furniture for the in the house though what had been originally plain had suffered

42,so strongly wished for what might be so to a scheme on which some of those to whom she owed the greatest had set their hearts was it not ill nature â selfishness â and a fear of ing herself and would â s judgment would his persuasion of sir thomas s of the whole be enough to justify her in a determined denial in spite of all the rest it would be so horrible to her to act that she was inclined to suspect the truth and purity of her own scruples and as she looked around her the claims of her cousins to being obliged were strengthened by the sight of present upon present that she had received from them the table between the windows was covered with work boxes and boxes which had been given her at different times principally by tom and she grew bewildered as to the amount of the debt which all these kind produced a tap at the door roused her in the midst of this attempt to find her way to her duty and her gentle come in was answered by the appearance of one before whom all her doubts were wont to be laid her eyes brightened at the sight of can i speak with you for a few minutes said he yes certainly i want to consult â i want your opinion my opinion she cried shrinking from such a compliment highly as it gratified her yes your advice and opinion i do not know what to do this acting scheme gets worse and worse yon see they have chosen almost as bad a play as they could and now to complete the business are going to ask the help of a young man very slightly known to any of us this is the end of all the privacy and propriety which was talked about at first i know no harm of charles but the excessive intimacy which must spring from his being admitted among us in this manner is highly objectionable the more than intimacy â the familiarity i cannot think of it with any patience and it does appear to me an evil of such magnitude as must if possible be prevented do not you see it in the same light yes but what can be done your brother is so determined there is but one thing to be done i must take myself i am well aware that nothing else will quiet tom could not answer him it is not at all what i like he continued no man can like being driven into the appearance of such after being known to oppose the scheme from the beginning there is absurdity in the face of my joining them now when they are exceeding their first plan in every respect but i can think of no other alter â native can you no said slowly not immediately â but but what i see your judgment is not with me think it a little over perhaps you are not so much aware as i am of the mischief map of the that must arise from a young man s being received in this manner â among us â to come at all hours â and placed suddenly on a footing which must do away all to think only of the license which every must tend to create it is au very bad put yourself in miss s place consider what it would be to act with a stranger she has a right to be felt for because she evidently feels for herself i heard enough of what she said to you last night to understand her to be acting with a stranger and as she probably engaged in the part with different expectations â perhaps without considering the subject enough to know what was likely to be â it would be it would be really wrong to expose her to it her feelings ought to be respected does it not strike you so you hesitate i am sorry for miss but i am more sorry to see you drawn in to do what you have resolved against and what you are known to think will be disagreeable to my it will be such a triumph to the park they will not have much cause of when they see how i act but however triumph there certainly will he and i must it but if i can he the means of the of the of the exhibition of our folly i shall be well repaid as i am now i have no influence i can do nothing i have offended them and they will not hear me but when i have put them in good humour by this sion i am not without hopes of persuading them to confine the representation within a much smaller circle than thej are now in the high road for this will be a material gain my object is to confine it to mrs and the will not this be worth gaining yes it will be a great point but still it has not your approbation can you men tion any other measure by which i have a chance of equal good no i think of any thing else give me your approbation then i am not comfortable without it oh cousin if you are against me i ought to distrust and yet but it is absolutely impossible to let tom go on in this way riding about the country in quest of any body who can be persuaded to act â no matter whom the look of a gentleman is to be enough i thought you would have entered more into miss s feelings no doubt she will be very glad it must be a great relief to her said trying for greater warmth of manner she never appeared more amiable than in her behaviour to you last night it gave her a very 
42,strong claim on my good will she kind indeed and i am glad to have her spared â she could not finish the generous her stopped her in the middle but was satisfied i shall walk down immediately after breakfast said he and am sure of giving pleasure there and now dear j will not interrupt you any longer you want to park be reading but i could not be easy till i had to you and come to a decision sleeping or my head has been full of this matter all night it is an evil â but am certainly making it less than it might be if tom is up i shall go to him directly and get it over and when we meet at breakfast we shall be all in high good humour at the prospect of acting the fool together with such you in the mean while will be taking a trip into china suppose how does lord go on â opening a volume on the table and then taking up some and here are s tales and the at hand to relieve you if you tire of your great book i ad mire your little establishment exceedingly and as soon as am gone you will empty your head of au this nonsense of acting and sit comfortably down to your table but do not stay here to be cold he went but there was no reading no china no composure for he had told her the most extraordinary the most inconceivable the most unwelcome news and she could think of nothing else to be acting after all his objections â objections so just and so public after au that she had heard him say and seen him look and known him to be feeling could it be possible so was he not deceiving himself was he not wrong alas it was all miss s doing she had seen her influence in every speech and was miserable the doubts and as to her own conduct which had previously distressed her and which had all while she listened to him were become of little consequence now this deeper anxiety swallowed them up things should take their course she cared not how it ended her cousins might attack but could hardly her she was beyond their reach and if at last obliged to yield â no matter â it

play in point was gained he was to act and he was by the force of selfish inclinations only descended from that moral elevation which he hi before and they were both as much the happier for the

entered with such an of cheerfulness into whole affair as could have at one effect on him he was certainly right in re such feelings he was glad he had determined on l and the morning wore away in very if not very sound one advantage resulted from it o at the earnest request of miss had with her usual good humour agreed to the part for which had been wanted and this vas all that occurred to her heart during the day md even this when imparted by brought a pang â it for it was miss to whom she was obliged t was miss whose kind exertions were to excite gratitude and whose merit in making them

other way her heart and her judgment were equally against â s decision she could not his and his happiness under it made her wretched she was full of jealousy and agitation miss came with looks of gaiety which seemed an insult with friendly ex towards herself which she could hardly answer calmly every body around her was gay and busy and important each had their object of interest their part their dress their favourite scene their friends and â all were finding employment in and or diversion in the playful they suggested she alone was sad and insignificant she had no share in any thing she might go or stay she might be in the midst of their noise or retreat from it to the solitude of the east room without being 
42,seen or missed she could almost think any thing would have been to this mrs grant was of consequence her had honourable mention â her taste and her time were considered â her presence was wanted â she was sought for and attended and praised and was at first in some danger of her the v i i park accepted but reflection brought better feelings and showed her that mrs grant was entitled to respect which could never have belonged to her and that had she received even the greatest she could never have been easy in joining a scheme which considering only her uncle she must con altogether s heart was not absolutely the only one amongst them as she soon began to acknowledge herself was a sufferer too though not quite so henry had with her feelings but she had very long allowed and even sought his attentions with a jealousy of her sister so reasonable as ought to have been their cure and now that the conviction of his preference for maria had been forced on her she submitted to it without any alarm for maria s situation or any at rational tranquillity for herself she either sat in gloomy silence in such gravity as nothing could subdue no curiosity touch no wit amuse or allowing the attentions of mr was talking with forced gaiety tc him alone and the acting of the others for a day or two after the was given henry had endeavoured to do it away by the usual attack of gallantry and compliment but he had not cared enough about it to against a few and becoming soon too busy with his play to have time for more than one he grew indifferent to the quarrel or rather thought it a lucky occurrence as quietly putting an end to what might ere long have raised expectations in more than mrs grant she was not pleased to see excluded from the play and sitting by disregarded but as it was not a matter which really involved her happiness as henry must be the best judge of his own and as he did assure her with a most smile that neither he nor had ever had a serious thought of each other she could only renew her former caution as to the elder sister entreat him not to risk his tranquillity by too much admiration there and then gladly take her share in any thing that brought cheerfulness to the young people in general and that did so particularly promote the pleasure of the two so dear to her park rather wonder is not in love with henry was observation to mary i dare say she is replied mary coldly i imagine x th sisters are both no no that must not he do not give him a hint of it think of mr rush worth you had tell miss to think of mr it may do her some good i often think of mr s property and independence and wish them in other hands hut i never think of him a man might represent the county with such an estate a man might escape a profession and represent the county i dare say he will he in parliament soon when sir thomas comes i dare say he will be in for some but there has been nobody to put him in the way of doing any thing yet sir thomas is to achieve mighty things when he comes home said mary after a pause do you remember s address to tobacco in imitation of pope â leaf whose dispense to modesty to sense i will them knight whose looks dispense to children to sense will not that do mrs grant every thing seems to depend upon sir thomas s return you will find his consequence very just and reasonable when you see him in his family i assure you i do not think we do so well without him he has a fine dignified manner which suits the head of such a house and keeps every body in their place lady seems more of a now than when he is at home and nobody else can keep mrs in order but mary do not fancy that maria cares for henry i am sure does not or she would not have as she did last night with mr and though he and maria are very good friends i think she likes too well to be ix park i would not give much for mr s if henry in before the articles were signed if you have such a suspicion something must be done and as soon as the play is all over we will talk to him seriously and make him know his own mind and if be means we will send him off though he is henry for a time did however though mrs grant discerned it not and though it escaped the notice of many of her j own family likewise she had loved she did love and she had all the suffering which a warm temper and high spirit were likely to endure under the disappointment of a dear though hope with a strong sense of ill usage her heart was sore and angry and she was capable only of angry the sister with whom she was used to be on easy terms was now become her greatest enemy they were from each other and was not superior to the hope of some distressing end to the attentions which were still carrying on there some punishment to maria for conduct so shameful towards herself as well as towards mr with no material fault of temper or difference of opinion to prevent their being very good friends while their interests were the same the sisters under such a trial as this had not affection or principle enough to make them merciful or just to give them honour or compassion maria felt her 
43,triumph and pursued her purpose careless of and could never see maria distinguished by henry without trusting that it would create jealousy and bring a public disturbance at last saw and pitied much of this in but there was no outward fellowship between them made no communication and took no liberties they were two solitary or connected only by s consciousness the of the two brothers and the aunt to s and their blindness to its true cause must be to the fulness of their own minds they were totally pre occupied tom was engrossed by the concerns of his theatre and saw nothing that did immediately park to it between his theatrical and his real part between miss s claims and his own conduct between love and was equally and mrs was too busy in and directing the general little matters of the company their various dresses with economical expedient for which nobody thanked her and saving with delighted integrity half a crown here and there to the absent sir thomas to have leisure for watching the behaviour or guarding the happiness of his daughters chapter xviii every thing was now in a regular train theatre actors and dresses were all getting forward but though do other great arose found before many days were past it was not all enjoyment to the party themselves and that she had not to witness the continuance of such and delight as had been almost too much for her at first every body began to have their vexation had many entirely against his judgment a scene painter arrived from town and was at work much to the increase of the expenses and what was worse of the of their proceedings and his brother instead of being really guided by him as to the privacy of the representation was giving an invitation to every family who came in his way tom himself began to fret over the scene painter s slow progress and to feel the miseries of waiting he had learned his part all his parts â for he took every trifling one that could be united with the butler and began to be impatient to be acting and every day thus was tending to increase his sense of the of all his parts together and make him more ready to regret that some other play had not been chosen being always a very courteous listener and often the only listener at hand came in for the complaints and of most of them she knew that mt a i park in general thou t to that mr disappointed in henry that tom spoke so quick he would he unintelligible that mrs grant spoilt every thing by laughing that â was b nd with his and that it was misery to have any thing to do with mr who was wanting a through every speech she knew also that poor mr could seldom get any body to with him ha complaint came before her as well as the rest and so decided to her eye was her cousin maria s of him and so needles y often the of the first scene between ber and mr that she had soon all the terror of other complaints from mm so far from being all satisfied and all enjoying she found every body requiring something they had not and giving occasion of discontent to the others every body had a part either too long or too short â nobody would attend as they ought â nobody would on which side they were to come in â nobody but the would observe any directions believed herself to derive as much innocent enjoyment from the play as any of them henry acted well and it was a pleasure to her to creep into the theatre and attend

sometimes as sometimes as spectator was often very useful as far as she could judge mr ford was considerably the best actor of all he had more confidence than more judgment than tom more talent and taste than mr she did not like him as a man but she must admit him to be the best actor and on this point there were not many who differed from her mr indeed exclaimed against his and and the day came at last when mr turned to her with a black look and said do you think there is any thing so very fine in all this for the life and sold of me i cannot admire him â and between ourselves to see such an d little mean looking man set up for a fine actor is very i m o vâ park l from this moment was a return of his former jealousy which maria from increasing hopes of was at httle pains to remove and the chances of mr s ever to the knowledge of his two and forty speeches much less as to his ever making any thing tolerable of them had the smallest idea of that except his mother â the indeed regretted that his part was not more considerable and deferred coming over to till they were forward enough in their to comprehend au his scenes but the others at nothing beyond his remembering the and the

lesson would your and your say to see them for such a purpose could sir thomas in up just now he would bless himself fox we are over the house is away in the di room i heard him as i came up stairs and the tl is engaged of course by those and if they are not p i â h surprised by the by i looked in upon them five mi ago and it happened to be exactly at one of the when they were trying not to embrace and mr i worth was with me i thought he be ui to look a queer so i turned it off as well as i could by to him we shall have an excellent the something so maternal in her manner so t in her voice and countenance was not that done of me he brightened up directly now fo she began and joined in with all the m feeling which the idea of representing strongly calculated to inspire but with looks and truly feminine as to be no very good picture of a such an however miss had rage enough and they had got through half the s when a tap at the door brought a pause and the ent of the next moment suspended it all surprise consciousness and pleasure appeared in of the three on this unexpected meeting and as â de was come on the vary same business at had miss consciousness and pleasure were like be more than momentary in them he too had his and was seeking to ask her to with and help him to prepare for the evening without miss to be in the house and great was th of b i together â of park schemes â and in praise of s kind offices she could not equal them in their warmth her spirits bank under the glow of theirs and she felt herself too nearly to to have any comfort in been sought by either they must now together proposed entreated it â till the lady not very unwilling at could refuse no longer â and was wanted only to prompt and observe them she was invested indeed with the office of judge and critic and earnestly desired to exercise it and tell them all their faults but from doing so every feeling within her shrank she could not would not not attempt it had she been otherwise qualified for criticism her conscience must have restrained her from venturing at she believed herself to feel too much of it in ihe for honesty or safety in particulars to prompt them must be enough for her and it was sometimes more than enough for she could not always pay attention to the book in watching them she forgot herself and agitated by the increasing spirit of s manner had once closed the page and turned away exactly as he wanted help it was to very reasonable weariness and she was thanked and pitied but she their pity more than she hoped they would ever at last the scene was over and forced herself to add her praise to the compliments each was giving the other and when again alone and able to recall the whole she was inclined to believe their performance would indeed have such nature and feeling in it as must their credit and make it a very exhibition to herself whatever might be its effect however she must stand the of it again that very day the first regular of the three first acts was certainly to take place in the evening mrs grant and the were engaged to return for that purpose as soon as they could a ter dinner and every one concerned was looking forward with eagerness there seemed a general ion of cheerfulness on the occasion tom was enjoying such an advance towards the end l other day in twenty places i am sure you know the part could not say she did â and as they all â as repeated his wish and with a look of even fond dependence on her good nature â she must yield she would do her every was satisfied and she was left to the of a most hearty while the others prepared to they did and too much engaged in their own noise to he struck hy an usual noise in the other part of the house had proceeded some way when the door of the room was thrown open and appearing at it with a face all aghast exclaimed my father is come i he is in the hall at this moment of thb first park volume the second chapter i how is the con of the party to be described to the greater number it was a moment of absolute horror sir thomas in the house all felt the conviction not a hope of or mistake was any where s looks were an evidence of the fact that made it and after the first starts and exclamations not a word was spoken for half a minute each with an altered countenance was looking at some and almost each was feeling it a stroke the most unwelcome most ill most appalling mr might consider it only as a interruption for the evening and mr might imagine it a blessing but every other heart was sinking under some d of self condemnation or alarm every other heart was suggesting what will become of us what is to be done now it was a terrible pause and terrible to every ear were the of opening doors and passing footsteps was the first to move and speak again jealousy and bitterness had been suspended selfishness waa lost 
43,in the common cause but at the moment of her appearance was listening with looks of devotion to s narrative and pressing her hand to his heart and as soon as she could notice this and see tiiat in spite of the shock of her words he still kept his station and retained her sister s hand her wounded heart swelled again with injury and looking as red as she had been white before she park turned out of the room saying i need not be afraid of appearing before him her going roused the rest and at the same moment the two brothers stepped forward feeling the necessity of doing something a very few words between them were sufficient the case admitted no difference of opinion they must go to the drawing room directly maria joined them with the same intent just then the of the three for the very circumstance which had driven away was to her the sweetest support henry s retaining her hand at such a moment a moment of peculiar proof and importance was worth ages of doubt and anxiety she hailed it as an earnest of the most serious and was equal even to encounter her they walked off utterly heedless c mr s repeated question of shall i go too had not i better go too will not it be right for me to go too but they were no sooner through the door than henry to answer the anxious and encouraging him by all means to pay his respects to sir thomas without delay sent him after the others with delighted haste was left with only the and mr she had been quite overlooked by her cousins and as her own opinion of her claims on sir thomas s affection was much too humble to give her any idea of herself with his children she was glad to remain behind and gain a little breathing time her agitation and alarm exceeded all that was endured by the rest by the right of a disposition which not even innocence could keep from suffering she was nearly fainting all her former habitual dread of her uncle was returning and with it compassion for him and for almost every one of the party on the before him â with solicitude on s account indescribable she had foimd a seat where in excessive trembling she was enduring all these fearful thoughts while the other three no longer under any restraint were giving vent to their of vexation over such an for premature arrival as a most event and without mercy wishing poor sir thomas han field park had been twice as long on his passage or were the more warm on the mr from better understanding the judging more clearly of the mischief that must the ruin of the play was to them a certainty th the total destruction of the scheme to be hand while mr considered it only as a interruption a disaster for the evenings and could suggest the possibility of the being rent after tea when the bustle of receiving sir thomas over and he might be at leisure to be amused by it laughed at the idea and having soon on the propriety of their walking quietly home and the family to themselves proposed mr s ing them and spending the evening at the but mr having never been with those who though much of parental claims or family confidence could not perceive that any thing of the kind was necessary and therefore thanking them said he preferred remaining where he was that he might pay his respects to the old gentleman handsomely since he was come and besides he did not think it would be fair by the others to have every body run away was just beginning to collect herself and to fed that if she staid longer behind it might seem when this point was settled and being with the brother and sister s apology saw them preparing to go as she quitted the room herself to perform the dreadful duty of appearing before her uncle too soon did she find herself at the drawing room door and after pausing a moment for what she knew would not come for a courage which the outside of no door had ever supplied to her she turned the lock in desperation and the lights of the drawing room and all the collected family were before her as she entered her own name caught her ear sir thomas was at that moment looking round him and saying but where is â why do not i see my little â and on perceiving her came forward with a kindness which astonished and penetrated park calling her his dear kissing her affectionately with decided pleasure how much she was town knew not how to feel nor where to look she was quite oppressed he had never been so kind so kind to her in his life his manner seemed changed liis voice was quick from the agitation of joy and all that liad been awful in his dignity seemed lost in tenderness he led her nearer the light and looked at her particularly after her healthy and then observed that he need not for her spoke sufficiently on that point a fine blush succeeded the previous of her face he was justified in his belief of her equal improvement in health and beauty he next after her family especially william and his kindness altogether was such as made her reproach herself for loving him so little and thinking his return a misfortune and when on having courage to lift her eyes to his face she saw that he was grown thinner and had the worn look of fatigue and a hot every tender feeling was increased and she was miserable in considering how much vexation was probably ready to burst on him sir thomas was indeed the life of the party who at 
44,his suggestion now seated themselves round the fire he had the best right to be the and the delight of his sensations in being again in his own house in the centre of his family after such a separation made him and in a very unusual degree and he was ready to give every information as to his voyage and answer every question of his two sons almost before it was put his business in had been rapid and he came directly from liverpool having had an opportunity of making his passage thither in a private vessel instead of waiting for the packet and all e little par of his proceedings and events his and were most promptly delivered as he sat by lady and looked with satisfaction on the faces around him â interrupting himself more than once however to remark on his good fortune in finding them all at i home â coming unexpected as he did â all co field ther exactly as he could have wished but dared not depend on mr was not forgotten a most friendly reception and warmth of hand shaking had already met him and with pointed attention he was now included in the objects most intimately connected with there was nothing disagreeable in mr s appearance and sir thomas was liking him already by not one of the circle was he listened to with unbroken enjoyment as by his wife who really extremely happy to see him and whose were so warmed by his sudden arrival as to place her agitation than she had been for the last twenty years she had been almost fluttered for a few minutes and still so sensibly animated as to put away her work from her side and give all her attention and all the rest of her sofa to her husband she had no anxieties for any body to her pleasure her own time had been spent during his absence she had done a great deal of carpet work and made many yards of fringe and she would have answered as freely for the good conduct and useful pursuits of all the young people as for her own it was so agreeable to her to see him again and hear him talk to have her ear amused and her whole comprehension filled by his that she began particularly to fed how dreadfully she must have missed and how it have been for her to bear a lengthened absence mrs was by no means to be compared in happiness to her sister not that she was hj many fears of sir thomas s when the present state of his house should be known for her judgment had been so blinded that except by the instinctive with which she had away mr s pink satin cloak as her brother in law entered he could be said to show any sign of alarm but she was vexed by the manner of his return it had left her nothing to do instead of being sent for out of the room and seeing him first and having to spread the happy news through the house sir thomas with a very reasonable dependence perhaps on the nerves of his wife and children had sought no but the butler and had been following him park into the mrs felt of an office on which she had always whether his arrival or his were to he the thing unfolded and was now trying to he in a without having any thing to and to he important where nothing was wanted but tranquillity and silence would sir thomas have consented to eat she might have gone to the housekeeper with troublesome du and insulted the with of despatch but sir thomas resolutely declined all dinner he would take nothing nothing till tea came â he would rather wait for tea still mrs was at intervals urging different and in the most interesting moment of his passage to â when the alarm of a french was at the height she burst through his recital with the proposal of soup sure my dear sir thomas a basin of soup would be a much better thing for you than tea do have a basin of soup sir thomas could not be provoked still the same anxiety for every body s comfort my dear mrs was his answer but indeed i would rather ave nothing but tea weu then lady suppose you speak for tea directly suppose you hurry a little he seems behind hand to night she carried this point and sir thomas s narrative proceeded at length there was a pause his immediate were exhausted and it seemed enough to be looking joyfully around him now at one now at another of the beloved circle but the pause was not long in the of her spirits lady became and what were the sensations of her children upon hearing her say how do you think the young people have been themselves lately sir thomas they have been acting we have been all alive with acting indeed and what have you been acting i oh they ll tell you all about it the all will be soon told cried tom hastily and with affected but it is not worth while to ox l park my father with it now you will hear enough of it to row sir we have just heen trying by way of doing something and amusing my mother just within the last week to get up a few scenes a mere trifle we have had such incessant rains almost since october began that we have been nearly confined to the house for days together i have hardly taken out a gun since the d tolerable sport the first three days but there has been no attempting any thing since the first day i went over wood and took the beyond â a ton and we brought home six brace between us and might 
44,each killed six times as many but we respect your sir i assure you as much as you could desire i do not think you will find your woods by any means worse than were never saw wood so full of in my life as this year i hope you will take a day s sport there yourself sir soon for the present the danger was over and s sick feelings subsided but when tea was soon afterwards in and sir thomas getting up said that he found he could not be any longer in the house without just looking into his own dear room every agitation was returning he was gone before any thing had been said to prepare him for the change he must find there and a pause of alarm followed his disappearance was die first to speak â something must be done said he it is time to think of our said maria still feeling her hand pressed to henry s heart and caring little for any thing else where did you leave miss told of their departure and delivered their sage then poor is all alone cried tom i will go and fetch him he will be no bad assistant when it all comes out to the theatre he went and reached it just in time to witness the first meeting of his father and his friend sir thomas had been a good deal surprised to find candles burning in his room and on casting his eye round it to see l l of recent habitation and a general air of ion in the furniture the removal of the the room door struck him especially had scarcely more than time to feel astonished at all th e sounds from the room to li him still further some one was talking there in loud accent â he did not know the voice â more â almost he to the door ng at that moment in having the means of and opening it found himself on the f a theatre and opposed to a young man likely to knock him down backwards at ry moment of perceiving sir thomas and perhaps the very best start he had ever given in the course of his tom entered at the end of the room and never had he found greater ity in keeping his countenance his father s looks and amazement on this his first appearance on age and the gradual of the baron into the well bred and easy mr making his bow and apology to sir thomas ber was an exhibition such a piece of true acting not have lost upon any account it would be it â in all probability the last scene on that stage was sure there not be a finer the house close with the greatest re was little time however for the indulgence of any i of merriment it was necessary for him to step d too and assist the introduction and with many sensations he did his best sir thomas received with all the appearance of cordiality which was his own character but was really as far from pleased he necessity of the acquaintance as with the manner commencement mr s family and sufficiently known to him to render his n as the particular friend another of the hundred liar friends of his son exceedingly unwelcome and it all the felicity of being again at home and all the it could supply to save sir thomas from anger himself thus bewildered in his own j â it l ing pan of a ridiculous exhibition in the midst of nonsense and forced in so a moment to admit the acquaintance of a young man whom he felt sure of and whose easy indifference and in the course of the first five minutes seemed to mark him the most at home of the two tom understood his father s thoughts and heartily wish ing he might be always as well disposed to give them but partial expression began to see more clearly than he had ever done before that there might be some ground of offence â that there might be some reason for the glance his father gave towards the ceiling and of the room and that when he with mild gravity after the fate of the table he was not proceeding beyond a curiosity a few minutes were enough for such unsatisfactory sensations on each side and sir thomas having exerted himself so far as to a few words of calm approbation in reply to an eager appeal of mr as to the happiness of the arrangement the three gentle men returned to the drawing room together sir thomas with an increase of gravity which was not lost on all i come from your theatre said he as he sat down i found myself in it rather unexpectedly its vicinity to my own room â but in every respect indeed it took me by surprise as i had not the smallest suspicion of your acting having assumed so serious a character it appears a neat job however as far as i could judge by candle light and does my friend credit and then he would have changed the subject and his coffee in peace over domestic matters of a calmer hue but mr without to catch sir thomas s meaning or or delicacy or discretion enough to allow him to lead the discourse while he mingled among the others with the least himself would keep him on the topic of the theatre would torment with questions and relative to it and finally would make him hear the whole history of his disappointment at ford sir thomas listened most politely bat found much to his ideas of decorum and confirm his ill of mr s habits of thinking from the to ae end of the story and it was ov r could give him no other assurance of sympathy than what a 
44,slight how â conveyed this was in fact the origin of our acting said tom after a moment s thought my friend brought the from and it spread â as those things always spread you know sir the faster probably from four having so often encouraged the sort of in us for it was like treading old ground again mr took the from his friend as soon as possible and immediately gave sir thomas an account of what they had done and were doing told him of the increase of th views the happy conclusion of first difficulties and present promising state of re every with so blind an interest as made him not only totally unconscious of the uneasy movements of many of his friends as they sat the change of je the the hem of but prevented him even from seeing the expression of the face on which his own eyes were fixed â n seeing thomas s dark brow con tract as he looked with earnestness at his and dwelling particularly on the latter and speaking a language a remonstrance a reproof which felt at his heart not less was it felt by who had edged back her chair behind her aunt s end of the sofa and from notice herself saw all that was passing before her such a look of reproach at from his father e could never haye expected to witness and to feel that it was in any degree deserved was an ag sir thomas s look implied on your judgment i depended what have you been about â she knelt in spirit to her and her bosom to utter oh not to him i look so to all the others but not to him mr was still talking to own the truth sir thomas we were in the middle of a when you arrived this evening we were going through the three first acts and not upon the whole our company is now so dispersed from the being gone home that nothing be done t si â k l i park will na the honour of your company to ing i should not he of the we indulgence you understand as young we be your indulgence my indulgence shall be given sir replied sir gravely hut without any other and with t smile he added i come home to be happy and indulgent then turning away towards any or au of the rest he said mr and miss were mentioned in my last letters from do you find them agreeable acquaintance tom was the only one at all ready with an answer hot he being entirely without particular regard for either with out jealousy either in love or could speak yery handsomely of both mr was a most pleasant gentleman like man his a pretty girl mr could be silent no longer i do not say he is not gentleman like considering but you should tell your father he is not above five feet eighty or he wiu be expecting a well looking man sir thomas did not quite understand this and some surprise at the speaker if x must say what i think continued mr in my opinion it is very disagreeable to be always it is having too much of a good thing i am not so fond of acting as i was at first i think we a great deal better employed sitting comfortably here among ourselves and doing nothing sir thomas looked again and then replied with an smile i am happy to find our sentiments on subject so much the same it gives me sincere satisfaction that i should be cautious and quick sighted and feel many scruples which my children do not is perfectly natural and equally so that my value for domestic tranquillity for a home whidi out noisy pleasures should much exceed theirs but at your time of life to feel all this is a most favourable circumstance for yourself and for every body connected with you and i am sensible of the importance of having an pf such weight ir thomas meant to be giving mr s opinion in better words than he could find himself he was aware he must not expect a genius in mr but as a well judging steady young man with better notions than his would do justice to he intended to value turn very highly it was impossible for many of the others not to smile mr hardly knew what to do vith so much meaning l but by looking as he really felt most exceedingly pleased with sir thomas s good opinion and saying scarcely any thing he did his best towards serving that good opinion a little longer chapter ii s first object die next morning was to see his â id give him a fair statement of the whole acting defending his own share in it as far only as he then in a moment feel his motives to deserve acknowledging with perfect that his â had been attended with such partial good as to make his judgment in it very doubtful he was anxious while himself to say nothing unkind of the but there was only one amongst them whose he could mention without some necessity of defence or we have all been more or less to blame â aid he every one of us excepting is the only one who has judged rightly throughout who has been consistent her feelings have been steadily against it from t to last she never ceased to think of what was due to you will find every thing you could wish sir thomas saw all the of such a scheme among such a party and at such a time as strongly as hia ion had ever supposed he must he felt it too much indeed for many words

45,she loved was at stake her kindness did sometimes her judgment it was a busy morning with him conversation witb any of them occupied but a small of it he had to himself in all the concerns of his field life to see his steward and his â to examine and â and in the intervals of business to wall into his stables and his gardens and nearest but active and he had not only done all this before he resumed his seat as master of the house at ner he had also set the carpenter to work in pulling what had been so lately put up in the room and given the scene painter his dismissal long enough to the pleasing belief of his being then at least as far off as the scene painter was gone having spoiled only the floor of room ruined all the coach man s and made ave of the under servants idle an ed y and sir thomas in hopes that another i park day or two would suffice to wipe away every outward of what had been even to the destruction of every copy of lovers vows in the house for he was burning all that met his mr was b now to understand sir thomas s intentions though as far as ever from understanding their source he and his friend had been out with their guns the chief of the morning and tom had taken the of explaining with proper apologies for his father s what was to be expected mr felt it as as might be supposed to be a time pointed in the same way was an instance of very severe ill lock and his indignation was such that had it not been for towards his friend and his friend s youngest sister he believed he should certainly attack the on the absurdity of his proceedings and argue him into a little more he believed this very stoutly while he was in wood and all the way home but there was a something in sir thomas when they sat round the table which made mr think it wiser to let him pursue his own way and feel the folly of it without opposition he had known many disagreeable fathers fore and often been struck with the they occasioned but never in the whole course of his life had seen one of that class so moral so as sir thomas he was not a man to be endured but for his children s sake and he might be thankful to his fair daughter that mr did yet mean to stay a few days longer under his roof the evening passed with external though every mind was ruffled and the music which sir thomas called for from his to conceal the want of real harmony maria was in a good deal of agitation it was of the utmost consequence to her that should now lose no time in declaring himself and she was disturbed that even a day should be gone by without seeming to advance that point she had been ex to see him the whole morning â and all the even ng too was still expecting him mr had set ff early with the great news for â vi park fondly hoped for such an immediate ai might save him the of ever coming back again but they had seen no one from the â not a creature and had heard no tidings beyond a friendly note of and from mrs grant to lady it was the first day for many many weeks ia which the families had been wholly divided four and twenty hours had never passed before since august began without bringing them together in some way or other it was a sad anxious day and the morrow though in the sort of evil did by no means bring less a few moments of feverish enjoyment were followed by hours of acute henry was again in the house be walked up with dr grant who was anxious to pay his le to sir thomas and at rather an early hour they were ushered into the breakfast room where were most of the family sir thomas soon appeared and maria saw with delight and agitation the introduction of the man she loved to her father her sensations were and so were they a few minutes afterwards upon hearing henry who had a chair between herself and tom ask the latter in an under voice whether there were any plan for the play after the present happy interruption with a courteous glance at sir thomas because in that case he should make a point of returning to at toy time required by the party he was going away being to meet his at bath without delay but if there were any prospect of a renewal of lovers vows he should hold himself positively engaged be should break through every other claim he should absolutely condition with his uncle for attending them whenever he might be wanted the play should not be lost hj hit absence from bath london york â wherever i may be said he â i will attend you firom any place bi england at an hour s notice it was well at that moment that tom had to speak and not his sister he could immediately say with easy i am sorry you are going â but as to our play that is all over â entirely at an end looking park tt his father the painter was sent off yesterday and very little will remain of the theatre to morrow i knew how that would be from the first it is early for bath you will find nobody there it is about my uncle s usual time when do you think of going i may perhaps get as far as to day whose stables do you use at bath was the next question and while 
45,this branch of the subject was under discussion maria who wanted neither pride nor resolution was preparing to encounter her share of it with tolerable calmness to her he soon turned repeating much of what he had already said with only a softened air and stronger of regret but what availed his expressions or his air he was going â and if not going intending to stay away for excepting what might be due to his his engagements were all self imposed he might talk of necessity but she knew his ence the hand which had so pressed hers to his heart the hand and the heart were alike motionless and passive now her spirit supported her but the agony of her â mind was severe she had not long to endure what from listening to language which his actions contradicted or to bury the tumult of her feelings under the restraint of society for general soon called his notice om her and the farewell visit as it then became openly acknowledged was a very i one he was gone â he had touched her hand for the last time he had made hia parting bow and she might seek directly all that solitude could do for her henry was gone â gone â rom the house and within two hours afterwards from the parish â and so ended all the hopes his selfish vanity had raised in maria and could rejoice that he was gone his presence was beginning to be odious to her and if maria gained him not she was now cool enough to dispense any other revenge she did not want exposure to be added to desertion henry gone could even pity her sister park with a purer spirit did rejoice in the be heard it at dinner and felt it a blessing by all the others it was mentioned witli regret and his merits ho with due of feelings from the sincerity of s too partial regard to die of his mother speaking entirely by mrs began to look ut her and wonder that his falling in love with had come to nothing and could almost fear had been herself in it but with so many to care for how was it possible for even her to keep pace with her wishes another day or two and mr was gone likewise in his departure sir thomas felt the chief interest wanting to be alone with his family the presence of a stranger to mr must have been irksome but of him â trifling and confident idle and expensive it was every way in himself he was wearisome but as the friend f tom and the admirer of he became offensive fur thomas had been quite indifferent to mr s going or staying â but his good wishes for mr s having a pleasant journey as he walked with him to the hall door were given with genuine satisfaction mr had staid to see the destruction of every theatrical pre at the removal of every thing ap to the play he left the house in all the of its general character and sir thomas hoped in seeing him out of to be rid of the worst object connected with the scheme and the last that must be inevitably reminding him of its existence mrs contrived to remove one article from his sight that might have distressed the curtain over which she had presided with such talent and such success went off with her to her cottage where she happened to be particularly in want of green â park chapter iii sir thomas s return made a striking change in the ways of the family independent of lovers vows under his government was an altered place some of their society sent away and the spirits of many others it was all and gloom compared with the past â a sombre family party rarely there was little intercourse with tlie sir thomas drawing back from in general was particularly at this time for any engagements bat in one quarter the were the only addition to his own domestic circle which he could did not wonder that such should be his father s feelings nor could he regret any thing but the of the but they he observed to have a they seem to belong to us â they seem to be part of ourselves i could wish my father were more sensible of their very great attention to my mother and sisters while he was away i am afraid they may feel themselves neglected but the truth is that my father hardly knows them they had not been here a when he left england if he knew them better he would value their society as it deserves for they are in fact exactly th sort of people he would like we are sometimes a in want of animation among ourselves my sisters seem out of spirits and tom is certainly not at his ease dr and mrs grant would us and make our evenings pass away with more enjoyment even to my father do you think so said mn my opinion my uncle would not like any addition i think he the very you speak of and that the repose of his own family circle is all he wants and it does not appear to me that we are more serious than we used to be â i mean before my went abroad as well as i can recollect it was always much the same there was never much laughing in his presence or if there is et xi ii not i think than an has a to at first there be a sort of shyness cannot recollect that our were ever ii many except when my was in town no people s are i when

45,thomas not all his good will for mr not all mr s deference for him could prevent him from soon some part of the truth â that mr was an inferior young man as ignorant in ness as in books with opinions in general and without seeming much aware of it himself he had expected very different son in law and be park to feel grave on maria s account tried to understand her feelings little observation there was necessary to tell mm that indifference was the most favourable state they k be in her behaviour to mr was careless r md cold she could not did not like him sir thomas resolved to speak seriously to her advantageous as would â be the alliance and long standing and public as was the en her happiness must not be sacrificed to it mr had perhaps been accepted on too short an acquaintance and on knowing him better she was re with solemn kindness sir thomas addressed her told her his fears into her wishes entreated her to be open and sincere and assured her that every inconvenience should be and the connection entirely given up if she felt herself unhappy in the prospect of it he would act for her and release her maria had a moment s struggle as she listened and only a moment s when her father ceased she was able to give her answer immediately decidedly and with no apparent agitation she thanked him for his great attention his paternal kindness but he was quite mistaken in supposing she had the smallest desire of breaking through her engagement or was sensible of any change of opinion or inclination since her forming it she had the highest esteem for mr s character and disposition and could not have a doubt of her happiness with him sir thomas was satisfied too glad to be satisfied per to urge the matter quite so far as his judgment might dictated to others it was an alliance which he could not have without pain and thus he reasoned mr was young enough to improve mr must and would improve in good society and if maria could now speak so securely of her happiness with him speaking certainly without the prejudice the of love she ought to be believed her feelings probably were not acute he had never supposed them to be so but her comforts might not be less on that account and if she could dispense with seeing her husband a leading shining character there would certainly be every thing else in her favour a well disposed â n park did not marry for love was in general bat die more at l to her own family and the of to must naturally hold out the greatest temptation and would in all probability be a continual supply of die most amiable and innocent such and were the of sir thomas â happy to escape the embarrassing evils of a the wonder the reflections the reproach that must attend it happy to secure a marriage which would bring him such an addition of respectability and influence and very happy to think any thing of his daughter s disposition that was most favourable for the purpose to her the conference closed as satisfactorily as to him she was in a state of mind to be glad that she had secured her fate beyond recall â that she had pledged herself anew to â that she was safe from po of giving the triumph of governing her actions and destroying her prospects and retired in proud resolve de only to behave more cautiously to mr in future that her father might not be again suspecting her had sir thomas applied to his daughter within the first three or four days after henry s leaving before hâ feelings were at before she had given up every hope of him or absolutely resolved on enduring his rival her answer might have been but after another three or four days when there was no return no letter no no symptom of a softened hope of advantage from separation â her mind became cool enough to seek all the comfort that pride and could give henry had destroyed her happiness but he should not know that he had done it he should not destroy her credit her appearance her prosperity too he should not have to think of her as in the retirement of for him and london independence and splendour for his sake independence was more needful than ever the want of it at more sensibly felt she was less and less able to endure the restraint which her father imposed the liberty which his absence had given was now become absolutely park she must escape from him and as soon as possible and find consolation in fortune and consequence bustle and the world for a wounded spirit her mind was quite determined and varied not to such feelings delay even the delay of much would have been an evil and mr could hardly be more impatient for the marriage than herself in all the important preparations of the mind she was complete prepared for matrimony by a hatred of home re and tranquillity by the misery of disappointed affection and contempt of the man she was to marry the rest might wait the preparations of new carriages and might wait for london and spring when her own taste could have fairer play the being all agreed in this respect it soon appeared that a very few weeks would be sufficient for such as must the wedding mrs was quite ready to retire and make way for the fortunate young woman whom her dear son had selected and very early in november removed herself her her footman and her chariot with true propriety to to parade over the wonders of in her evening parties â enjoying them as thoroughly perhaps in the animation of a card 
46,table as she had ever done on the spot â and before the middle of the same month the ceremony had taken place which gave another mistress it was a very proper wedding the bride was dressed â the two were duly inferior â her father gave her away â her mother stood with in her hand expecting to be agitated â her aunt tried to cry â and the was read by dr grant â nothing could be objected to when it came under the discussion of the neighbourhood except that the carriage which conveyed the bride and bridegroom and from the church door to was the same chaise which mr had used for a before in every thing else the of the day might stand the investigation it was done and they were gone sir thomas felt as an anxious father must feel and was indeed ex n of the agitation which his wife had heen of for herself but had fortunately escaped mrs n most happy to assist in the duties of the day by it at the park to support her sister s spirits and the health of mr and mrs in a ass or two was all joyous â for she had match â she had done thing â and no one would supposed from her confident triumph that she had heard of in her life or could ha insight into the of the niece wh been brought

friends to make each of exceedingly glad to be with the other at such a some other companion than mr was of the consequence to his lady and was quite as novelty and pleasure as maria though she might not struggled through so much to obtain them and could i bear a subordinate situation their departure made another material change at li field a chasm which required some time to fill up family circle became greatly contracted and miss had added little to its gaiety could not but be missed even their mother missed â and how much more their tender hearted cousin wandered about the house and thought of them and for them with a degree of affectionate regret which had never done much to deserve chapter iv fairy s consequence increased on the departure of her cousins becoming as she then did the only young woman in the drawing room the only of that in division of a family in which she had hitherto so humble a third it was impossible for her not to be more looked at more thought of and attended to than she had ever been before and where is became no uncommon question even without her being wanted for any one s convenience not only at home did her value increase but at the too in that house which she had hardly entered twice a year since mr s death she became a welcome an invited guest and in the gloom and dirt of a november day most acceptable to mary her visits there beginning by were continued by mrs grant really eager to get any change for her sister could by the easiest self deceit persuade herself that she was doing the kindest thing by and giving her the most important opportunities of improvement in pressing her frequent calls having been sent into the village on some errand by her aunt was overtaken by a heavy shower close to the and being from one of the windows endeavouring to find under the branches and lingering leaves of an oak just beyond their premises was forced though not without some modest reluctance on her part to come in a civil servant she had but when dr grant himself went out with an umbrella there was nothing to be done but to be very much ashamed and to get into the house as fast as possible and to poor miss who had just been contemplating the dismal tain in a very state of mind sighing over the ruin of all her plan of exercise for that morning and of every chance of seeing a single creature beyond themselves for the next twenty four hours the sound of a little bustle at the j door and the sight of miss price n park wet in the was delightful the value of an on a wet day in the country was most forcibly brought before her she was all alive again directly and among the most active in being useful to in her to be than she would at first allow and providing her with dry clothes and after being obliged to submit to all this attention and to being assisted and waited on by and maids being also obliged on down stairs to be fixed in their drawing room for an hour while the rain continued the blessing of something fresh to see and think of was thus extended to miss and might carry on her spirits to the period of dressing and dinner the two sisters were so kind to her and so pleasant that might have enjoyed her visit she have believed herself not in the way and could she have foreseen that the weather would certainly dear at the end of the hour and save her from the shame of having dr grant s carriage and horses out to take her home with which she was threatened as to anxiety for any alarm that her ab in such weather might occasion at home she had nothing to suffer 
46,on th t score for as her being out was known only to her two she was perfectly aware that none would be felt and that in whatever cottage aunt might choose to establish her during the rain her being in such cottage would be to aunt it was beginning to look brighter when ing a harp in the room asked some questions about it which soon led to an acknowledgment of her wishing very much to hear it and a confession which could hardly be of her having never yet heard it since its being in to herself it appeared a very simple and natural circumstance she had scarcely ever been at the since the instrument s arrival there had been no reason that she should but miss calling to mind an early expressed wish on the subject was at her own neglect and shall i play to you now and what will you have were questions immediately following with the good humour she played accordingly happy to have a new park i listener who seemed so much obliged so full of â r at the performance and who showed herself not ig in taste she played till s eyes to on the weather s being evidently fair spoke she felt must be done another quarter of an hour said miss we see how it will be do not run away the of its

besides i want to play something more to you â a pretty piece â your cousin â s prime you must stay and hear your cousin s my felt that she must and though she had not i for that sentence to be thinking of â such made her particularly awake to his idea and him sitting in that room again and again die very spot where she sat now listening with nt delight to the favourite air played as it appeared r with superior tone and expression and though d with it herself and glad to like whatever was liked n she was more sincerely impatient to go away at of it than she had been before and on this evident she was so kindly asked to call again to hem in her walk whenever she could to come and of the harp that she felt it necessary to be done objection arose at home h was the origin of the sort of intimacy which took between them within the first fortnight the going away â an intimacy from miss s desire of something new and had little reality in s feelings went r every two or three days it seemed a kind of n she could not be easy without going and yet it loving her without ever dâ t n without any sense of obligation for being sought after when nobody else was to be had and no pleasure from her conversation than occasional amusement and that often at the expense of her judgment when it was raised by on people or subjects which she wished to be respected she went however and they sauntered about together many a half hour in mrs grant s the weather being unusually mild for the time of year and venturing sometimes even to sit down on one of the benches now comparatively remaining there perhaps till in the midst of some tender of s on the sweets of so protracted an autumn they were forced by the sudden swell of a cold gust shaking down the last few yellow leaves about them to jump up and walk for warmth this is pretty very pretty said looking around her as they were thus sitting together one day every time i come into this i am more struck with its growth and beauty three years ago this was nothing but a rough along the upper side of the field never thought of as any thing or capable of becoming any thing and now it is converted into a walk and it would be difficult to say whether most valuable as a convenience or an ornament and perhaps in another three years we may be forgetting â almost forgetting what it was before how wonderful how very wonderful

rest i do think it is memory there seems something more incomprehensible in the powers the failures the of memory than in any other of our the memory is sometimes so so serviceable so obedient at others so bewildered and so weak and at others again so t so beyond control we are to be sure a miracle every way â but our powers of and of forgetting do seem peculiarly past finding out miss

46,the nights are so mild and i know the end of it will be that we shall have a sudden change of weather a hard frost setting in all at once taking every body at least robert by surprise and i shall lose every one and what is worse cook has just been telling me that the turkey which i particularly wished not to be dressed till sunday because know how much more dr grant would enjoy it on sunday after the of the day will not keep beyond to morrow these are something like and make me think the weather most close the sweets of housekeeping in a country village said miss commend me to tie and the my dear child commend dr grant to the of westminster or st paul s and i should be as glad of your and as you could be but we have no such people in what would you have me do oh you can do nothing but what you do already be very often and never lose your temper thank you â but is no escaping these little mary live where we may and when you are settled in town and i come to see you i dare say i shall find you with yours in spite of the and the or perhaps on their very account their and or their charges and will be drawing forth bitter i mean to be too rich to lament or to feel any thing of the sort a large income is the best for happiness i ever heard of it certainly may secure all the and part of it â par you intend to be very rich said with a look which to s eye had a great deal of serious meaning to be sure do not you do not we all i cannot intend any thing which it must be so completely beyond my power to command miss may choose her degree of wealth she has only to fix on her number of thousands a year and there can be no doubt of their coming my intentions are only not to be poor by moderation and economy and bringing down your wants to your income and all that i understand you â and a very proper plan it is for a person at your time of life with such limited means and indifferent connections â what can you want but a decent maintenance you have not much time before you and your relations are in no situation to do any thing for you or to you by the contrast of their own wealth and consequence be honest and poor by all means â but i not envy you i do not much think i shall even respect you i have a much greater respect for those that are honest and rich your degree of respect for honesty rich or poor is precisely what i have no manner of concern with i do not mean to be poor poverty is exactly what i have determined against honesty in the something between in the middle state of worldly circumstances is all that i am for your not looking down on but i do look down upon it if it might have been i must look down upon any thing contented with when it might rise to distinction but how may it rise how may my honesty at least rise to any distinction this was not so very easy a question to answer and an oh of some length from the fair lady she could add you ought to be in parliament or should have gone into the array ten years ago that is not to the purpose now and as to my in parliament i believe i must wait till there is an â special assembly for the representation of younger sons have little to live on no miss he added n a more serious tone there are â an â d park should be if i thought myself without any â absolutely without chance or possibility of obtaining â but they are of a different character a look of consciousness as he spoke and what seemed a consciousness of manner on miss s side as she made some laughing answer was sorrowful food for s observation and finding herself quite unable to attend as she ought to mrs by whose side she was now the others she had nearly resolved on going home immediately and only waited for courage to say so when the sound of the great dock at park striking three made her feel that she had really been much longer absent than usual and brought the previous self of whether she should take leave or not just then and how to a very speedy issue with decision she directly began her and â began at the same time to recollect that his mother had been for her and that he had walked down to the od purpose to bring her back s hurry increased and without in the least expecting s attendance she would have hastened away alone but the general pace was quickened and they all accompanied her into the house through which it was necessary to pass dr grant was in the and as they to speak to him she from s manner that he did mean to go with her he too was taking leave she could not but be thankful in the moment of was invited by dr grant to eat his mutton with him the next day and had barely time for an unpleasant feeling on the occasion when mrs with sudden recollection turned to her and asked for the pleasure of her company too this was so new an attention so perfectly new a circumstance in the events of s life that she was all surprise and em and while out her great tion and her â but she did not suppose it would be in 
47,her power was looking at for his opinion and help but delighted with her having such a happiness offered and with half a look and half a sentence that she had no objection but on her aunt s park could not imagine that his mother would make any difficulty of her and therefore gave his decided open advice that the invitation should he accepted and though would not venture even on his encouragement to such a flight of audacious independence it was soon settled that if nothing were heard to the contrary mrs grant might expect her and you know what your dinner will he said mrs grant smiling â the turkey â and i assure you a very fine one for my dear turning to her cook upon the turkey s dressed to morrow very well very well cried dr grant all the i am glad to hear you have any thing so good in the house but miss price and mr i dare say would take their ch ce we none of want to hear the bill of fare a friendly meeting and not a fine dinner is all we have in view a turkey or a goose or a leg of mutton or whatever you and your cook choose to give us the two cousins walked home together and except in the immediate discussion of this engagement which ed spoke of with the warmest satisfaction as so par desirable for her in the intimacy which he saw with so much pleasure established it was a silent walk for having finished that subject he grew thoughtful and for any other chapter v but why should mrs grant ask said lady how came she to think of asking â never there you know in this sort of i cannot spare her and i am sure she does not want to go you do not want to go do you if you put such a question to her cried ij n und preventing his cousin s u park say no but i am sure my dear mother she would like to go and i can see no reason why she should not i cannot imagine why mrs grant should think of asking her she never did before she used to ask your sisters now and then but she never asked if you cannot do without me ma am said in a self denying tone but my mother will have my father with her all the evening â to be sure so i shall suppose you take my father s opinion ma am that s well thought of so i will i will ask sir thomas as soon as he comes in whether i can do without her as you please ma am on that head but i meant my father s opinion as to the propriety of the invitation s being accepted or not and i think he will consider it a right thing by mrs grant as well as by that being the first invitation it should be accepted i do not know we will ask him but he will be very f much surprised that mrs grant should ask at all there was nothing more to be said or that could be said to any purpose till sir thomas were present but the subject as it did her own evening s comfort for the morrow was so much uppermost in lady s mind that half an hour afterwards on his looking in for a minute in his way from his plantation to his dressing room she called him back again when he had almost closed the door with sir thomas stop a moment â i have something to say to you her tone of calm languor for she never took the trouble of raising her voice was heard and attended to and sir thomas came back her story began and immediately slipped out of the room for to hear the subject of any discussion with her uncle was more than her nerves could bear she was anxious she knew more anxious perhaps than she ought to be â for what was it after all whether she went or staid â but if her uncle were to be a great while considering and deciding and with very grave looks and those grave looks directed to her i park at last decide against her she might not he to appear properly and indifferent her cause meanwhile went on well it on lady s part with â have something to tell you that will sur you mrs grant has asked to dinner well said sir thomas as if waiting more to accomplish the surprise wants her to go but how can i spare her she will he late said sir taking out his watch hut what is your difficulty â found himself obliged to speak and fill up the in his s story he told the whole and she had only to add so strange for mrs grant never used to ask her but is not it very natural observed that mrs grant should wish to procure so agreeable a for her sister nothing can be more natural said sir thomas after a short deliberation nor were there no sister in the case could any thing in my opinion be more natural mrs grant s showing civility to miss price to lady s niece could never want explanation the only surprise i can feel is that this should be the first time of its being paid was perfectly right in giving only a answer she appears to feel as she ought but as i conclude that she must wish to go since all young people like to be together i can see no reason why she should be denied the indulgence but can i do without her sir thomas indeed i think you may she always makes tea you know when my sister is not here your sister perhaps may be 
47,prevailed on to spend the day with us and i shall certainly be at home very well then may go the good news soon followed her knocked at her door in hia way to his own well it is all happily settled and without the smallest hesitation on your uncle s side he had but one opinion you are to go o park thank you i am â o glad was s instinctive reply though when she had turned from him and shut the door she could not help feeling and yet why ld i be glad for am i not certain of seeing or hearing something there to pain me in spite of this conviction however she was glad sim pie as such an engagement might appear in other eyes it had novelty and importance in hers for excepting the day at she had scarcely ever dined out before and though now going only a mile and only to three people still it was dining out and all the little interests of preparation were in she had net ther sympathy nor assistance from those who ought to have entered into her feelings and directed her taste for lady never thought of being useful to any body and mr when she came on the morrow in consequence of an early call and invitation from sir thomas was in a very ill humour and seemed intent only on her niece i pleasure both present and future as much as possible upon my word you are in high luck to meet with such attention and indulgence you ought to lie very much obliged to mrs grant for thinking of you and to your aunt for letting you go and you ought to look upon it as something extraordinary for i hope you are aware that there is no real occasion for your going into company in this sort of way or ever dining out at all and it is what you must not depend upon ever being repeated nor must you be that the invitation is meant as any particular compliment to the compliment is intended to your uncle and aunt and me mrs grant thinks it a civility due to us to take a little notice of you or else it would never have come into her head and you may be very certain that if your cousin had been at home you would not have been asked at all mrs had now so done away all mrs grant s part of the favour that who found herself expected to speak could only say that she was very much obliged to her aunt for her and that she was endeavouring to put her aunt s evening work in such state as to prevent her being mi d ti b depend upon it your aunt can do very well without you or you would not be allowed to go shall be here so you may be quite easy about your aunt and i hope you will have a very agreeable day and find it all mighty but i must observe that five is the very of all possible numbers to sit down to table and i cannot but be surprised that such an elegant lady as mrs grant should not contrive better and round their great wide table too which fills up the room so dreadfully had the doctor been contented to take my dining table when i came away as any body in their senses would have done instead of having that absurd new one of his own which is wider literally wider than the dinner table here â how infinitely better it would have been and how much more he would have been respected for people are never respected when they step out of their proper sphere remember thai five only five to be sitting round that table however you will have din ner enough on it for ten i dare say mrs fetched breath and went on again the nonsense and folly of people s stepping out of their rank and trying to appear above makes me think it right to give you a hint now that you are going into company without any of us and i do and entreat you not to be putting yourself forward and talking and giving your opinion as if you were one of your cousins â as if you were dear mrs or that will never do believe me remember wherever you are you must be the lowest and last and though miss is in a manner at home at the you are not to be taking place of her and as to coming away at night you are to stay just as long as chooses leave him to settle that yes ma am i should not think of any thing else and if it should rain â which i think exceedingly likely for i never saw it more threatening for a wet evening in my life â you must manage as well as you can and not be expecting the carriage to be sent for you i certainly do not go home to night and therefore the carriage will not be out on my account so you mu t xi o il your mind to what may happen and take your things ae her niece thought it perfectly reasonable she her own claims to as low even as mrs could and when sir thomas soon afterwards just opening the door said at what time you have the carriage come round she felt a degree of astonish ment which made it impossible for her to speak my dear sir thomas cried mrs red with anger can walk walk repeated sir thomas in a tone of most dignity and coming farther into the room my niece walk to a dinner engagement at this time of the year till twenty minutes after four suit you yes sir was s humble answer given with the 
47,feelings almost of a criminal towards mrs and not bearing to remain with her in what might seem a state of triumph she followed her uncle out of the room staid behind him only long enough to hear these words spoken in angry agitation â quite unnecessary â a great deal too kind but goes â it is upon s account i observed he was hoarse on thursday night but this could not impose on she felt that the carriage was for herself and herself alone and her s consideration of her coming immediately after such representations from her aunt her some tears of gratitude when she was alone the coachman drove round to a minute another mi brought down the gentleman and as the lady had with a most scrupulous fear of being late been many minutes seated in ihe drawing room sir thomas saw them off in as good time as his own correctly punctual habits required now i must look at you said with the kind smile of an affectionate brother and tell yon how i like you and as well as i can judge by this light you look very nicely indeed what have you got on the new dress that my uncle was so good as to give me on my cousin marriage v fine park it i thought r ought to wear it as soon as i could and i might not have such another opportunity all the inter i hope you do not think me too fine a woman can never he too fine while she is all in bite no i see no finery you nothing but what j perfectly proper your gown seems very pretty i ke these spots has not miss a gown the same in approaching the they passed dose by the table yard and coach house hey day said here s company here s k carriage who have they got to meet us and letting the side glass to distinguish tis s s i protest there are his own two pushing it bade into its old quarters he is here of this is quite a surprise shall be very glad to see him there was no occasion there was no time for to how very differently she but the idea of having another to observe her was a great increase of the with which she performed the very awful ceremony of walking into the drawing room in the drawing room mr certainly was having been just long enough arrived to be ready for dinner and the smiles and pleased looks of the three others standing round him showed how welcome was his sudden resolution of coming to them for a few days on leaving bath a very cordial meeting passed between him and and with the exception of the pleasure was general and even to er there might be some advantage in his presence since every addition to the party must rather forward her favourite indulgence of being suffered to sit silent and to she was soon aware of this herself for though she must submit as her own propriety of mind directed in spite of her aunt s opinion to the principal lady in company and to all the little distinctions consequent she found while they were at such a happy flow of conversation prevailing in which she was not required to take any part â there was so much to be said f j it brother and sister about bath so much between the young men about hunting so much of politics between and dr grant and of every thing and ah together between mr and mrs grant as to leave her the fairest prospect of having only to listen in quiet and of passing a very agreeable day she could not compliment the newly arrived gentleman however witb any appearance of interest in a scheme for extending his stay at and sending for his hunters from which suggested by dr advised by and warmly urged by the two sisters was soon in possession of his mind and which he seemed to want to be encouraged even by her to resolve on her opinion was sought as to the probable continuance of the open weather but her answers were as short and indifferent as civility allowed she could not wish him to stay and would much rather not have him speak to her her two absent cousins especially maria were much in her thoughts on seeing him but no embarrassing remembrance affected his spirits here he was again on the same ground where all had passed before and apparently as willing to stay and be happy without the miss as if he had never known in any other state she heard them spoken of by him only in a general way till they were au in the room when being engaged apart in some matter of business with dr grant which seemed entirely to and mrs grant occupied at the tea table he began talking of them with more to his other sister with a significant smile which made quite hate him he said so and his fair bride are at i understand â happy man yes they have been there â about a fortnight miss price have they not and is with them and mr i presume is not far off mr oh we hear nothing of mr i do not imagine he figures much in the letters to park do you miss price i think my friend knows better than to entertain her father with mr park poor and his two and forty speeches continued can ever forget them poor fellow i see him now â his toil and his despair well i am much mistaken if his lovely maria will ever want him to make two and forty speeches to her â adding with a momentary seriousness she is too good for him â much too good and then changing his tone again 
47,to one of gentle gallantry and addressing he said you were mr s friend your kindness and patience can never be forgotten your patience in trying to make it possible for him to learn his part â in trying to give him a brain which nature had denied â to mix up an understanding for him out of the of your own t he might not have sense enough himself to estimate your kindness but i may venture to say that it had honour from all the rest of the party coloured and said nothing mt is as a dream a pleasant dream v he exclaimed breaking forth again after a few minutes musing i shall always look hack on our with exquisite pleasure there was such an interest such an animation such a spirit every body felt it we were all alive there was employment hope solicitude for every hour of the day always some httle objection some little doubt some httle anxiety to be got over i never was happier with silent indignation repeated to herself never happier i â never happier than when doing what you must know was not never happier than when so and â oh what a mind â we were unlucky miss price he continued in a lower tone to avoid the possibility of being heard by and not at all aware of her we certainly were very unlucky another week only one other week would have been enough for us i think if we had had the disposal of events â if park had had the government of the winds just for a week or two about the there would have been a difference o i i park not that we would have his safety by any tremendous weather â but only by a steady contrary wind or a calm i think miss price we would have indulged ourselves with a week s calm in the atlantic at at season he seemed determined to be answered and her face said with a firmer tone than usual as far as am concerned sir i would not have delayed his return for a day my uncle it all so entirely when he did arrive that in my opinion every thing had gone quite far enough she had never spoken so much at once to him in her life before and never so angrily to any one and when her speech was over she trembled and blushed at her own daring he was surprised but after a few moments silent consideration of her replied in a calmer graver tone and as if the candid result of conviction i believe you are right it was more pleasant than prudent we were getting too noisy and then turning the conversation he would have engaged her on some other subject but her answers were so shy and reluctant that he could not advance in any miss who had been repeatedly dr grant and now observed those gentlemen must have some very interesting point to discuss the most interesting in the world replied her brother â how to make money â how to turn a good income into a better dr grant is giving instructions about the living he is to step into so soon i find he takes orders in a few weeks they were at it in the dining parlour i am glad to hear will be so well off he will have a very pretty income to make ducks and with and earned without trouble i apprehend he will not have less than seven hundred a year seven hundred a year is a fine thing for a younger and as of course he will still live at home it will be all for his and a sermon at christmas and i suppose will be the sum total of sacrifice his sister tried to laugh off her feelings by sayings nothing me more than the easy manner wi t man park every body settles the abundance of those who have a great deal less than themselves you would look rather henry if your were to be limited to seven hundred a year perhaps i might but all that you know is entirely comparative and habit must settle the business is certainly well off for a of even a s family by the time he is four or five and twenty he wiu have seven hundred a year and nothing to do for it miss could have said that there would be a something to do and to suffer for it which she could not think lightly of but she checked herself and let it pass and tried to look calm and when the two gentlemen shortly afterwards joined them said henry i shall make a point of coming to to hear you preach your first sermon i shall come on purpose to encourage a young when is it to be miss price will not you join me in encouraging your cousin will not you engage to attend with your eyes steadily fixed on him the whole time â as i shall do â not to lose a word or only looking off just to note down any sentence pre eminently beautiful we will provide ourselves with and a pencil when wiu it be you must preach at you know that sir thomas and lady may hear you i shall keep clear of you as long as i can said for you would be more likely to dis concert me and i should be more sorry to see you trying at it than almost any other man will he not feel this thought no he can feel nothing as he ought the party being now all united and the chief each other she remained in tranquillity and as a table was formed after tea â formed really for the amusement of dr grant by his attentive wife it was not to be supposed so â and miss took 
48,her harp â she had nothing to do but to listen and her tranquillity remained undisturbed the rest of the evening ex field park when mr now and then addressed to her t question or which she could not avoid answer t ing miss was too much vexed by what had passed to be in a humour for any thing but music with that she soothed herself and amused her friend the assurance of s being so soon to take orders upon her like a blow that had been suspended and still hoped uncertain and at a distance was felt with re and mortification she was very angry with him she had thought her influence more she had begun to think of him â she felt that she had â with great regard with almost decided intentions but she would dow meet him with his own cool feelings it was that he could have no serious views no true attachment by fixing himself in a situation which he must know she would never stoop to she would learn to match him in his she would admit his attentions without any idea beyond immediate amusement if he could so command his affections j should do her no harm chapter vi had quite made up his mind by the next morning to give another fortnight to and having sent for his hunters and written a few lines of explanation to the admiral he looked round at his sister as he sealed and threw the letter from him and seeing the coast clear of the rest of the family said with a smile and how do you think i mean to amuse myself mary on the days that i do not hunt i am grown too old to go out more than three times a week but i have a plan for the days and what do you think it is to walk and ride with me to be sure not exactly though i shall be happy to do both but that would be exercise only to my body and i must take care of my mind besides that would be all park and indulgence without the wholesome of labour and i do not like to eat the bread of idleness no my plan is to make price in love with me price nonsense no no you ought to be satisfied with her two cousins but i cannot be satisfied without price with out making a small hole in price s heart you do not seem properly aware of her claims to notice when we talked of her last night you none of you seemed sensible of the wonderful improvement that has taken place in her looks within the last six weeks you see her every day and therefore do not notice it but i assure you she is quite a different creature from what she was in the autumn she was then merely a quiet modesty not plain looking girl but she is now absolutely pretty i used to think she had neither complexion nor countenance but in that soft skin of hers so frequently tinged with a blush as it was yesterday there is decided beauty and from what i observed of her eyes and mouth i do not despair of their being capable of expression enough when she has any thing to express and then â her air her manner her is so improved she must be two inches at least since october this is only because there were no tall women to compare her with and because she has got a new gown and you never saw her so well dressed be fore she is just what she was in october believe me the truth is that she was the only girl in company for you to notice and you must have a somebody i have always thought her pretty â not strikingly pretty â but pretty enough as people say a sort of beauty that grows on one her eyes should be darker but she has a sweet smile but as for this wonderful degree of improvement i am sure it may all be resolved into a better style of dress and your having nobody else to look at and therefore if you do do set about a with her you never will persuade me that it is in compliment to beauty or that it proceeds from any thing but your idleness and folly her brother gave only a smile to this accusation an â soon said i do not quite know what to of miss i do not understand her i tell what she would he at yesterday what is her is she solemn is she queer is she pro dish why did she draw hack and look so grave at me i could hardly get her to speak i never was so long in company with a girl in my life â trying to entertain her â and succeed so ill never met with a girl who so grave on me i must try to get the of this her looks say i will not like you i am determined not to like you and i say she shall foolish fellow and so this is her attraction after all this it is â her not caring you â which gives her such a soft skin and makes her so much taller and produces all these charms and graces i do desire that you will not he making her really unhappy a little love perhaps may and do her good hut i will not have yoa plunge her deep for she is as good a little creature as ever and has a great deal of feeling it can be but for a fortnight said henry and if a fortnight can kill her she must have a constitution which nothing could save no i will not do her any harm dear little soul i only want her to 
48,look kindly on me to give me smiles as well as to keep a chair for me by wherever we are and be all animation when i take ii and talk to her to think as i think be interested in all my possessions and pleasures try to keep me longer at and feel when i go away that she shall be never happy again i want nothing more moderation itself said mary i can have no scruples now well you will have opportunities enough of endeavouring to recommend yourself for we are a great deal together and without attempting any further remonstrance she left to her fate â a fate which had not s been guarded in a way by miss have been a little harder than she deserved for there doubtless are such young ladies eighteen or one should not read about them as are to be persuaded into love against their judgment by all thai talent manner attention and flattery can do i have no inclination to believe one of them or to think that with so much tenderness of disposition and so much taste as belonged to her she could have escaped heart whole from the courtship though the courtship only of a fortnight of such a man as in spite of there being some previous ill opinion of him to be overcome had not her on been engaged elsewhere with all the security which love of another and dis esteem of him could give to the peace of mind he was attacking his continued attentions â continued but not and themselves more and more to the gentleness and delicacy of her character â obliged her very soon to dislike him less than formerly she had by no means forgotten the past and she thought as ill of him as ever but she felt his powers be was entertaining and his manners were so improved so polite so seriously and polite that it was impossible not to be civil to him in return a very few days were enough to effect this and at the end of those few days circumstances arose which had a tendency rather to forward his views of pleasing her inasmuch as they gave her a degree of happiness which must dispose her to be pleased with every body william her brother the so long absent and dearly loved brother was in england again she had a letter from him herself a few hurried happy lines written as the ship came up channel and sent into with the first boat that left the at anchor in and when walked up with the newspaper in his hand which he had hoped would bring the first tidings he found her trembling with joy over this letter and listening with a glowing grateful countenance to the kind invitation which her uncle was most in reply it was but the day before that had made himself thoroughly master of the subject or had in fact become at all aware of her having such a brother or his being in such a ship but the interest then excited had been very properly lively him on his return to town to apply for information as to the probable period of the s return from the c au â park luck which his early examination of ship new the next seemed the reward of his ingenuity is ending out such a method of pleasing her as well as of his dutiful attention to the admiral in having for many years taken in the paper esteemed to have the earliest naval intelligence he proved however to he too late all those fine first feelings of which he had hoped to be the were already given but his intention the kindness of his intention was acknowledged â quite and warmly for she was elevated beyond die timidity of her mind by the flow of her love for william this dear william would soon be amongst them there could be no doubt of his obtaining leave of absence immediately for he was still only a and as his parents from on the spot must already have seen him and be seeing him perhaps daily his direct holidays might with justice be instantly given to the sister who had been his best correspondent through a period of seven years and the uncle who had done most for his support and advancement and accordingly the reply to her reply fixing a very early day for his arrival came as soon as possible and scarcely ten days had passed since had been in the agitation of her first dinner visit when she found herself in an agitation of a higher nature â watching in the hall in the on the stairs for the first sound of the carriage which was to bring her a it came happily while she was thus waiting and there being neither ceremony nor to delay the moment of meeting she was with him as he entered the house and the first minutes of exquisite had no interruption nd no witnesses unless the servants chiefly intent upon opening the proper doors could be called such this was exactly what sir thomas and had been separately at as each proved to the other by the sympathetic alacrity with which they both advised mrs s continuing where she was instead of rushing out into the hall as soon as the noises of the arrival reached them william and soon showed themselves and sir thomas had the pleasure of receiving in his certainly a very person from the one he had equipped park â even ago but a young man of an open pleasant countenance and frank but feeling and respectful manners and such as confirmed him his friend tt was long before could recover from the happiness of such an hour as was formed by the last thirty minutes of expectation and the first of it as some time even before her happiness 
48,could be said to make her happy before the disappointment inseparable from the alteration of person had vanished and she could see in him the same william as before and talk to him as her heart had been yearning to do through many a past that time however did gradually come forwarded by an affection on his side as warm as her own and much by refinement or self distrust she was the first object of his love but it was a love which his stronger spirits and bolder temper made it as natural for him to express as to feel on the morrow they were walking about together with true enjoyment and every succeeding morrow renewed a d which sir thomas could not but observe complacency even before â had pointed it out to him excepting the moments of peculiar delight which any marked or for instance of s consideration of her in the last few months had excited had never known so much felicity in her life as in this equal fearless intercourse with the brother and friend who was opening all his heart to her telling her all his hopes and fears plans and respecting that long thought of dearly earned and justly valued blessing of promotion â who could give her direct and minute information of the father and mother brothers and sisters of whom she very seldom heard who was interested in all the comforts and all the hardships of her home at â ready to think of every member of that home as she directed or only by a less scrupulous opinion and more noisy abuse of their aunt â and with whom perhaps the dearest of the whole all the evil and good of their earliest years could be gone over again and every former united pain and pleasure with the recollection an advantage this a â park which even the tie is the cm of the same family the same bloody with the same first associations and habits have some means of enjoyment in their power which no subsequent connections can supply and it must be by a long and unnatural by a divorce which no subsequent connection can justify if such precious remains of the earliest are ever entirely too often alas it is so love sometimes almost every thing is at others worse than nothing but with william and price it was still a sentiment in all its prime and freshness wounded by do opposition of interest cooled by no separate attachment and feeling the influence of time and absence only in iti increase an affection so amiable was advancing each in the opinion of all who had hearts to value any thing good henry was as much struck with it as any he the warm hearted blunt fondness of the young sailor which led him to say with his hand stretched towards s i lead do you know i begin to like that queer fashion already though when i first heard of such things being done in â i could not believe it and when mrs brown and the other women at the s at appeared in the same trim i thought they were mad but can reconcile me to any thing â and saw with lively admiration the glow of s cheek the brightness of her eye the deep interest the absorbed attention while her brother was describing any of the inn or terrific scenes which such a period at sea must supply it was a picture which henry had moral taste enough to s attractions increased â increased â for the sensibility which her com and her countenance was an attraction in itself he was no longer in doubt of the of her heart she had genuine feeling it would be something to be loved by such a girl to excite the first s of her young mind she interested him more than he had foreseen a fortnight was not enough his stay became indefinite park william was often called on by his to be the his were amusing in themselves to sir thomas but the chief object in seeking them was to understand the to know the young man by his histories and he listened to his dear simple spirited details with full satisfaction â seeing in them the proof of good principles professional knowledge energy courage and cheerfulness â every thing that could deserve or promise well young as he was william had already seen a great deal he had been in the â in the west indies â in the again â had been often taken on shore by the favour of his captain and in the course of seven years had known every variety of danger which â ea and war to could offer with such means in his power he had a right to be listened to and though mrs could about the room and disturb every body in quest of two of thread or a second hand shirt button in the midst of her nephew s account of a or an engagement every body else was attentive and even lady could not hear of such horrors unmoved or without sometimes lifting her eyes from her work to say dear me how disagreeable i wonder any body can ever go to sea to henry they gave a different feeling he longed to have been at sea and seen and done and suffered as much his heart was warmed his fancy fired and he felt the highest respect for a lad who before he was twenty had gone through such bodily hardships and given such proofs of mind the glory of heroism of usefulness of exertion of endurance made his own habits of selfish indulgence appear in shameful contrast and he wished he had been a william price himself and working his way to fortune and consequence with so much self respect and happy instead of what he was the wish was rather 
48,eager than lasting he was roused from the reverie of and regret produced by it by some from as to his plans for the next day s hunting and he found it was as well to be a man of fortune at once with horses and at his command in one respect it was better as it gave him th m â xi i p park a kindness where he wished to oblige with spirits courage and curiosity up to any thing william expressed an inclination to hunt and could mount him without the slightest inconvenience to himself and with only some scruples to in sir thomas who knew better than his nephew the value of such a loan and some to reason away in she feared for william by no means convinced by all that he could relate of his own in various of the parties in which he had been engaged the rough horses and he had ridden or his many narrow escapes from dreadful falls that he was at all equal to the management of a high fed hunter in an english fox chase nor till he returned safe and wed without accident or could she be reconciled to the risk or feel any of that obligation to mr for the horse which he had fully intended it should produce when it was proved however to hare done william no harm she could allow it to be a kindness and even reward the owner with a smile when the animal was one minute to his use again and the next with the greatest cordiality and in a manner not to be resisted made over to his use entirely so long as he remained in chapter vii the intercourse of the two families was at this period more nearly restored to what it had been in the autumn than any member of the old intimacy had thought ever likely to be again the return of henry and the arrival of price had much to do with it but much was still owing to sir thomas s more than of the attempts at the his mind now disengaged from the cares which had pressed on him at first was at leisure to find the and their young park really worth visiting and though infinitely above or for any the most advantageous matrimonial establishment that could be among the apparent possibilities of any one most dear to him and dis even as a the being quick sighted on such points he could not avoid in a grand and care less way that mr was somewhat his niece â nor perhaps refrain though unconsciously from giving a more willing assent to invitations on that account his readiness however in agreeing to dine at the when the general invitation was at last after many and many doubts as to whether it were worth while because sir thomas seemed so ill inclined and lady was so indolent â proceeded from good breeding and good will alone and had nothing to do with mr but as being one in an agreeable group for it was in the course of that very that he first began to think any one in the habit of such idle observations would have thought that mr was the admirer of price the meeting was generally felt to be a pleasant one being composed in a good proportion f those who would talk and those who would listen and the dinner itself was elegant and plentiful according to the usual style of the and too much according to the usual habits of all to raise any emotion except in mrs who could never behold either the wide table or the number of dishes on it with patience and who did always contrive to experience some evil from the passing of the servants behind her chair and to bring away some fresh conviction of its being impossible among so many dishes but that some must be cold in the evening it was found according to the of mrs grant and her sister that after making up the table there would remain sufficient for a round game and every body being as perfectly and a choice as on such occasions they always are speculation was decided on almost as soon as and lady soon found herself in the critical situation of being applied to for her own choice between l t p h park and being required either to draw a card for or not she hesitated luckily sir thomas was at hand what shall i do sir thomas and speculation which will amuse me most sir thomas after a moment s thought recommended speculation he was a player himself and perhaps might feel that it would not much amuse him to have her for a partner very well was her s contented then speculation if you please mrs grant i know nothing about it but must teach me here interposed however with anxious of her own equal ignorance she had never played the game nor seen it played in her life and lady ber felt a moment s again â but upon every body s assuring her that nothing could be so easy that it was the easiest game on the cards and henry s stepping forward with a most earnest request to be allowed to sit between her and miss price and teach them both it was so settled and sir thomas mrs and dr and mrs grant being seated at the table of prime intellectual state and dignity the remaining six under miss s direction were arranged round the other it was a fine arrangement for henry who was close to and with his hands full of business having two persons cards to manage as well as his own â for though it was impossible for not to feel herself mistress of the rules of the game in three minutes he had yet to her play her and her 
49,heart which especially in any competition with william was a work of some and as for lady he must continue in charge of all her fame and fortune through the whole evening and if quick enough to keep her from looking at her cards when the deal began must direct her in whatever was to be done with them to the end of it he was in high spirits doing every thing with happy ease and pre eminent in all the lively turns quick resources and playful impudence that could do honour to the game and the round table â er very com park contrast to the steady and orderly silence of ae r twice bad sir into the enjoyment and success of his lady but in vain no pause was long enough for the time his measured manner needed and very little of her state could be known till mrs grant was able at the end of the first rubber to go to her and pay her compliments i hope your is pleased with the game oh dear yes very entertaining indeed a very odd game i do not know what it is all about i am never to see my cards and mr does all the rest said some time afterwards taking the opportunity of a little languor in the game i have never told you what happened to me yesterday in my ride home they had been hunting together and were in the midst of a good run and at some distance from when his horse being found to have flung a shoe henry had been obliged to give up and make the best of his way back i told you i lost my way after passing that old farm house with the trees because i can never bear to ask but i have not told you that with my usual luck â for i never do wrong without gaining by it â i found myself in due time in the very place which i had a curiosity to see i was suddenly upon turning the comer of a field in the midst of a retired village between rising hills a small stream before me to be a church standing on a sort of to my right â which church was strikingly large and handsome for the place and not a gentle man or half a gentleman house to be seen excepting one â to be the â within a stone s throw of the said and church i found myself in short in it sounds like it said but which way did you turn after passing s farm i answer no such and questions though were i to answer all that you could put in the course of an hour you would never be able to prove that it was not â for such it â r p park â â you then no i never but i told a man mending a hedge that it was and he agreed to it you have a good memory i had forgotten having ever told you half so much of the place was the name of his impending living as miss well knew and her interest in a for william price s increased well continued â and how did you like what you saw very much indeed you are a lucky fellow will be work for five at least before the place ii live able no no not so bad as that the farm yard must be moved i grant you but i am not aware of any thing else the house is by no means bad and when uie yard is removed there may be a very tolerable approach to it the farm yard must be cleared away entirely and planted up to shut out the blacksmith s shop the house must be turned to front the east instead of the north the entrance and principal rooms i mean must be on that tide where the view is really very pretty i am sure it may be done and there must be your approach â through what is at present the garden you must make a new garden at what is now the back of the house which will be giving it the best aspect in the world â sloping to the south east the ground seems precisely formed for it i rode fifty yards up the lane between the church and the house in order to look about me and saw how it might all be nothing can be easier the meadows beyond what will be the garden as well as what now is sweeping round from the lane i stood in to the north east that is to the principal road through the village must be all laid together of course very pretty meadows they are finely sprinkled with timber they belong to the j suppose if not you must purchase them then the stream â something must be done with the stream but i could not quite determine what i had two or three ideas and i have two or three ideas also said and one of them ia that very little of your plan for park will ever be put in practice i must be with rather less ornament and beauty i think he house and premises may be made comfortable and g ven the air of a gentleman s residence without any very heavy expense and that must suffice me and i hope may suffice all who care about me miss a little suspicious and of a certain tone of voice and a certain half look attending the last expression of his hope made a hasty finish of her dealings with william price and securing his at an rate exclaimed there i will stake my last like a woman of spirit no cold prudence for me i am not bom to sit still and do nothing if i lose the game it 
49,shall not be from not striving for it the game was hers and only did not pay her for what she had given to secure it another deal proceeded and began again about my plan may not be the best possible i had not many minutes to form it in but you must do a good deal the place deserves it and you will find yourself not with much less than it is capable of excuse me your must not see your cards there let them lie just before you the place deserves it you talk of giving it the air of a gentleman s residence that will be done by the removal of the farm yard for independent of that terrible nuisance i never saw a house of the kind which had in itself so much the air of a gentleman s residence so much the look of a something above a mere house â above the expenditure of a few hundreds a year it is not a collection of low single rooms with as many roofs as windows â it is not cramped into the vulgar of a square â it is a solid mansion like looking house such as one might suppose a respectable old country family had lived in from generation to generation through two centuries at least and were now spending from two to three thousand a year in miss listened and agreed to this the air of a gentleman s residence therefore you cannot but give it if you do any thing but it is capable of much more let me see mai j â p i si bids a dozen for that queen no no a dozen is more than it is worth lady does not bid a dozen she will have nothing to say to it go on go on by some such improvements as i have suggested i do not really require you to upon my plan though by the by i doubt any body s striking out a better â may give it a higher character you may raise it into a place from being the mere gentleman s residence it becomes by judicious improvement the residence of a man of education taste modem manners good connections au this may be stamped on it and that house such an air as to make its owner be set down as the great of the parish by every creature travelling the road especially as there is no real squire s to dispute the point a circumstance between ourselves to the value of such a situation in point of privilege and independence beyond all calculation you think with me i hope â turning with a softened voice to have you ever seen the place gave a quick negative and tried to hide her interest in the subject by an eager attention to her brother who was driving as hard a bargain and imposing on her as much as he could but pursued with no no you must not part with the queen you have bought her too dearly and your brother does not offer half her value no no sir hands off â hands off your sister does not part with the queen she is quite determined the game will be yours turning to her again â it will certainly be yours and had much rather it were william s said smiling at her poor not allowed to cheat herself as she wishes mr said miss a few minutes afterwards you know henry to be such a capital that you cannot possibly engage in any thing of the sort at without accepting his help only think how useful he was at only think what grand things were produced there by our all going with him one hot day in august to drive about the grounds and see his genius take v e and there park si we came home again and what was done there is not to eyes were turned on for a moment with an expression more than grave even but on catching his were instantly withdrawn with something of consciousness he shook his head at his ter and replied i cannot say there was much done at but it was a hot day and we were all walking after each other and bewildered as soon as a general gave him shelter he added in a low voice directed solely at i should be sorry to have my powers of p judged of by the day at i see things very differently now do not think of me as i appeared then was a word to catch mrs and being just then in the happy leisure which followed securing the odd trick by sir thomas s capital play and her own against dr and mrs grant s great hands she called out in high good humour yes that is a place indeed and we had a charming day there william you are quite out of luck but the next time you come i hope dear mr and mrs will be at home and i am sure i can answer for your being kindly received by both your cousins are not of a sort to forget their relations and mr is a most amiable man they are at now you know â in one of the best houses there as mr s fine fortune gives them a right to be i do not exactly know the distance but when you get back to if it is not very far off you ought to go over and pay your respects to them and i could send a little parcel by you that i want to get conveyed to your cousins i should be very happy aunt â but is almost by head and if i could get so far i could not expect to be welcome in such a smart place as that poor as i am mrs was beginning an eager assurance 
49,of the he might depend on when she was stopped by sir thomas s saying with authority i do not advise your going to william as i trust you ma â ik v field park more convenient opportunities of meeting but my would be happy to see their cousins any where and you will find mr most sincerely disposed to regard all the connections of our family as his own i would rather find him private secretary to the first lord than any thing else was william s only answer in an under voice not meant to reach far and the subject dropped as yet sir thomas had seen nothing to remark in mr s behaviour but when the table broke up at the end of the second rubber and leaving dr grant and mrs to dispute over their last play he became a on at the other he found his niece the object of attentions or rather of professions of a somewhat pointed character henry was in the first glow of another scheme about and not being able to catch s ear was it to his fair neighbour with a look of considerable earnestness his scheme was to rent the house himself the following winter that he might have a home of his own in that neighbourhood and it was not merely for the use of it in the season as he was then telling her though consideration had certainly weight feeling as he did that in spite of all dr grant s very great kindness it was impossible for him and his horses to be where they now were without material inconvenience but his attachment to that neighbourhood did not depend upon one amusement or one season of the year he had set his heart upon having a something there that he could come to at any time a little at his command where all the holidays of his year might be spent and he might find himself continuing improving and that friendship and intimacy with the park family which was increasing in value to him every day sir thomas heard and was not offended there was no want of respect in the young man s address and s reception of it was so proper and modest so calm and that he had nothing to censure in her she said little assented only here and there and betrayed no inclination either of any part of the compliment to herself or of his views m park si n of finding by whom he wai henry addressed himself on the same subject to sir thomas in a more every day tone but still feeling i want to be your neighbour sir thomas as you have perhaps heard me telling miss price may i hope for your and for your not your son against such a tenant sir thomas politely bowing replied it is the only way sir in which i could riot wish you established as a neighbour but i hope and believe that will occupy his own house at am i saying too much on this appeal had first to hear what was going on but on understanding the question was at no loss for an answer certainly sir i have no idea but of residence but though i refuse you as a tenant come to me as a friend consider the house as half your own every winter and we will add to the stables on your own improved plan and with all the improvements of your improved plan that may occur to you this spring we shall be the continued sir thomas his going though only eight miles will be an unwelcome of our family circle but i should have been deeply if any son of mine could reconcile himself to doing less it is perfectly natural that you should not have thought much on the subject mr but a parish has wants and claims which can be known only by a constantly resident and which no can be capable of satisfying to the same extent might in the common phrase do the duty of that is he might read prayers and preach without giving up park he might ride over every sunday to a house inhabited and go through divine service he might be the clergyman of every seventh day for three or four hours if that would content him but it wiu not he knows that human nature needs more lessons than a weekly sermon can convey and that if he does not live among and ion s s park constant attention their and friend he does ve little either for their good or his own mr bowed his acquiescence m i repeat again added sir thomas that is the only house in the neighbourhood in which l should not be happy to wait on mr as ij mr bowed his thanks sir thomas said undoubtedly understands the duty of a parish priest we must hope his son may prove that he knows it too whatever effect sir thomas s little might really produce on mr it raised some awkward sensations in two of the others two of his most attentive us miss and one of whom having never before understood that was so soon and so completely to be his home was ing with downcast eyes on what it would be not to see every day and the other startled from the agreeable fancies she had been indulging on the strength of her brother s description no longer able in the picture she had been forming of a future to shut out the church sink the clergyman and see only the respectable elegant and occasional residence of a man of independent fortune â was considering sir thomas with decided as the of all this and suffering the more from that involuntary forbearance which his character and manner commanded and from not daring to relieve herself by a single attempt at throwing ridicule on his 
49,cause all the agreeable of speculation was over for that hour it was time to have done with cards if sermons prevailed and she was glad to find it necessary to come to a conclusion and be able to refresh her spirits by a change of place and neighbour the chief of the party were now collected round the fire and waiting the final break up william and were the most detached they remained together at the otherwise deserted card table talking very comfortably and not thinking of the rest till some of the rest began to think of them henry s chair was the first to be given a them and he sat park observing them for a few minutes himself in the lie observed by sir thomas who was standing in h dr grant is is the assembly night said william if i i should be at it perhaps t you do not wish yourself at william that i do not i shall have enough of â and of dancing too when cannot have you lo not know that there would be any good in going assembly for i might not get a partner the â girls turn up their noses at any body who has one might as well be no ng as a man one is nothing indeed you remember they are grown up amazing fine girls but u hardly speak to me because is by shame shame but never mind it william n cheeks in a glow of indignation as she spoke t worth it is no reflection on you more than what the greatest have all more or less in their time you must think you must try to make up your mind to it as one hardships which fall to every sailor s share â like and hard living â only with this advantage re will be an end to it that there will come a time u will have nothing of that sort to endure when a lieutenant â only think william when you how little vou will care for any nonsense find to think i shall never be a lieutenant k gets made but me my dear william do not talk so do not be so ing my uncle says nothing but i am sure he every thing in his power to get you made he as well as you do of what consequence it is vas checked by the sight of her uncle much nearer than she had any suspicion of and each found it y to talk of something else you fond of dancing â only i am soon tired park i should like to go to a ball with you and see dance have you never any balls at i should like to see you dance and i d dance with y you would for nobody would know who i was here a should like to be your partner once more we jump about together many a time did not we hand organ was in the street i am a pretty good di in my way but i dare say you are a better and i ing to his uncle who was now close to them i a very good sir in dismay at such an did not know which way to look or how to be pre for the answer some very grave reproof or at the expression of indifference must be distress her brother and sink her to the ground bu the contrary it was no worse than i am sorry t that i am unable to answer your question i have seen dance since she was a little girl but i we shall both think she herself like a when we do see her which perhaps we may have an q of doing ere long i have had the pleasure of seeing your sister d mr price said henry leaning forward will engage to answer every which you can on the subject to your entire satisfaction but i b seeing look distressed it must be at some time there is one person in company who does no to have miss price spoken of true enough he had once seen dance a was equally true that he would now have answered fc gliding about with quiet light elegance and in time but in fact he could not for the life of him what her dancing had been and rather took it for gi that she had been present than remembered any about her he passed however for an admirer of her dan and sir thomas by no means displeased conversation on dancing in general and was so well en in describing the balls of and listening to his nephew could relate of the different modes of ds park had fallen his observation that he had not his carriage announced and was first called to the of it by the bustle of mrs come what are you about we are ing do not you see your aunt is going quick i cannot bear to keep good old waiting tou should always remember the coachman and horses my dear sir thomas we have settled it that the carriage should come back for you and and william sir thomas could not as it had been his own arrangement previously communicated to his wife and sister but that seemed forgotten by mrs who must fancy that she settled it all herself s last feeling in the visit was disappointment â for the shawl which was quietly taking from the servant to bring and put round her shoulders was seized by mr s quicker hand and she was obliged to be indebted to his more prominent attention chapter viii william s desire of seeing dance made more than a momentary impression on his uncle the hope of an opportunity which sir thomas had then given was not given to be thought of no more he remained steadily inclined to gratify so 
50,amiable a feeling â to gratify any body else who might wish to see dance and to give pleasure to the young people in general and having thought the matter over and taken his resolution in quiet independence the result of it appeared the next morning at breakfast when after and what his nephew had said he added do not like william that you should leave without this indulgence it would give me pleasure to see you both dance you spoke of the balls at your cousins have occasionally attended them but they would not altogether suit us now the fatigue ci park much for your aunt i believe we must not think of f ball a dance at home would be more eligible and if â ah my dear sir thomas interrupted mrs i knew what was coming i knew what you were going to say if dear were at home or dearest mrs at to afford a reason an occasion for such a thing you would be tempted to give the young people a dance at i know you would if they were at home to grace the ball a ball you would have this very christmas thank your uncle william thank your uncle my daughters replied sir thomas gravely have their pleasures at and i hope are very happy but the dance which i think of giving at will be for their cousins could we be all as our satisfaction would undoubtedly be more complete but the absence of some is not to the others of amusement mrs had not another word to say she saw decision in his looks and her surprise and vexation re some minutes silence to be settled into composure a ball at such a time his daughters absent and herself not consulted there was comfort however soon at hand she must be the of every thing lady ber would of course be spared all thought and exertion and it would all fall upon her she should have to do the honours of the evening and this reflection quickly restored much of her good humour as enabled her to join in with the others before their happiness and thanks were all expressed and did in their different ways look and speak as much grateful pleasure in the pro ball as sir thomas could desire s were for the other two his father had never conferred a favour or shown a kindness more to his satisfaction lady was perfectly and contented and had no objections to make sir thomas engaged for its giving her very little trouble and she assured him that she was not at all afraid of the trouble indeed she could not imagine there would be any park b mrs was ready with her suggestions as to the ms he would think to be used but found it all e arranged and when she would have and about the day it appeared that the day was settled sir thomas had been amusing himself with very complete outline of the business and as soon as e would listen quietly could read his list of the families be invited from whom he calculated with all necessary for the of the notice to collect young enough to form twelve or fourteen couple and old detail the considerations which had induced him to on the d as the most eligible day william was to be at on the th the d â therefore be the last day of his visit but where s days were so few it would be unwise to fix on any mrs was obliged to be satisfied with just the same and with having been on the point proposing the d herself as by far the best day for i purpose the ball was now a settled things and before the evening proclaimed thing to all whom it concerned invitations sent with despatch and many a young lady went to that night wi her head full of happy cares as well to her the cares were sometimes almost fond die happiness for young and inexperienced with all means of choice and no confidence in her own taste the how she should be dressed was a point of pain solicitude and the almost solitary ornament in her a very pretty cross which william had her from was the greatest distress of all she had nothing but a bit of to fasten it to i though she had worn it in that manner once would it at such a time in the midst of au the rich which she supposed all the other young ladies appear in and yet not to wear it william had to buy her a gold chain too but the purchase had in beyond his means and therefore not to wear the might be him these were anxious enough to sober her spirits even under the aspect of a ball given principally for her park the preparations meanwhile went on and lady continued to sit on her sofa without any from them she had some extra from and her maid was rather hurried in p a new dress for her sir thomas gave orders tn f rs ran bnt all this gave her no trouble and as she had foreseen there was in fact no trouble in the was at this time of cares his mind being deeply occupied in the consideration of two important events now at hand which were to his fate in life â and matrimony â events of such a serious character as to make the ball which would be very quickly followed by one of them appear of less moment in his eyes than in those of any other person in the house on the d he was going to a friend near in the same situation as himself and they were to receive in the course of the christmas week half his destiny would then be determined â but the other half might 
50,not be so very smoothly his duties would be established but the wife who was to share and and reward those duties might yet be he knew his own mind but he was not always perfectly assured of knowing miss s there were points on they did not quite agree there were moments in which she did not seem and though trusting altogether to her so far as to be resolved almost resolved on bringing it to a decision within a very r time as soon as the variety of business before him were arranged and he knew what he had to offer her â he bad many anxious feelings many doubting hours as to the result his conviction of her regard for him was sometimes very strong he could look back on a long course of encouragement and she was as perfect in disinterested attachment as in every thing else but at other times doubt and alarm with his hopes and he thought of her acknowledged for privacy and retirement her decided preference of a n â what could he expect but a determined unless it were an acceptance even more to be â â j demanding such sacrifices of situation and employment on side as conscience must forbid the issue of all depended on one question did she love him well enough to forego what had used to be essential points â did she love him well enough to make them no longer essential and this question which he was continually repeating to though answered with a yes had sometimes its no miss was soon to leave and on this circumstance the no and the yes had been very recently in he had seen her eyes sparkle as she spoke of the dear friend s letter which claimed a long visit from her in london and of the kindness of henry in engaging to remain where he was till january that he might convey her thither he had heard her speak of the pleasure of such a journey with an animation which had no in every tone but this had occurred on the first day of its being settled within the first hour of the burst of such enjoyment when nothing but the friends she was to visit was before her he had since heard her express h self differently â with other feelings â more feelings he had heard her tell mrs grant that she should leave her with regret that she began to believe neither the friends nor the pleasures she was going to were worth those she left behind and that though she felt she must go and knew she should enjoy herself when away she was already looking forward to being at again was there not a yes in all this with such matters to over and arrange and could not on his own account very much of the evening which the rest of the family were looking forward to with a more equal degree of strong interest independent of his two cousins enjoyment in it the evening was to him of no higher than any other appointed meeting of the two families might be in every meeting there was a hope of receiving further confirmation of miss s attachment but the whirl of a hall room perhaps was not particularly favourable to the excitement or expression of serious feelings to engage her early for the two first dances was au the com i park of individual happiness which he felt in his power and the only preparation for the ball which he could enter into in spite of all that was passing around him on the subject from morning till night thursday was the day of the ball and on wednesday morning still unable to satisfy herself as to what she ought to wear determined to seek the counsel of the more enlightened and apply to mrs grant and her sister whose acknowledged taste would certainly bear her and as and william were gone to and she had reason to think mr likewise out she walked down to the without much fear of wanting an opportunity for private sion and the privacy of such a discussion was a most important part of it to being more than half ashamed of her own solicitude she met miss within a few yards of the just setting out to call on her and as it seemed to her that her friend though obliged to insist on turning back was unwilling to lose her walk she explained her business at once and observed that if she would be so kind as to give her opinion it might be all talked over as well without doors as within miss appeared gratified by the application and after a moment s thought urged s returning with her in a much more cordial manner than before and proposed their going up into her room where they might have a comfortable without disturbing dr and mrs grant who were together in the drawing room it was just the plan to suit and with a great deal of gratitude on her side for such ready and kind attention they proceeded in doors and upstairs and were soon deep in the interesting subject miss pleased with the appeal gave her all her best judgment and taste made every thing easy by her suggestions and tried to make every thing agreeable by her encouragement the dress being settled in all its parts â but what shall you have by way of said miss shall not you wear your brother s cross and as she spoke she was a small parcel which had observed in her hand when they park met acknowledged her wishes and on this point she did not know how either to wear the cross or to refrain from wearing it she was answered hy having a small placed her and being requested to choose from among several gold chains and such had 
50,been the parcel with which miss was provided and such the object of her intended visit and in the kindest manner she now urged s taking one for the cross and to keep for her sake saying every thing she could think of to the scruples which were making start back at first with a look of horror at the proposal you see what a collection i have said she â more by half than i ever use or think of i do not offer them as new i offer nothing but an old you must the liberty and oblige me still resisted and from her heart the gift was too valuable but miss and argued the case with so much earnestness through all the heads of william and the cross and the ball and herself as to be finally successful found herself obliged to yield that she might not b accused of pride or indifference or some other and having with modest reluctance given her consent proceeded to make the she looked and looked longing to know which might be valuable and was determined in her choice at last by there was one more frequently placed before her eyes than the rest it was of gold prettily worked and though would have preferred a longer and a chain as more adapted for her purpose she hoped in fixing on this to be choosing what miss least wished to keep miss smiled her perfect and hastened to complete the gift by putting the round her and making her see how well it looked had not a word to say against its and excepting what remained of her scruples was exceedingly pleased with an acquisition so very she would rather perhaps have been obliged to some other person but this was an unworthy feeling miss had anticipated her wants with a kindness which proved t i g park friend when i wear this i shall always th of you said she and feel how kind you were you must think of somebody else too when you w that replied miss you must thi of henry for it was his choice in the first place he it to me and with the i make over to you all duty of remembering the original it is to be a the sister is not to be in your mind bringing the brother too in great astonishment and confusion would ha returned the present instantly to take what had been t gift of another person â of a brother too â â it must not be â and with an eagerness and ment quite to her companion she laid down t again on its cotton and seemed resolved either take another or none at all miss thought s had never seen a prettier consciousness my dear said she laughing what are you afraid of do you thi henry will claim the as mine and fancy you d not come honestly by it â or are you imagining he be too much flattered by seeing round your lovely throat ornament which his money purchased three years ago he knew there was such a throat in the world â or â looking â you suspect a between i and that what i am now doing is with his knowledge ai at his desire with the deepest protested against su a thought well then miss more seriously b without at all believing her to convince me that you su no trick and are as of compliment aa have always found you take the and say no mc about it its being a gift of my brother s need not ma the smallest difference in your accepting it as i assure y it makes none in my to part with it he always giving me something or other i have such inn presents from him that it is quite impossible i me to value or for him to remember half and as for tl i do not suppose i have worn it six times it very pretty â but i never think of it and though y park s would be most heartily welcome to any other in my box you have happened to fix on the very one which if i have a choice i would rather part with and see in your possession than any other say no more against it i entreat you such a trifle is not worth half so many words dared not make any further opposition and with renewed but less happy thanks accepted the again for there was an expression in miss s eyes which she could not be satisfied with it was impossible for her to be insensible of mr c s change of manners she had long seen it he evidently tried to please her â he was gallant â he was attentive â he was something like what he had been to her cousins he wanted she supposed to cheat her of her tranquillity as he had cheated them and whether he might not have some concern in this she could not be convinced that he had not for miss as a sister was careless as a woman and a friend reflecting and doubting and feeling that the possession of what she had so much wished for did not bring much satisfaction she now walked home again â with a change rather than a o cares since her treading that path before chapter ix on reaching home went immediately up stairs to deposit this unexpected acquisition this doubtful good of a in some favourite box in the east room which held all her smaller treasures but on opening the door what was her surprise to find her cousin there writing at the table such a sight having never occurred before was almost as wonderful as it was welcome said he directly leaving his seat and his pen and meeting her with something in his hand i beg your pardon 
50,for being here i came to look for you and after waiting a little while in hope of your coming in was q â uie of your to explain my errand you will the beginning of a note to yourself but i can now speak my business which is merely to beg your acceptance of this little trifle â a chain for william s cross you ought to have had it a week ago but there has been a delay from my brother s not being in town by several days so soon as i expected and i have only just now received it at i hope you will like the chain itself i endeavoured to consult the simplicity of your taste bat at any i know you will be kind to my intentions and consider it as it is a token of the love of one of oldest friends and so saying he was hurrying away before overpowered by a thousand feelings of pain and pleasure could attempt to speak but quickened by one sovereign wish she then called out oh cousin stop a moment pray stop he turned back i cannot attempt to thank you she continued in a very agitated manner thanks are out of the question i feel much more than i can possibly express your good ness in thinking of me in such a way is beyond if this is all you have to say smiling and turning away again no no it is not i want to consult you almost unconsciously she had now undone the he had just put into her hand and seeing before her in all the of packing a plain gold chain perfectly simple and neat she could not help bursting forth again â oh this is beautiful indeed this is the very thing pre what i wished for this is the only ornament i ha e ever had a desire to possess it will exactly suit my cross they must and shall be worn together it comes too in such an acceptable moment oh cousin you do not know how acceptable it is my dear you feel these things a great deal too much i am most happy that you like the chain and that it should be here in time for to morrow but your thanks are far beyond the occasion believe me i have no pleasure in the world superior to that of to yours no park s i can safely say i have no pleasure so complete so it is without a upon such expressions of could have lived an hour without saying another word hut after waiting a moment obliged her to bring down her mind from its heavenly flight by sayings but what is it that yon want to consult me about it was about the which she was now most longing to return and hoped to obtain his approbation of her doing she gave the history of her recent â and now her might well be over for was so struck with the circumstance so delighted with what miss had done so gratified by such a coincidence of conduct between them that could not but admit the superior power of one pleasure over his own mind though it might have its it was some time before she could get his attention to her plan or any answer to her demand of his opinion he was in a reverie of fond tion uttering now and then a few half sentences of praise but when he did awake and understand he was very decided in opposing what she wished return the no my dear upon no account it would be her severely there can hardly be a more unpleasant sensation than die having any thing returned on our hands which we have given with a reasonable hope of its to the comfort of a friend why should she lose a pleasure which she has shown so deserving of if it had been given to me in the first instance said i should not have thought of returning it but being her brother s present is not it fair to suppose that she would rather not part it when it is not wanted she must not suppose it not wanted not acceptable at least and its having been originally her brother s gift makes no for as she was not prevented from offering nor you from taking it on that account it ought not to affect your keeping it no doubt it is than mine and for a ball room no it is not not at au in it way and for my purpose not half so t i t agree with william s cross beyond all comparison better than the for one for only one if it a sacrifice â i am sure you will upon consideration make that sacrifice than give pain to one who has been so of your comfort miss s attentions to you have been â not more than you were justly entitled to i am the last person to think that could he â but they have been invariable and to be returning them with what must have something the air of ingratitude though i know it could never have the meaning is not in your nature i am sure wear the as you are engaged to do to row evening and let the chain which was not ordered with any reference to the ball be kept for this is my advice i would not have the shadow of a coolness between the two whose intimacy i have been observing with the greatest pleasure and in whose characters there is so much general resemblance in true generosity and natural delicacy as to make the few slight differences principally from situation no reasonable to a perfect friendship i would not have the shadow of a coolness arise he repeated his voice sinking a little between the two dearest objects have on 
51,earth he was gone as he spoke and remained to herself as she could she was one of his two dearest â that must support her but the other â the first she had never heard him speak so openly before and though it told her no more than what she had long perceived it was a for it told of his own convictions and views they were decided he would marry miss it was a in spite of every long standing expectation and she was obliged to repeat again and again that she was one of his two dearest before the words gave her any sensation could she believe miss to deserve him it would be â oh how different would it how far more tolerable but he was deceived in her he gave her merits which she had not her faults were what they had ever been but he saw them no longer till had ed many tears over this deception could not subdue her agitation and the which followed park only be relieved by the influence of fervent prayers for his happiness it was her intention as she felt it to be her duty to try to overcome all that was excessive all that bordered on selfishness in her affection for to call or to fancy it a loss a disappointment would be a presumption for e had not words strong enough to satisfy her own humility to think of him as miss might hip justified in thinking would in her be insanity to her he could be nothing under any circumstances â nothing dearer than a friend m y did such an idea occur to her even enough to be and forbidden it ought not to have touched on the of her imagination she would endeavour to be rational and to deserve the right of judging of miss s character and the privilege of true solicitude for him by a sound intellect and an honest heart she had all the heroism of principle and was determined to do her duty but having also many of the feelings of youth and nature let her not be much wondered at if after making all these good resolutions on the side of self government she seized the scrap of paper on which had begun writing to her as a treasure beyond all her hopes and reading with the tenderest emotion these words my dear you must do me the favour to accept â locked it up wi the chain as the dearest part of the gift it was the only thing approaching to a letter which she had ever received from him she might never receive another it was impossible that she ever should receive another so perfectly gratifying in the occasion and the style two lines more had never fallen from the pen of the most distinguished author â never more completely blessed the of the the enthusiasm of a woman s love is even beyond the s to her the handwriting itself independent of any thing it may convey is a never were such characters cut by any other human being as s commonest handwriting gave this specimen written in haste as it was had not a fault and there was a felicity in the flow of the first four words in the arrangement of my very dear which she could have looked at s park having regulated her thoughts and comforted her feelings by this happy mixture of reason and weakness was able in due time to go down and resume her usual near her aunt and pay her the usual without any apparent want of spirits thursday to hope and enjoyment came and opened with more kindness to than such days often for soon after breakfast a very friendly note was brought from mr to william stating that as he found himself obliged to go to london on the morrow for a few days he could not help trying to procure a companion and therefore hoped that if william could make up his mind to leave half a day earlier than had been pro posed he would accept a place in his carriage mr meant to be in town by his uncle s late dinner hour and was invited to dine with him at the admiral s the proposal was a very pleasant one to william himself who enjoyed the idea of travelling post with four horses and such a good humoured agreeable friend and in it to going up with was saying at once every thing in favour of its happiness and dignity which his imagination could suggest and from a different motive was exceedingly pleased for the original plan was that william should go up by the mail from the following ni ht which would not have allowed him an hour s rest before he must have got coach and though this of mr s would rob her of many hours of his com she was too happy in having william spared from the fatigue of such a journey to think of any thing else sir thomas approved of it for another reason his ne s introduction to admiral might be of service the admiral he believed had interest upon the whole it was a very joyous note s spirits lived on it half the morning some accession of pleasure from its writer being himself to go away as for the ball so near at hand she had too many and fears to have half the enjoyment in park ss which she ought to have had or have heen supposed to have by the many young ladies looking forward to the tame event in situations more at ease but under circumstances of less novelty less interest less peculiar gratification than would be attributed to her miss price known only by name to half the people invited was now to make her first appearance and must be regarded as the queen of the evening 
51,who could be happier than miss price bat miss price had not been brought up to the trade of out and had she known in what light this ball was in general considered respecting her it would very much have lessened her comfort by increasing the fears she already had of doing wrong and being looked at to dance without much observation or any extraordinary fatigue to have strength and partners for about half the evening to dance a little with and not a great deal with mr to see william enjoy himself and be able to keep away from her aunt was the height of her ambition and seemed to comprehend her greatest possibility of happiness as these were the best of her hopes they could not always prevail and in the course of a long morning spent principally with her two she was often under the influence of much less sanguine views william determined to make this last day a day of thorough enjoyment was out shooting she had too much reason to suppose was at and left alone to bear the worrying of mrs who was cross because the housekeeper would have her own way with the supper and whom she could not avoid though the housekeeper might was worn down at last to think every thing an evil belonging to the ball and when sent ofi with a parting worry to dress moved as languidly towards her own room and felt as incapable of happiness as if she had been allowed no share in it as she walked slowly up stairs she thought of yesterday it had been about the same hour that she had returned from the and found in the east room suppose i were to find him there again to day said she to herself in a fond indulgence of fancy â man park said a voice at that moment near her starting and looking up she saw across the she had just reached himself standing at the head of a different staircase he came towards her you look tired and you have been walking too far no i have not been out at all then you have had within doors which are worse you had better have gone out not liking to complain found it easiest to make no answer and though he looked at her with his usual kindness she believed he had soon ceased to think of her countenance he did not appear in spirits something with her was probably amiss they proceeded up stairs together their rooms being on the same floor above i come from dr grant s said presently you may guess my errand there and he looked so conscious that could think but of one errand which turned her too sick for speech i wished to engage miss for the two first dances the explanation that followed and brought to life again her as she found she was expected to speak to utter something like an as to the result yes he answered she is engaged to me hut with a smile that did not sit easy she says it is to be the last time that she ever will dance with me she is not serious i think i hope i am sure she is not but i would rather not hear it she never has danced with a clergyman she says and she never for my own sake i could wish there had been no ball just mean not this very week this very day â to morrow i leave home struggled for speech and said i am very sorry that any thing has occurred to distress you this ought to be a day of pleasure my meant it so oh yes yes and it will be a day of pleasure it will all end right i am only vexed for a moment in fact it is not that consider the ball as ill timed â what does it signify but stopping her by taking her park hand and low end you know what all this means you see how it is and could tell me perhaps better than i could tell you how and why i am vexed let me talk to you a little you are a kind kind listener i have been by her manner this mornings and cannot get the better of it i know her disposition to be as sweet and as your own but the influence of her former companions makes her seem gives to he conversation to her professed opinions sometimes a tinge of wrong she does not evil but she it â speaks it in â and though i know it to be it me to the soul the effect of education said gently could not but agree to it yes that uncle and aunt they have injured the finest mind for sometimes i own to you it does appear more than manner it appears as if the mind itself was imagined this to be an appeal to her judgment and therefore after a moment s consideration said if you only want me as a listener cousin i will be as useful as i can but i am not qualified for an adviser do not ask advice of me i am not competent you are right to protest against such an office but you need not be afraid it is a subject on which i should never ask advice it is the sort of subject on which it had better never be asked and few i imagine do ask it but when they want to be influenced against their conscience i only want to talk to you one thing more excuse the liberty â but take care how you talk to me do not tell me any thing now which hereafter you may be sorry for the time may the colour rushed into her cheeks as she spoke dearest cried pressing her hand to his lips 
51,with almost as much warmth as if it had been miss s you are all considerate thought but it is unnecessary here the time will never come no such time as you allude to will ever come i begin to think it most improbable the chances grow less and less and even if it should â there will be nothing to be remembered by either you or me that we need be afraid of for i nâ c park be ashamed of my own scruples and if they are removed it must be by changes that will only raise her character the more by the recollection of the she once had you are the only being upon earth to whom i should say what i have said but you have always known my opinion of her you can bear me witness that i have never been blinded how many a time have we talked over her little errors you need not fear me i have given up every serious idea of her but i must be a indeed if whatever me i could think of your kindness and sympathy without the gratitude he had said enough to shake the experience of eighteen he had said enough to give some happier feelings than she had lately known and with a brighter look she answered yes cousin i am convinced that you would be incapable of any thing else though perhaps some might not i cannot be afraid of hearing any thing you wish to say do not check yourself tell me whatever you like they were now on the second floor and the appearance of a prevented any further conversation for s present comfort it was concluded perhaps at the happiest moment had he been able to talk another five minutes there is no saying that he might not have talked away all miss s faults and his own but as it was they parted with looks on his side of grateful affection and with some very precious sensations on hers she had felt nothing like it for hours since the first joy from mr s note to william had worn away she had been in a state absolutely the reverse there had been no comfort around no hope within her every thing was smiling s good fortune returned again upon her mind and seemed of greater value than at first the ball too â such an evening of pleasure before her it was now a real animation and she began to dress for it with much of the happy flutter which belongs to a ball all went well â she did not dislike her own looks and when she came to the again her good fortune seemed complete for upon trial the one given her by miss would by no means go through the ring of the cross she had to oblige resolved to wear it park as too lai for the purpose his therefore must and with delightful feelings joined the id the cross those of the two most he her hearty those dearest tokens so formed for each f every thing real and imaginary â and put them neck and seen and felt how full of william and d they were she was able without an effort to wearing miss s too she it to be right miss had a claim en it was no longer to on to interfere with claims the truer kindness of another she could justice even with pleasure to herself the very well and left her room at last satisfied with herself and all about her aunt had recollected on this occasion i unusual degree of it had really her that preparing for a be glad of better help than the upper when dressed herself she actually sent her own assist her too late of course to be of any use had just reached the floor when miss out of her room completely dressed and only s were necessary but her aunt s dost as much as lady or mrs o themselves chapter x and both her were in the drawing room went down to the former she was an ing object and he saw with pleasure the general her appearance and her being in remarkably good the neatness and propriety of her dress was all that id allow himself to commend in her presence but leaving the room again soon afterwards he spoke with very decided praise park tes â ant looks well i â to hen look well oh yea cried mm she ha good reason to look weu with her np in this family as she has been with all the benefit of her manners before her only my dear sir thomas what yon and i have been the means of giving her the very gown yon bait been ti ng notice â f is your own generous present to her when dear married would â have been if we had not taken her by the hand sir thomas said no more but when they sat down to table the eyes of two young men assured tiie subject might be gently touched again when the ladies drew with more saw die was approved â nd the consciousness of weu made her look still better from a variety of causes she was happy and she was soon made still happier for in following her mt of the room who was holding open the door said as she passed him you must dance with me you must keep two dances for me any two l at you except the first she had nothing more to wish f she had hardly ever been in a state so nearly af high in her life her cousins former on the of a ball was no longer surprising to her she it to he indeed very charming and was actually her steps about the drawing room as long as she could be safe from the notice 
51,of her aunt who was entirely taken up at first in fresh arranging and the noble fire which the butler had prepared half an hour followed that would have been at languid under any other circumstances but s happiness still prevailed it was but to think of her conversation with â and what was the restlessness of mrs what the of lady the gentlemen joined and soon after began die â expectation of a when a general spirit d and enjoyment seemed and they all stood and talked and laughed and every moment had its pleasure and its hope that must be a i s but it to the sort so made when the carriages ye hen the m m to her oi heart was mu the â â â so n en threw her herself and besides the gravity and of the circle of sir thomas lady of a i d tp o away found on something worse she was introduced here and by her uncle and forced o be o en to and to again this was hard duty and die was to it without at as he walked about at ease in the back ground of die scene be with him entrance of the aad was a le epoch the of the meeting soon gave way before their popular manners and â groups were formed and every body grew comfortable the advantage an drawing back from the toils of would have again most happy could die have kept her eyes wandering between and mary she all loveliness â and what might not be of it her own were brought to an end n mr before her and her thoughts were put into another by his engaging her almost instantly for the dances her happiness on this occasion was very d mortal finely to be secure ci a at fir t was a most essential good â for the moment of beginning was now growing seriously near and she so little understood her own claims as to think that if mr had not asked her she must have been the last to be sought after and should have received a only through a series of and bustle and interference which would have been terrible but at the same time there was a in his manner of asking her which she did not like and she saw his eye glancing for a moment at her â with a smile she thought there was a smile â which made her and feel wretched and though there was no second glance to disturb her though his seemed then to be owl c b agreeable she could not get the better of her heightened as it was by the idea of his it and lap had no till he turned away to some one else nor then she could gradually rise up to the genuine of a partner a voluntary partner secured against the dancing b an when the company were moving into the she found for the first time near miss whose eyes and smiles were immediately and more as her brother s had been and who was to speak on the subject when anxious to get the story over hastened to give the explanation of the second â the real chain miss listened and all her intended compliments and to were forgotten she felt only one thing and her eyes bright as they had been before showing they could yet be brighter she exclaimed with eager pleasure did he did that was like himself no other man would have thought of it i honour him beyond expression and she looked around a if longing to tell him so ee was not near he was attending a party of ladies out of the room and mrs grant coming up to the two girls and taking an arm of each they followed with the rest s heart sunk but there was no leisure for thinking long even of miss s feelings they were in the ball room the were playing and her mind was in a flutter that its fixing on any thing serious she must watch the general arrangements and see how thing was done in a few minutes sir thomas came to her and asked if she were engaged and the yes sir to mr was exactly what he had intended to hear mr was not far off sir thomas brought him to her saying something which discovered to that was to lead the way and open the ball an idea that had never occurred to her before whenever she had thought on the of the evening it had been as a matter of course that would begin with miss and the impression was so strong that though her uncle spoke the contrary j she could not help an exclamation of surprise a can field of her an entreaty even to be excused to be urging her opinion against sir thomas s was a proof of the extremity of the case but such was her horror at the first suggestion that she could actually look him in the face and say she hoped it might be settled otherwise in vain however sir thomas smiled tried to encourage her and then looked too serious and said too decidedly â it must be ao my dear for her to hazard another word and she found herself the next moment conducted by mr to the top of the room and standing there to be joined by the rest of the dancers couple after couple as they were formed she hardly believe it to be placed above so many elegant young women the distinction was too great it was treating her like her cousins j and her thoughts flew to those absent cousins with most and truly tender regret that they were not at home to take their own place in the room and have their share of a pleasure which would have been 
52,so very delightful to them so often as she had heard them wish for a ball at home as the greatest of all and to have them away when it was given â and for her to be opening the ball â and with mr too she hoped they would not envy her that distinction now but when she looked back to the state of things in the autumn to what they had all been to each other when once dancing in that house before the present arrangement was almost more than she could understand herself the ball began it was rather honour than happiness to for the first dance at least her partner was in excellent spirits and tried to impart them to her but she was a great deal too much frightened to have any ei till she could suppose herself no longer looked at young pretty and gentle however she had no that were not as good as graces and there were few persons present that were not disposed to praise her she was attractive she was modesty she was sir thomas s niece and she was soon said to be admired by mr it was enough to give her general favour sir thomas himself was watching her progress down the dance with much complacency he was proud of his niece and without â â r i f la her personal as mrs tt do to her to he was pleased for supplied thing else â and i e owed to him miss saw of sir thomas s as he stood and having in i te of i his towards her s general of to him took an of stepping aside to sa f same fa agreeable of her praise was and he it aâ she could wish in it as far as j and and of would allow and certainly appearing to greater advantage on the than his did soon af when mary her on a sofa very near turned round e she b sa to to her on miss price s looks yes she does look very weu was lady placid r y helped her i sent to her not but that at was really pleased to have admired but she was so mu more with her own in sending to her that she not get it out of her head miss knew too to think of gratifying her by of to her it was as the on ah ms am how we want dear mrs and to night and mrs paid her with as many and courteous words as had time for so much occupation as found for herself in making up card tables giving hints to sir thomas and trying to mo e all thâ ho a better part of the room miss most towards in her intentions to please she meant ts bs giving her little heart a happy and her with of delightful s and s at thought she must be doing so â when she went to her after the two and said with a look can tell me my goes to town to morrow he says he has but will not tell me what the first time he ever denied me his confidence but i what we all come ab ate i sooner or later now i to yon for pray what is henry going m ed bear ignorance aa steadily aa bear well replied miss i must suppose it to be purely for the pleasure of roar brother and talking of you by the way was but it was the confusion of ent while miss wondered she did not smile thought her over anxious or thought her odd or bought her any thing rather than insensible of in s attentions had a good deal of enjoyment n tlie course of the evening but henry s attentions had little to do with it she would much rather not have een asked by him again so very soon and she wished she lad not been obliged to suspect that his previous f mrs about the supper hour were all for sake f securing her at that part of the evening but it was not â be avoided he made her feel that she was the object of lu though she could not say that it was lone that there was or in his man and sometimes when he talked of he was really not and showed even a warmth of heart did him credit but still his attentions made no part of her satisfaction she was happy whenever she looked it william and saw how perfectly he was enjoying himself in every five minutes that she could walk about with bim and hear his account of his partners she was happy in knowing herself admired and she was happy in having the two dances with still to look forward to during the greatest part of the evening her hand being so sought after that her indefinite engagement with mm was in continual perspective she was happy even when they did take place but not from any flow of spirits n his side or any such expressions of tender gallantry as blessed the morning his mind was and her sprung from being the friend with whom it could find repose i am worn out with civility said he i have been talking incessantly all night and with nothing say but with you there may be y a park will not want to be talked to let us have the luxury â would hardly even speak her agreement i a weariness arising probably in great measure from tbe same feelings which he had acknowledged in the morning was peculiarly to be respected and they went down their f a two dances together with such sober tranquillity as might satisfy any on that sir thomas had been bringing up no wife for his younger son the evening had afforded little pleasure miss had 
52,been in gay spirits when they first danced together but it was not her gaiety that could do him good it rather sank than raised his comfort and afterwards â for he found himself still impelled to seek her again â she had absolutely pained him by her manner of speaking of the profession to which he was now on the point of be longing they had talked â and they had been he had reasoned â she had â â and they had parted at last with mutual vexation not able to refrain entirely from observing them had seen enough to be tolerably satisfied it was barbarous to be happy when was suffering yet some happiness must and would arise from the very conviction that he did suffer r when her two dances with him were over her tion and strength for more were pretty well at an end and sir thomas having seen her rather walk than dance down the set breathless and with her hand at her side gave his orders for her sitting down entirely from that time mr sat down likewise cried coming for a moment to visit her and working away his partner s fan as if for life â how soon she is knocked up the sport is but just begun i hope we shall keep it up these two hours how can you be tired so soon so soon my good friend said sir thomas producing his watch with all necessary caution â mt is three o clock and your sister is not used to these sort of hours well then you shall not get up to morrow before i go sleep as long as you can and never mind me â oh what did she think of up before you set ff oh yes sir cried rising from her eat to be nearer her uncle i must get up and breakfast him it will be the last time you know the last you had better not he is to have and te gone by half past nine â mr i think you all for him at half past nine was too urgent however and had too many tears n her eyes for denial and it ended in a gracious well which was permission yes half past nine said to william as the latter was leaving them and i shall be punctual for there will be no kind sister to get up for me and in a lower tone to i shall have only a desolate house to hurry from your brother will find my ideas of time md his own very different to morrow after a short consideration sir thomas asked to join the early breakfast party in that house instead of eating alone he should himself be of it and the readiness with which his invitation was accepted convinced him that the suspicions whence he must confess to himself this very m had in great measure sprung were well founded mr was in love with he had a pleasing anticipation of what would be his niece meanwhile did not thank him for what he had just done she had hoped to have william all to herself the last it would have been an unspeakable indulgence but though her wishes were there was no spirit of murmuring within her on the contrary she was so totally unused to have pleasure consulted or jo have any thing take place at all in the way she could that she was more disposed to wonder and rejoice n having carried her point so far than to at the â which followed shortly afterwards sir thomas was interfering a her inclination by her to go to bed advise was his word but it was the park advice of absolute power and she had only to rise with s very pass quietly away stopping at the entrance door like the lady moment and no more to view the happy scene and take a last took at the five or six determined couple w o were still hard at work and then creeping slowly up the principal staircase pursued by tlie ceaseless with hopes and soup and sore footed and fatigued and agitated yet feelings in spite of every things that a indeed delightful in thus sending her away sir perhaps not be thinking merely of her health it might occur to him that mr had been sitting by her long enough or he might mean to recommend her as a wife by showing her p chapter xl the ball was over â and the breakfast was soon over too the last kiss was given and william was gone mi had as he foretold been very punctual an short and pleasant had been the meal after seeing william to the last moment back into the breakfast room with a very to grieve over the melancholy change and there her kindly left her to cry in peace perhaps that th deserted chair of each young man might exercise he tender enthusiasm and that the remaining cold pork bone and in william s plate might but divide her fed the broken e shells in mr s sh sat and cried con as her uncle intended but it wa and no other william was gone an she now felt as if she had wasted half his visit in id cares and selfish with him s disposition was such that she could never think of her aunt in the and park ness of her own small without herself for little want of attention to her when they had heen last er much less could her feelings her of done and said and thought every thing by was due to him for a whole fortnight it was a heavy melancholy day soon after the second breakfast them good by for a week and mounted his horse for and then were gone nothing remained of last night but which she had nobody to 
52,share in she talked to her aunt â she must talk to somebody of the but her aunt had seen so little of what had pa and had so little curiosity that it was heavy work lady was not certain of any body s dress or any body s place at supper but her own she could not what it was that she had heard about one of the miss or what it was that lady had noticed in she was not sore whether colonel had been talking of mr or of william when he said he was the finest young man in the room somebody had whispered thing to her â she had forgot to ask sir thomas it could be and these were her longest speeches and communications the rest was only a languid f yes â yes â very well â did you did he â i did not see that â i not know one from the other this waa very bad it was only better than mrs s sharp answers would have been but she being gone home with all the to nurse a sick maid there was peace and good humour in their little party though it could not boast much beside the evening waa heavy like the day â i cannot think what is the matter with me said lady when the tea things were removed i feel quite stupid it must be sitting up so late last night yon must do something to keep me awake i cannot work fetch the cards â i feel so very stupid the cards were brought and played at with her aunt till and as sir thomas was reading to himself no sounds were heard in the room for the next two hours beyond the of the game u f and that makes thirty one four in hand and eight k you are to deal ma am shall i deal for you thought and thought again of the difference which twenty four hours had made in that room and all that part of the house last night it had been hope and smiles bustle and motion noise and brilliancy in the room and out of the drawing room and every where now it was languor and all but solitude a good night s rest improved her spirits she could of william the next day more cheerfully and as the morning afforded her an opportunity of thursday night with mrs grant and miss in a very handsome style with all the of imagination and all the laughs of which are so essential to the shade of a departed ball she could afterwards bring her mind without much effort into its every day state and easily to the tranquillity of the present quiet they were indeed a smaller party than she had e er known there for a whole day together and he was gone on whom the comfort and cheerfulness of every family meeting and every meal chiefly depended but this must be learned to be endured he would soon be always gone and she was thankful that she could now sit in the same room with her uncle hear his voice receive his questions and even answer them without wretched feelings as she had formerly known we miss our two young men was sir thomas s observation on both the first and second day as they formed their very reduced circle after dinner and in consideration of s swimming eyes nothing more was laid on the first day than to drink their good health but on the second it led to something farther william was kindly commended and his promotion hoped for and there is no reason to suppose added sir thomas but that his visits to us may now be tolerably frequent as to we must learn to do without him this will be the last winter of his belonging to us as he has done yes said lady but i wish he was not going away they are all going away i think i wish they would stay at home s this wish was principally at who had just applied for permission to go to town with maria and as sir thomas thought it for each daughter that the permission should be granted lady though in her own good nature she would not have prevented it as the change it made in the prospect of which would otherwise have taken place about this time a great deal of good sense followed on sir thomas s side tending to reconcile his wife to the arrangement â yery thing that a considerate parent to feel was for her use and every thing that an affectionate mother must feel in her children s enjoyment was attributed to her nature lady agreed to it an with a calm yes â and at the end of a quarter of an s silent consideration observed sir thomas i have been â and i am very glad we took as we did for now the others are away we feel the good of it sir thomas immediately improved this compliment by adding very true we show what a good girl we think her by her to her face â she is now a very valuable companion if we have been kind to her she is now quite as necessary to us yes said lady presently and it is a comfort to think that we shall always have her sir thomas paused half smiled glanced at his niece and then gravely replied she will never leave us i hope till invited to some other home that may reasonably promise her greater happiness than she knows here and that is not very likely to be sir thomas who should invite her maria might be very glad to see her at now and then but she would not think of asking her to live there â and i am sure she is better off 
52,here â and besides i cannot do without her the week passed so quietly and at the house in had a very different character at to the young lady at least in each family it brought very different feelings what was tranquillity and comfort to was and vexation to mary something arose from difference of dis â f habit â ne go satisfied the other so unused to en but still more might be to difference of i in some points of interest they opposed to each other to s s absence was in its and its tendency a to it was every way painful she felt the want of his day almost every hour and was too much in want of it to derive any thing but irritation from tbe for he went he could not have devised thing more likely to his than week s absence as it did at the very time â f her i going away of william price s going too and the sort of general break up of a party which had been w animated she felt it keenly they were now a miserable confined within doors by a series of and ith nothing to do and no variety to hope for angry ti she was with for to his own notions and acting on them in defiance of her and she had been so that they had hardly parted friends at the hall die could not help of him continually when absent on his merit and affection and longing again for the daily meetings they lately had his absence was long he should not have such an â he should not have left home for a week when her own departure from was so near then she began to blame herself she wished she had not so in their last conversation she was afraid she had used some strong some contemptuous expressions in of the clergy and that should not have been it was â it was wrong she wished such words with all her heart her vexation did not end with the week all this was bad but she had still more to feel when friday came round again and brought no â when saturday came and still no â and when through the t communication with the other family which sunday produced she learnt that he had written home to his having promised to remain some days longer with his friend if she had impatience and regret before â if she had been sorry for what she said and feared its too strong effect park b mn â he now felt and feared it all more she to contend with one disagreeable emotion new to her jealousy his friend mr had â he might find them attractive but at any rate staying at a time when according to all preceding she was to remove to london meant something that not bear had henry returned as he talked of at the end of three or four days should now have l een leaving it became absolutely necessary for her to get to and try to learn something more she could not live longer in such solitary wretchedness she made her way to the park through difficulties of walking which she deemed able a week before for the chance of hearing a little in addition for the sake of at least hearing his name the first half hour was lost for and lady were together and unless she had to herself hope for nothing but at last lady left the room â and then almost immediately miss thus began with a voice as well regulated as she could â and how do you like your cousin s staying away so long being the only young person at home i consider as the greatest sufferer you must miss him his staying longer you i do not know said hesitatingly yes â i had not particularly expected it perhaps he will always stay longer than he talks of it is the genial way all young men do he did not the only time he went to see mr before he finds the house more agreeable now he is a very â a very pleasing young man and i cannot help rather concerned at not seeing him again before i go to mi as will now bo the case i am looking for henry every day and as soon as he comes there will be nothing to detain me at i should like to have seen him once more i confess but you must give my to him yes â i think it must be compliments is not there a something wanted miss in our language â a something between compliments â â t park and love â to suit the sort of friendly acquaintance we bull had together so many months acquaintance compliments may be sufficient here was his letter a long one does he give you much account of what he is doing is it christmas that he is staying for i only heard a part of the letter it was to my v â but i believe it was very short indeed i am sure it mi but a few lines all that i heard was that his friend hid pressed him to stay longer and that he had agreed to do so a few days longer or same days longer i am not quite sure which oh if he to his father â but i thought it might have been to lady or you but if he wrote to father no wonder he was who could write l to sir thomas if he had written to you there would have been more particulars you would have heard of balls and parties he would have sent you a description of every ng and every body how many miss are there three grown up are they musical i do not at all know 
53,i never heard that is the first question you know said miss ford trying to appear gay and which woman who plays herself is sure to ask about another but it is very foolish to ask questions about any young about any three sisters just grown up for one knows without being told exactly what they are â all very accomplished and pleasing and me very pretty there is a beauty in every family â it is a regular thing two play on the piano and one on the harp â and all sing â or would sing if they were taught â or sing all the better for not being taught â or something like it i know nothing of the miss said calmly you know nothing and you care less as people say never did tone express indifference indeed how can one care for those one has never seen well when your cousin comes back he will find very quiet â all the noisy ones gone your brother and mine and park i do not like the idea of leading mrs grant now be time draws near she does not like my going felt to speak you cannot your missed hy many said she you will be very much miss turned her eye on her as if wanting to or see more and then said oh yes as every noisy evil is missed when it is taken away is there is a great difference felt but i am not don t compliment me if i am missed it will appear i may be discovered by those who want to see ne i shall not be in any doubtful or distant or region now could not bring herself to speak and miss was disappointed for she had hoped to hear some pleasant assurance of her power from one who she thought must know and her spirits were clouded again the miss â said she soon afterwards â suppose you were to have one of the miss settled at how should you like it stranger things liave happened i dare say they are trying for it and they are quite in the right for it would be a very pretty establishment for i do not at all wonder or blame them it is every body s duty to do as well for themselves ss they can sir thomas s son is somebody and now he is in their own line their father is a clergyman and their brother is a clergyman and they are all together he is their lawful property he fairly belongs to them you don t speak â miss you don t speak but now do not you rather expect it than â otherwise no said stoutly i do not expect it at all not at all cried miss with alacrity i wonder at that but i dare say you know exactly i always imagine you are â perhaps you do not think him likely to marry at au â or not at present no i do not said softly hoping she did not either in the belief or the acknowledgment of it her companion looked at her keenly and gathering greater spirit from the blush soon produced s field look only laid he is best off as he is and till subject chapter xii miss s uneasiness was lightened by this conversation and she walked home again in spirits which might haye defied almost another week of the same small party in the same bad weather had they been put to the proof but as that very evening brought her brother down from london again in quite or more than quite his usual cheerfulness she had nothing further to try her own his still refusing to tell her what he had gone for was but the promotion of gaiety a day before it might have irritated but now it was a pleasant joke â suspected only of concealing something planned as a pleasant surprise to herself and the next day did bring a surprise to her henry had said he should just go and ask the how they did and be back in ten minutes â but he was gone above an hour and when his sister who had been waiting for him to walk with her in the garden met him at last most impatiently in the sweep and cried out mj dear henry where can you possibly have been all this time he had only to say that he had been sitting with lady and sitting with them an hour and exclaimed mary but this was only the beginning of her surprise yes mary said he drawing her arm within his and walking along the sweep as if not knowing where he was â could not get away sooner â looked so lovely i am quite determined mary my mind is entirely made up will it astonish you no you must be aware that i am quite determined to marry price the surprise was now complete for in spite of consciousness might va est a suspicion of his park such views had never entered his sister s imagination she looked so truly the astonishment she felt that he as obliged to repeat what he had said and more fully and solemnly the conviction of his determination once it was not unwelcome there was even pleasure ith the surprise mary was in a state of mind to rejoice in a connection with the family and to be not displeased with her brother s marrying a httle beneath him yes mary was henry s concluding assurance i mm fairly caught you know with what idle designs i li an â but this is the end of them i have i flatter myself made no progress in her affections but my own are entirely fixed lucky lucky girl cried mary as soon as she could speak â what a match for her my dearest henry this must 
53,be mj first feeling but my which you shall have as sincerely is that i a your choice from my soul and foresee your happiness as heartily as i wish and desire it you will have a sweet little wife all and devotion exactly what you deserve what an amazing match for her mrs often talks of her luck what will she say now the delight of all the fa indeed and she has some true friends in it how they will rejoice but tell me all about it talk to me for ever when did you begin to think seriously about her nothing could be more impossible than to answer such a question though nothing be more agreeable than to have it asked how the pleasing plague had stolen on him he could not say and before he had expressed the same sentiment with a little of words three times over his sister interrupted him with ah ray dear henry and this is what took you to london this was your business you chose to consult the admiral before you made up your mind but this he stoutly denied he knew his uncle too well to consult him on any matrimonial scheme the admiral hated marriage and thought it never in a young man of independent fortune when is known to him fix b park he will on her she is exactly the woman to do away every prejudice of such a man as the admiral for she is exactly such a woman as he thinks does not exist in the world she is the very impossibility he would describe â if indeed he has now delicacy of language enough to his own ideas but till it is absolutely settled i settled beyond all interference â he shall know nothing of the matter no mary you are quite mistaken you have not discovered my business yet well well i am satisfied i know now to whom it must relate and am in no hurry for the rest price â wonderful â quite wonderful that should have done so much for â that should have found your fate in but you are quite right you could not have chosen better there is not a better girl in the world and you do not want for fortune and as to her connections they are more than good the are undoubtedly some of the first people in this country she is niece to sir thomas that will be enough for the world but go on go on tell me more wliat are your plans does she know her own happiness no what are you waiting for for â for very little more than opportunity mary she is not like her cousins but i think i shall not ask in vain oh no you cannot were you even less pleasing â supposing her not to love you already of which however i can have little doubt â you would be safe the gentleness and gratitude of her disposition would secure your own immediately from my soul i do not think she would marry you without love that is if there is a girl in the world capable of being by ambition i can suppose it her but ask her to love you and she will never have the heart to refuse as soon as her eagerness could rest in silence he was as happy to tell as she could be to listen and a conversation followed almost as deeply interesting to her as to himself though he had in fact to te but hia own park l nothing to dwell on but s charms j l of face and figure s graces of manner and goodness of hearty were the theme the ness modesty and sweetness of her character were warmly on â that sweetness which makes so essential a part of every woman s worth in the judgment of man that though he sometimes loves where it is not he can never believe it absent her temper he had good reason to depend on and to praise he had often seen it tried was there one of the family excepting who had not in some way or other continually exercised her patience and forbearance her affections were evidently strong to see her with her brother what could more delightfully prove that the warmth of her heart was equal to its gentleness what could be more encouraging to a man ho had her love in view then her understanding was beyond every suspicion quick and clear and her manners were the mirror of her own modest and elegant mind nor wa this all henry had too much sense not to feel the worth of good principles in a wife though he was too little accustomed to serious reflection to know them by their proper name but when he talked of her having such a and regularity of conduct such a high notion of honour and such an of decorum as might warrant any man in the fullest dependence on her faith and integrity he expressed what was inspired by the knowledge of her being well and religious i could so wholly and absolutely confide in her said he and that is what i want well might his sister believing as she really did that his opinion of price was scarcely beyond her merits rejoice in her prospects the more i of it she cried the more am i convinced that you are doing quite right and though i should never have selected price as the girl most likely to attach you i am now persuaded she is the very one to make you happy your wicked project upon her peace turns out a clever thought indeed you will both find your good in it it was bad very bad in me against such a creature b s s but i did not know her then and she hare to lament the hour that

53,and a let sir thomas know to the servant henry to have her go bowed and watched lier and without losing another moment turned instantly to and taking out some letters said with a most animated look i must acknowledge myself infinitely to any creature who gives me such an opportunity of seeing you alone i have been wishing it more than you can have any idea knowing as i do what your feelings as a sister are i could hardly have borne that any one in the house should share with you in the first knowledge of the news i now bring he is made your brother is a lieutenant i have the infinite satisfaction of you on your brother s promotion here are the letters which announce it this moment come to hand you will perhaps like to see them could not speak but he did not want her to speak to see the expression of her eyes the change of her complexion the progress of her feelings their doubt confusion and felicity was enough she took the letters as he gave them the first was from the admiral to inform his nephew in a few words of his having succeeded in the object he had undertaken the promotion of young price and two more one from the secretary of the first lord to a friend whom the admiral had set to work in the business the other from that friend to himself by which it appeared that his had the very great attending to the recommendation of sir charles sir charles was much delighted in having such an opportunity of proving his regard for admiral and that the circumstance of mr william price s as second lieutenant of h m being made out was spreading general joy through a wide circle of great people while her hand was trembling under these letters her eye running from one to the other and her heart swelling with emotion thus continued with eagerness to express his interest in the event â i will not talk of my own happiness said he as it is for i think only of yours compared with who has a right to he happy i have almost my self my own prior knowledge of what you ought to hive known all the world i have not lost a moment however the post was late this mornings but there not been since a moment s delay how impatient how anxious how wild i have been on the i will not attempt to describe how severely how disappointed in not having it finished while i was in don i was kept there from day to day in the hope of it for nothing less dear to me than such an object would have detained me half the time from but though my uncle entered into my wishes with all the warmth i could desire and exerted himself immediately there were difficulties from the absence of one friend and the engagements of another which at last i could no longer bear to stay the end of and knowing in what good hands the cause i came away on monday trusting that many posts would not pa before i should be followed by such very letters as these my uncle who is the very best man in the world has exerted himself as i knew he would after seeing your brother he was delighted with him would not allow myself yesterday to say how delighted or to repeat half that the admiral said in his praise i deferred it all till his praise should be proved the praise of as this day does prove it now i may say that could not require william price to excite a greater interest or be followed by warmer wishes and higher than were most voluntarily bestowed by my after the evening they passed together has this been all doing then cried good heaven how very very kind j have you really â was it by your desire â i b your pardon but i am bewildered did admiral apply â how was it â i am henry was most happy to make it more intelligible by beginning at an earlier stage and explaining very particularly what he had done his last journey to london had been undertaken with no other view than that of park her brother in hill street and prevailing the to exert whatever interest he might have for getting hi this had been his business he had it to no creature he had not breathed a syllable of it even to mary while of the issue he could not have borne any m of his feelings but this bad been his and he spoke with such a glow of what his solicitude had been and used such strong expressions was so in the deepest interest in motives in views and wishes more than could be told that could not have remained insensible of his drift had she been able to attend but her heart was so full and her still so that she could listen but imperfectly i to what he told her of william and saying only when he paused how kind how very kind oh mr we are infinitely obliged to you dearest dearest she jumped up and moved in haste towards the door crying out i will go to my my ought to know it as soon as possible but this could not be suffered the opportunity was too fair and his feelings too impatient he was after her immediately she must not go she must allow him five minutes longer and he took her hand and led her back to her seat and was in the middle of his further explanation before he had suspected for what she was detained when she did understand it however and found herself expected to believe that she had created sensations which his heart had never known before and 
54,that every thing he had done for william was to be placed to the account of his excessive and to her she was exceedingly distressed and for some moments unable to speak she considered it all as nonsense as mere trifling and gallantry which meant only to deceive for the hour she could not but fed that it was treating her and and in a way as she had not deserved but it was like himself and entirely of a piece with what she had seen before and she would not allow herself to show half the displeasure she because he had been an obligation which no want of on his part could make a trifle to her while her heart was still bounding s park with joy and gratitude on william s behalf she could not be severely of any thing that injured only herself and after having twice drawn back her hand and twice at tempted in vain to turn away from him she got up and said only with much agitation don t mr pray don t i beg you would not this is a sort of talking which is very unpleasant to me i must go away i cannot bear it but he was still talking on describing his affection a return and in words so plain as to bear but one meaning even to her offering himself hand fortune every thing to her acceptance it was so he had said it her astonishment and confusion and though still not knowing how to suppose him serious she could hardly stand he pressed for an answer no no no she cried hiding her face this is all nonsense do not distress me i can hear no more of this your kindness to william makes me more obliged to you than words can express but i do not want i cannot bear i must not listen to such â no no don t think of me but you are not thinking of me i know it is all nothing she had burst away from him and at that moment sir thomas was heard speaking to a servant in his way to wards the room they were in it was no time for assurances or entreaty though to part with her at a moment when her modesty alone seemed to his sanguine and mind to stand in the way of the happiness he sought was a cruel necessity she rushed out at an â ite door from the one her uncle was approaching and was walking up and down the east in the utmost confusion of contrary feeling before sir thomas s polite ness or apologies were over or he had reached the b n of the joyful intelligence which his came to communicate she was feeling thinking trembling about every thing agitated happy miserable infinitely obliged absolutely angry it was all beyond belief he was incomprehensible but such were his habits that he could do without a mixture of evil he had previously made her the happiest of human beings and now he had park insulted â she knew not what to say â how to or how to regard it she would not have him he serious and yet what could excuse the use of such words and offers if they meant hut to trifle but william was a lieutenant that was a fact a doubt and without an she would think of it for ever and forget all the rest mr would certainly never address her so again he must have seen how unwelcome it was to her and in that case how gratefully she could esteem him for his friendship to william she would not stir farther from the east room than the head of the great staircase till she had satisfied herself of mr s having left the house but when convinced of his being gone she was eager to go down and be with her and have all the happiness of his joy as well as her own and all the benefit of his information or his con as to what would now be william s destination sir thomas was as as she could desire and very kind and and she had so comfortable a talk with him about william as to make her feel as if nothing had occurred to vex her till she found towards the close that mr was engaged to return and dine there that very day this was a most unwelcome hearing for though he might think nothing of what had passed it would be quite distressing to her to see him again so soon she tried to get the better of it tried very hard as the dinner hour approached to feel and appear as usual but it was quite impossible for her not to look most shy and uncomfortable when their entered the room she could not have supposed it in the power of any of circumstances to give her so many painful sensations on the first day of hearing of william s promotion mr was not only in the room â he was soon dose to her he had a note to deliver from his sister f could not look at him but there was no conscious less of past folly in his voice she opened her note glad to have any thing to do and happy as she â it to feel that the of her aunt who also to there her a little from view t my â for so i may now always call yon to the infinite relief of a tongue that has heen stumbling at miss price for at least the last six weeks â i cannot let my brother go without sending you a few lines of general and giving my most joyful consent and approval go on my dear and without fear there can be no difficulties worth i choose to suppose that the assurance of my consent 
54,will be something so you may smile upon him with your sweetest this afternoon and send him back to me happier than he goes yours affectionately m c these were not expressions to do any good for though she read in too much haste and confusion to the judgment of miss s meaning it was evident that she meant to compliment her on her brother s attachment and even to appear to believe it serious she did not know what to do or what to think there was wretchedness in the idea of its being serious there was perplexity and agitation every way she was distressed whenever mr spoke to her and he spoke to her much too often and she was afraid there was something ill his voice and manner in addressing her very different from what they were when he talked to the others her comfort in that day s dinner was quite destroyed she could hardly eat any thing and when sir thomas good observed that joy had taken away her appetite she was ready to sink with shame from the dread of mr s interpretation for though nothing could have tempted her to turn her eyes to the right hand where he sat she felt that his were immediately directed towards her she was more silent than ever she would hardly join even when william was the subject for his commission came all from the right hand too and there was pain in the connection she thought lady sat longer than ever and began to be in despair of ever getting away but at last they were in the drawing room and she was able to think park t she would while her finished the of s appointment in their own style mrs seemed as much delighted with the saving it would he to sir thomas as with any part of it now william would be able to keep himself which would make a vast difference to his for it was unknown how much he had cost his uncle and indeed it would make some difference in her presents too she was very glad that she had given william what she did at very glad indeed that it had been in her power without material inconvenience just at that time to give him something rather considerable that is for her with her means for now it would all be useful in helping to fit up his cabin she knew he must be at some expense that he would have many things to buy though to be sure his father and mother would be able to put him in the way of getting every thing very cheap â but she was very glad that she had con her towards it i am glad you gave him something considerable said lady with most calmness for i gave him only indeed cried mrs upon my word he must have gone off with his pockets well lined and at no expense for his journey to london either sir thomas told me would be enough mrs being not at all inclined to question its began to take the matter in another point it is amazing said she how much young people cost their friends what with bringing them up and putting them out in the world they uttle think how much it to or what their parents or their and pay for them in the course of the year now here are my sister price s children take them i dare say nobody would believe what a sum they cost sir thomas every year to say nothing of what do for them very true sister as you say but poor things they cannot help it and you know it makes very little differ ence to sir thomas must not forget my shawl if he goes to the east indies and i shall give him a commission for any thing else that is worth having i park wish he may go to the east indies that i may have my shawl i think i will have two meanwhile speaking only when she could not help it was very earnestly trying to understand what mr and miss were at there was every thing in the world against their serious hut his words and manner every thing natural reasonable was against it all their habits and ways of thinking and all her own how could she have excited serious attachment in a man who had seen so many and been admired hy so many and with so many infinitely her who seemed so little open to serious impressions even where pains had been taken to please him â who thought so slightly so carelessly so on all such points t â who was every thing to every body and seemed to find no one essential to him and further how could it be supposed that his sister with all her high and worldly notions of matrimony would be any thing of a serious nature in such a quarter nothing could be more unnatural in either was ashamed of her own doubts every thing might be possible rather than serious attachment or serious approbation of it toward her she had quite convinced of this before sir thomas and mr joined them the difficulty was in main the conviction quite so absolutely after mr ford was in the room for once or twice a look seemed forced on her which she did not know how to class among the common meaning in any other man at least she would have said that it meant something very earnest very pointed but she still tried to believe it no more than what he might often have expressed towards her cousins and fifty other women she thought he was wishing to speak to her unheard by the rest she fancied he was trying for it the whole ing at intervals whenever sir thomas was out of the room or 
54,at all engaged with mrs and she carefully refused him every opportunity at last â it seemed an at last to s though not remarkably late â he began to talk of going away but the comfort of the sound was by his turning to park her the next moment and sayings have you nothing to send to mary no answer to her note she will be disappointed if she receives nothing from you pray write to her if it be only a line oh yes certainly cried rising in haste the haste of embarrassment and of wanting to get away â i will write directly she went accordingly to the table where she was in the habit of writing for her aunt and prepared her materials without knowing what in the world to say she had read miss s note only once and how to reply to any thing so imperfectly understood was most distressing quite in such sort of note writing had there been time for scruples and fears as to style she would have felt them in abundance but something must be instantly written and with only one decided feeling that of wishing not to appear to think any thing really intended she wrote thus in great trembling both of spirits and hand â i am very much obliged to you my dear miss for your kind congratulations as far as they relate to my dearest william the rest of your note i know means nothing but i am so unequal to any thing of the sort that i hope you will excuse my begging you to take no further notice i have seen too much of mr not to understand his manners if he understood me as well he would i dare say behave differently i do not know what i write but it would be a great favour of you never to mention the subject again with thanks for the honour of your note i remain dear miss c c the conclusion was scarcely intelligible from increasing fright for she found that mr under pretence of receiving the note was coming towards her you cannot think i mean to hurry you said he in an under voice perceiving the amazing with which she made up the note f you cannot think i have any such object do not hurry yourself i entreat oh i thank you x have quite done just done â t park will be ready in a moment â i am very much obliged â you â if you will be so good as to give that to the note was held out and must be taken and as instantly and with averted eyes walked towards the fireplace where sat the others he had nothing to do but to go in good earnest thought she had never known a day of agitation both of pain and pleasure but the pleasure was not of a sort to die with the day â for every would restore the knowledge of william s advancement whereas the pain she hoped would return no more she had no doubt that her note must appear excessively that the language would disgrace a child for her distress had allowed no arrangement but at least it would assure them both of her being neither imposed on nor gratified by mr s attentions end of the h k park volume the third chapter i had by no means foi mr when ihe awoke the next morning but she remembered the purport of her note and was not less sanguine as to its effect than she had been the night before if mr ford would but go away that was what she most earnestly desired â go and take his sister with him as he was to do and as he returned to on purpose to do and why it was not done already she could not devise for miss certainly wanted no delay had hoped in the course of his yesterday s visit to hear the day named but he had only spoken of their journey as what would take place ere long having so satisfactorily settled the conviction her note convey she could not but be astonished to see mr as she accidentally did coming up to the house and at an hour as early as the day before might have nothing to do with her but she must â old seeing him if possible and being then in her way ip stairs she resolved there to remain during the whole i his visit unless actually sent for and as mrs still in the house there seemed little danger of her wanted she sat some time in a good deal of agitation listening and fearing to be sent for every moment but is no footsteps approached the east room she grew gradually composed could sit down and be able to employ and able to hope that mr had come did would go without her being obliged to know any th xv i the matter t il park nearly half an hour had passed and she was growing very comfortable when suddenly the sound of a step in regular approach was heard â a heavy step an unusual step in that part of the house it was her uncle s she knew it as well as his voice she had trembled at it as often and began to tremble again at the idea of his coming up to speak to her whatever might be the subject it was indeed sir thomas who opened the door and asked if she were there and if he might come in the terror of his former occasional visits to that room seemed all renewed and she felt as if he were going to examine her again in french and english she was all attention however in placing a chair for him and trying to appear honoured and in her agitation had quite overlooked the of 
54,her apartment till he stopping short as he entered said with much surprise why have you no fire to day there was snow on the ground and she was sitting in a shawl she hesitated m am not cold sir â i never sit here long at this time of year but you have a fire in general no u how comes this about here must be some mistake i understood that you had the use of this room by way of making you perfectly comfortable in your bed chamber i know you cannot have a fire here is some great which must be it is highly unfit for you to sit â be it only half an hour a day without a fire you are not strong you are chilly your aunt cannot be aware of this would rather have been silent but being obliged to speak she could not forbear in justice to the aunt she loved best from saying something in which the words my aunt were i understand cried her uncle himself and not wanting to hear more â understand has always been an advocate and very for young people s being brought up without unnecessary field pa â very thing is also very hardy herself which of will influence her in her opinion of the wants of thâ and on account too i can perfectly com â i know what her sentiments have always heen the principle was good in itself hut it may have heen and i has been carried too far in your case i am aware that there has been sometimes in some points a distinction but i think too well of you to suppose you will ever harbour resentment on chat you have an understanding which will prevent you from receiving things only in part and judging partially by the event you will take in the whole of the past you will consider times persons and and you will feel that they were not least your friends who were and preparing you for that of condition which seemed to be your lot though their caution may prove eventually unnecessary it was kindly meant and of this you may be assured that every advantage of be doubled by the little and that may have been imposed i am sure you will not disappoint my opinion of you by failing at any time to treat your aunt with the respect and attention that are due to her but enough of this sit down my dear i must speak to you for a few minutes but i will not detain you long obeyed with eyes cast down and colour rising after a moment s pause sir thomas trying to suppress a â mile went on you are not aware perhaps that i have had a this morning i had not been long in my own room after breakfast when mr was shown in his errand you may probably conjecture s colour grew deeper and deeper and her uncle perceiving that she was embarrassed to a degree that made either speaking or looking up quite impossible turned away hia own eyes and without any farther pause proceeded in his account of mr s visit mr s business had been to declare himself the lover of make decided proposals for her and the sanction of the â a t van ld th place of her parents and lie had done it all so so openly so liberally so properly that sir thomas feelings moreover his own replies and his own to have been very much to the purpose was exceedingly happy to give the particulars of their conversation and little aware of what was passing in his niece s mind conceived that by such details he must be gratifying her fu more than himself he talked therefore for several minutes without s daring to interrupt him she had hardly even attained the wish to do it her mind was in too much confusion she had changed l er position and with her eyes fixed intently on one of the windows was listening to her uncle in the utmost and dismay for a moment he ceased but she had barely become conscious of it when rising from his chair he said and now having performed one part of my commission and shown you every thing placed on a basis the most assured and satisfactory i nay execute the remainder by prevailing on you to accompany me down stairs where though i cannot but presume on having been no companion myself i most submit to your finding one still better worth listening to mr as you have perhaps foreseen is yet in the house he is in my room and hoping to see you there there was a look a start an exclamation on hearing thia which astonished sir thomas but what was his increase of astonishment on hearing her exclaim â oh no sir i cannot indeed i cannot go down to him mr ought to know â he must know that â i told him enough yesterday to convince him â he spoke to me on this yesterday â and i told him without disguise that it very disagreeable to me and quite out of my power to n turn his good opinion i do not catch your meaning said sir thomas sitting down again out of your power to return his good what is all this i know he spoke to you yesterday and as far as i understand received as much encourage ment to proceed as a well judging young woman could permit herself to give i was very much pleased with what i collected to have been your behaviour on the occasion it â r f allowed a discretion highly to he commended but now when he has made his so properly and â what are your scruples now f you are mistaken sir â cried forced hy the anxiety of the moment 
55,even to tell her that he was wrong â you are quite mistaken how could mr say such a thing i gave him no encouragement yesterday on the contrary i told him â i cannot recollect my exact words â hut i am sure i told him that i would not listen to him that it was very unpleasant to me in every respect and that i him never to talk to me in that manner again i am sure i said as much as that and more and i should have said still more if i had heen quite certain of his meaning any thing seriously hut i did not like to he â i could not hear to he â more than might he intended i thought it might all pass for nothing with mm she could say no more her was almost gone am i to understand said sir thomas after a few moments silence that you mean to refuse mr yes sir refuse him yes sir mr upon what plea for what reason i â i cannot like him sir well enough to marry him this is very strange said sir thomas in a voice of calm displeasure there is something in this which my comprehension does not reach here is a young man wishing to pay his addresses to you with every thing to recommend him not merely in life fortune and character hut with more than common with address and conversation pleasing to every and he is not an acquaintance of to day you have now known him some time his sister moreover is your intimate friend and he has heen doing that for your which i should suppose would have heen almost sufficient recommendation to you had there heen no other it is very uncertain when my interest might have got william on he has done it already x â yes said in a faint voice and down with fresh shame and she did feel almost ashamed of herself after such a picture as her uncle had drawn for not liking mr you must have heen aware continued sir thomas presently â you must have heen some time aware of a in mr s manners to you this cannot have taken you hy surprise you must have observed his attentions and though you always received them very properly i have no accusation to make on that head i never perceived them to be unpleasant to yon i am half inclined to think that you do not quite know own feelings oh yes sir indeed i do his attentions were always â what i did not like sir thomas looked at her with deeper surprise this is beyond me said he this requires explanation young as you are and having seen scarcely any one it is hardly possible that your he paused and eyed her he saw her lips formed into a no though the sound was inarticulate but her face was like scarlet that however in so modest a girl might be very with innocence and choosing at least to appear satisfied he quickly added no no i know that is quite out of the question â quite impossible well there is nothing more to be said and for a few minutes he did say nothing he was deep in thought his niece was deep in thought likewise trying to and prepare herself against farther questioning she would rather die than own the truth and she hoped by reflection to herself beyond betraying it of the interest which mr s choice seemed to justify said sir thomas beginning again and very his wishing to marry at all so early is to me i am an advocate for early marriages where there are means in proportion and would have every young man with a sufficient income settle as soon after four and twenty as he can this is so much my opinion that i am sorry to think how little likely my own eldest son your cousin mr is to marry early but at present as far as i can judge matrimony makes no part of his plans or thoughts i wish he were more likely to fix here was a glance at i consider from his disposition and habits as much more likely to marry early than his brother he indeed i have lately thought has seen the woman he could love which i am convinced my eldest son has not am i right do you agree with me my dear yes sir it was gently but it was calmly said and sir thomas was easy on the score of the cousins but the removal of his alarm did his niece no service as her was confirmed his displeasure increased and getting up and walking about the room with a frown which could picture to herself though she dared not lift up her eyes he shortly afterwards and in a voice of authority said have you any reason child to think ill of mr s temper no sir she longed to add but of his principles i have but her heart sunk under the appalling prospect of discussion explanation and probably non conviction her ill opinion of him was founded on observations whidi for her cousins sake she could scarcely dare mention to their father maria and and especially maria were so in mr s that she could give his character such as she believed it without betraying them she had hoped that to a man uke her so so honourable so good the simple acknowledgment of settled dislike on her side would have been sufficient to her infinite grief she found it was not sir thomas came towards the table where she sat in trembling wretchedness and with a good deal of cold said it is of no use i perceive to talk to you we had better put an end to this most conference mr must not be kept longer waiting 
55,i will therefore only add as thinking it my duty to mark my opinion of your conduct that you have disappointed every expectation i had formed and proved yourself of a character the very reverse of what i had supposed for i had as i think my behaviour must have shown formed a very favourable opinion of you the period of my return to england had thought you peculiarly free from of temper self conceit and every tendency to that independence of spirit which so in modern days even in young women and which in young women is offensive and disgusting beyond all offence but you have now shown me that you can be wilful and perverse that you can and will decide for yourself without any consideration or deference for those who have surely some right to guide you â without even asking their advice you have shown yourself very very from any thing that i had imagined the advantage or disadvantage of your family â of your parents â your brothers and sisters â never seems to have had a moment s share in your thoughts on this occasion how they mi t be how they must in such an establishment for you is nothing to you you think only of yourself and because you do not feel for mr what a young heated fancy to be necessary for happiness you resolve to refuse him at once without wishing even for a little time to consider of it â a little more time for cool consideration and for really examining your own inclinations â and are in a wild fit of folly throwing from you such an opportunity of being settled in life nobly settled as will probably never occur to you again here is a young man of sense of character of temper of manners and of fortune exceedingly attached to you and seeking your hand in the most handsome and disinterested way and let me tell you that you may live eighteen years longer in the world without being addressed by a man of half mr s estate or a tenth part of bis merits gladly would i have bestowed either of my own daughters on him maria is nobly married but had mr sought s hand i should have given it to him with superior and more satisfaction than i gave maria s to mr rush worth after half a moment s pause â and i should have been very much surprised had either of my daughters on a iq â al of at any time which might carry with it only aa f the of this immediately and and without paying my opinion or my regard the compliment of any consultation put a decided negative on it i should have been much surprised and much hurt by such a proceeding i should have thought it a gross of duty and respect tou are not to be judged by the same rule you do not owe me the duty of a child but if your heart can you of ingratitude he ceased was by this time crying so bitterly that as he was he would not press that article farther her heart was almost broken by such a picture of what she appeared to him by such so heavy so multiplied so rising in dreadful self willed obstinate selfish and ungrateful he thought her all this she had deceived his expectations she had lost his good opinion what was to become of her am very said she through her tears i am very sorry indeed sorry yes i hope you are sorry and you will probably have reason to be long sorry for this day s transactions if it were possible for me to do otherwise said she with another strong effort â but i am so perfectly con that i could never make him happy and that i should be miserable myself another burst of tears but in spite of that burst and in spite of that great black word miserable which served to introduce it sir thomas began to think a little ing a little change of inclination might have something to do with it and to from the personal entreaty of the young man himself he knew her to be very timid and exceedingly nervous and thought it not probable that her mind might be in such a state as a little time a little pressing a little patience and a little a judicious mixture of all on the lover s side might work their usual on if the gentleman would but â if he had but love enough to â sir thomas began to have hopes and these reflections having passed across his mind and cheered it y ns i s park a tone of becoming bnt of less anger â weu child dry up your tears there is no use in these tears they can do no good i must now come down stairs with me mr has been kept waiting too long already you must give him your own answer we cannot expect him to be satisfied with less and you only can explain to him the grounds of that of your which unfortunately for himself he certainly has i am totally unequal to it but showed such reluctance such misery at the idea of going down to him that sir thomas after a little consideration judged it better to indulge her his hopes from both gentleman and lady suffered a small depression in consequence but when he looked at his niece and saw the state of feature and complexion which her crying had brought her into he thought there might be as much lo t as gained by an immediate interview with a few words â therefore of no particular meaning he walked off by him self leaving his poor niece to sit and cry over what had passed with very wretched feelings her mind was all disorder 
55,the present future every thing was terrible but her uncle s anger gave her the pain of all selfish and ungrateful to have appeared so to him she was miserable for ever she had no one to take her part to counsel or speak for her her only friend was absent he might have softened his father but all perhaps all would think her selfish and she might have to endure the reproach again and again she might hear it or see it or know it to exist for ever in every connection about her she could not but feel some resentment against mr yet if he really loved her and were unhappy too â it was all wretchedness together in about a quarter of an hour her uncle returned she was almost ready to faint at the sight of him he spoke calmly however without without reproach and she revived a little there was comfort too in his words as well as his manner for he began with mr is gone he has just left me i need not repeat what has paused i do not want to a an may now s be feelings by an account of what he has felt suffice it that he has behaved in the most gentleman like and generous manner and has confirmed me in a most favourable opinion of his understanding hearty and temper upon my representation of what you were suffering he immediately and with the greatest delicacy ceased to urge to see you for the present here who had looked up looked down again of course continued her uncle it cannot be supposed but that he should request to speak with you alone be it only for five minutes a request too natural a claim too just to be denied but there is no time fixed perhaps tomorrow or whenever your spirits are composed enough the present you have only to yourself check these tears they do but you if as i am willing to suppose you wish to show me any you will not give way to these emotions but endeavour to reason yourself into a stronger frame of mind i advise you to go out the air will do you good go out for an hour on the gravel you will have the to yourself and will be the better for air and exercise and turning back again for a moment i shall make no mention below of what has passed i shall not even tell your aunt there is no occasion for spreading the disappointment say nothing about it yourself this was an order to be most joyfully obeyed this was an act of kindness which felt at her heart to be spared from her aunt s interminable reproaches â he left her in a glow of gratitude any thing might be rather than such reproaches even to see mr would be less overpowering she walked out directly as her uncle recommended and followed his advice throughout as far as she could did check her tears did earnestly try to compose her spirits and strengthen her mind she wished to prove to him that she did desire his comfort and sought to regain his favour v and he had given her another strong motive for exertion in keeping the whole affair from the knowledge of her not excite suspicion by her look or manner j park now an object worth and she felt equal to almost any thing that might save her from her aunt she was struck quite struck when on returning from her walk and going into the east room again the first thing which caught her eye was a fire lighted and burning a fire it seemed too much just at that time to be giving her such an indulgence was exciting even painful gratitude she wondered that sir thomas could have leisure to think of such a again but she soon found from the information of the who came in to attend it that so it was to be every day sir had given orders for it i must be a brute indeed if i can be really ungrateful said she in heaven defend me from being ungrateful she saw nothing more of her nor of her till they met at dinner her uncle s behaviour to her was then as nearly as possible what it had been before she was sure he did not mean there should be any change and that it was only her own conscience that could fancy any but her aunt was soon quarrelling with her and when she found how much and how her having only walked out without her aunt s knowledge could be dwelt on she felt all the reason she had to bless the kindness which saved her from the same spirit of reproach exerted on a more momentous subject if i had known you were going out i should have got you just to go as far as my house with some orders for said she which i have since to my very great inconvenience been obliged to go and carry myself i could very ill spare the time and you might have saved me the trouble if you would only have been so good as to let us know you were going out it would have made no ence to you i suppose whether you had walked in the or gone to my house i recommended the to as the place said sir thomas oh said mrs with a moment s check that was very kind of you sir thomas but you do not know ji park s the f ig to my house would have had good a walk there i assure you with the of some use and obliging her aunt it is all if she would but have let us know she was go but there is a something about i have often it before â she likes 
55,to go her own way to work j not like to be dictated to she takes her own walk whenever she can she certainly has a little secrecy and independence and nonsense about ch i would advise her to get the better of general reflection on sir thomas thought could be more unjust though he had been so pressing the same sentiments himself and he tried he conversation tried repeatedly before he could for mrs had not enough to either now or at any other time to what degree ht well of his niece or how very far he was from to have his own children s merits set off by the ion of hers she was talking at and private walk half through the dinner i over however at last and the evening set in e composure to and more cheerfulness of she could have hoped for after so stormy a but she trusted in the first place that she had ht that her judgment had not her for ty of her intentions she could answer and she ng to hope secondly that her uncle s displeasure ing and would farther as he considered the ith more and felt as a good man ly how wretched and how how and how wicked it was to marry without meeting with which she was threatened for ow was past she could not but flatter herself that ct would be finally concluded and mr le from that every thing would soon no such subject had existed she would not t b that mr s affection for her him long his mind was not of that sort soon bring its cure in london be st soon learn to wonder at his and be for the right reason in her which had saved him from evil consequences while s mind was engaged in these sort of hopes her uncle was soon after tea called out of the room an occurrence too common to strike her and she thought nothing of it till the butler re appeared ten minutes after wards and advancing decidedly towards herself said sir thomas wishes to speak with you ma am in his own room then it occurred to her what might be going on a suspicion rushed over her mind which drove the from her cheeks but instantly rising she was preparing to obey when mrs called out stay stay what are you about where are you going don t be in such a hurry depend upon it it is not you that wanted depend upon it it is me looking at the butler but you are so very to put yourself forward whit sir thomas want you for it is me you mean i am coming this moment you mean i am sure sir thomas wants me not miss price but was stout no ma am it is miss price i am certain of its being miss price and there was a half smile with the words which meant i do not think you would answer the purpose at all mrs much discontented was obliged to compose herself to work again and walking off in consciousness found herself as she anticipated in an other minute alone with mr chapter ii the conference was neither so short nor so as the lady had designed the gentleman was not so easily satisfied he had all the disposition to that sir thomas could wish him he had vanity which strongly inclined him in the e i â â did love him s though she might not know it herself and which secondly when constrained at last to admit that she did know her own present feelings convinced him that he should he in time to make those feelings what he wished he was in very much in love and it was a love which on an active sanguine spirit of more than delicacy made her affection appear of greater consequence it was withheld and determined him to have the glory as well as the felicity of forcing her to love him he would not despair h would not he had every well reason for solid attachment he knew her to have all the worth that could justify the warmest hopes of lasting happiness with her her conduct at this very time hy speaking the and delicacy of her character qualities which he most rare indeed was of a sort to all his wishes and confirm all his resolutions he knew not that he had a heart to attack of that he had no suspicion he considered her rather as one who had never thought on the subject enough to be in danger who had been guarded by youth a youth of mind as lovely as of person whose modesty had prevented her from understanding his attentions and who was still overpowered by the suddenness of addresses so wholly unexpected and the novelty of a situation which her fancy had never taken into account must it not follow of course that when he was understood he should succeed â he believed it fully love such as his in a man like himself must with perseverance secure a return and at no great distance and he had so much delight in the idea of obliging her to love him in a very short time that her not loving him now was scarcely regretted a little difficulty to be overcome was no evil to henry he rather derived spirits from it he had been apt to gain hearts too easily his situation was new and to however who had known too much opposition all her life to find any charm in it all this wa she found that he did mean to t v but how he could after such language from her as felt herself obliged to use was not to be understood she told that e did not love him could not love him was sure she never should love him that 
56,such a change was quite impossible that the subject was most painful to her that she must entreat him never to mention it again to allow her to him at once and let it be considered as concluded for ever and when farther pressed bad added that in her opinion their dispositions were so totally as to make mutual affection and that they were for each other by nature education and habit all this she had said and with the earnestness of sincerity yet this was not enough for he immediately denied there being any thing in their characters or any thing in their situations and declared that he would still love and still hope knew her own meaning but was no judge of hei own manner her manner was gentle and die was not aware how much it concealed the of her purpose her gratitude and softness made every expression of indifference seem almost an effort of self denial seem at least to be giving nearly as much pain to herself as to him mr was no longer the mr who as the admirer of maria had been her whom she had hated to see or to speak to in whom she could believe no good quality to exist and whose power even of being agreeable she had hardy he was now the mr who was addressing herself with ardent disinterested love whose were apparently become all that was honourable and upright whose views of happiness were all fixed on t of attachment who was pouring out his sense of her merits describing and describing again his proving as far as words could prove it and in the language tone and spirit of a man of talent too that be sought her for her gentleness and her goodness and to complete the whole he was now the mr who had procured william s promotion here was a change and here were claims which could park but operate she might have him in all the dignity of angry virtue in the grounds of or the theatre at park but he approached her now y rights that demanded different treatment she must be courteous and she must be compassionate she must have a sensation of being honoured and whether thinking of herself or her brother she must have a strong feeling of gratitude the of the whole was a manner so pitying and agitated and words with her refusal so expressive of obligation and concern that to a temper of vanity and hope like s the truth or at least the strength of her indifference might well be question able and he was not so as considered him in the professions of and not attachment which closed the interview it was with reluctance that he her to go but there was no look of despair in parting to his words or give her hopes of his being less unreasonable than he professed himself now she was angry some resentment did arise at a perseverance so selfish and here was again a want of delicacy and regard for others which had formerly so struck and disgusted her here was again a something of the same mr whom she had so before how evidently was there a gross want of feeling and humanity where his own pleasure was concerned and alas how always known no principle to supply as a duty what the heart was deficient in had her own affections been as free â as perhaps they ought to have been â he never could have engaged them so thought in good truth and sober sadness as she sat musing over that too great indulgence and luxury df a fire upstairs â wondering at the past and present won at what was yet to come and in a nervous agitation which made nothing clear to her but the persuasion of her he ing never under any circumstances able to and the felicity of having a fire to sit over and think of it sir thomas was obliged or obliged himself to wait till e morrow for a knowledge of what had passed between e people he then saw mr n oi xi c u park his account the first feeling was disappointment he had hoped better things he had thought that an hour s entreaty from a young man like could not ha e worked so little change on a gentle tempered girl like but there was speedy comfort in the determined and sanguine perseverance of the lover and when seeing confidence of success in the principal sir thomas was soon able to depend on himself nothing was omitted on his side of civility ment or kindness that might assist the plan mr ford s was honoured and was praised and the connection was still the most desirable in the world at park mr would always be welcome he had only to consult his own judgment and feelings as to the of his visits at present or in future in all the niece s family and friends there could be but one opinion one wish on the subject the of all who loved her must incline one way â very thing was said that could encourage every received with grateful joy and the gentlemen parted the best of friends satisfied that the cause was now on a footing the meet proper and hopeful sir thomas resolved to from all farther with his niece and to show no open interference upon her disposition he believed might be the best way of working â should be from one quarter only the forbearance of her family on a respecting which she could be in no doubt of their wishes might be their means of it accordingly on this principle sir thomas took the first opportunity of saying to her with a mild gravity intended to be i have seen mr again and learn from him exactly how matters stand between he is a extraordinary young 
56,man and whatever be the event you must feel that you have created an attach ment of no common character though young as you are and little acquainted with the transient varying unsteady nature of love as it generally exists you cannot be struck as i am with all that is wonderful in a perseverance of sort against u is entirely ter of feeling he no merit in it perhaps is to none yet having chosen so well his constancy a respectable stamp had his choice been less i should have condemned his indeed sir said i am very sorry that mr should continue to â i know that it is paying me great compliment and i feel most but i am so perfectly convinced and i have told i so that it never will be in my power my dear interrupted sir thomas there is no for this your feelings are as well known to me as wishes and regrets must be to you there is nothing re to be said or done from hour the subject is er to be revived between us you will have nothing ear or to be agitated about you cannot suppose me able of trying to persuade you to marry against your your happiness and advantage are all that i e in view and nothing is required of you but to bear h mr s to convince you that they f not be with his he proceeds at his own you are on safe ground i have engaged for your ing him whenever he calls as you might have done had of this sort occurred you will see him with the of us in the same manner and as much as you the recollection of every thing unpleasant he so soon that even this slight cannot be often demanded the future must be very and now my dear this subject is closed us the promised departure was all that could think with much satisfaction her uncle s kind expressions and manner were sensibly felt and en she considered how much of the truth was unknown she believed she had no right to wonder at the line conduct he pursued he who had married a daughter romantic delicacy was certainly not to expected from him she must do her duty and trust t time might make her duty easier than it now was he could not though only eighteen suppose mr attachment would hold out for â ii v but imagine that steady hem herself would put an end to it in time how much time she might in her own fancy for its dominion it another concern it would not be fair to into t young lady s exact estimate of her own in spite of his intended silence sir thomas found him self once more to mention the to his niece to prepare her briefly for its being imparted to her a measure which he would still have avoided if but which became necessary from the totally opposite feel of mr as to any secrecy of proceeding he had no idea of concealment it was all known at the where he loved to talk over the future with both his sisters and it would be rather gratifying to him to have enlightened witnesses of the progress of his success sir thomas understood this he felt the necessity of making his own wife and sister in law acquainted with the business without delay though on s account he almost dreaded the effect of the communication to mrs as much as herself he her mistaken but well meaning zeal sir thomas indeed was by this time not very far from mrs as one of those well meaning people who are always doing mistaken and very disagreeable things mrs however relieved him he pressed for the forbearance and silence towards their niece she not only promised but did observe it she only looked her increased ill will angry she was bitterly angry but she was more angry with for having received such an than for refusing it it was an injury and to who ought to have been mr s choice and of that she because she had neglected her and she would have such an elevation to one whom she had been always trying to sir thomas gave her more credit for discretion on tbe occasion than she deserved and could have blessed her for allowing her only to see her displeasure and not to hear it lady took it differently she had been a beauty and a eâ i ii va â s d park and wealth were all that excited her respect to to be sought in marriage by a man of f tune raised her therefore very much in her opinion by convincing her that was very pretty which she had been doubting about before and that she would be married it made her a sort of credit in calling her niece well said she as soon as they were alone together afterwards â and she really bad known something like impatience to be alone with ber and her countenance as she spoke had extraordinary animation â well i have had a very agreeable surprise this morning i must just speak of it i told sir thomas i must once and then i shall have done i give you joy my dear niece and looking at her complacently she added â we certainly are a handsome family coloured and doubted at first what to say when hoping to her on her side she presently answered â my dear aunt you cannot wish me to do differently from what i have done i am sure you cannot wish me to marry for you would miss me should not you â yes i am sure you would miss me too much for that no my dear i should not think of missing you when such an offer as this comes in your way 
56,i could do very well without you if you were married to a man of such good estate as mr and you must be aware that it is every young woman s duty to accept such a very offer as this this was almost the only rule of conduct the only piece of advice which had ever received from her in the course of eight years and a half it silenced her she felt how would be if her aunt s feelings were against her nothing could be hoped from attacking her understanding lady quite i will tell you what said she â i am sure he fell in love with you at die ball i am sure the mischief was done that evening you did look remarkably well every body said so â v â park and yoa know you bad to help you i am very glad i sent to yon i shall sir thomas that i am sure it was done that evening and still pursuing the same cheerful thoughts she soon wards added â and i will tell you what which is more than i did for maria â the next time has a litter you shall have a ib k if chapter iii had great things to hear on his return many surprises were awaiting him the first that occurred was not least in interest â the appearance of henry and his sister walking together through the village as he rode into it he had concluded â he had meant them to he far distant his absence had been extended beyond a fortnight purposely to avoid miss he was returning to with spirits ready to feed on melancholy and tender associations when her own fair self was before him leaning on her brother s arm and he found himself ing a welcome unquestionably friendly from the woman whom two moments before he had been thinking of as seventy miles off and as farmer much farther from him in inclination than any distance could express her reception of him was of a sort which he could not have hoped for had he expected to see her coming as he did from such a purport fulfilled as had taken him away he would have expected any thing rather than a look of satisfaction and words of simple pleasant mean ing it was enough to set his heart in a glow and to bring him home in the state for feeling the full value of the other joyful surprises at hand william s promotion with all its particulars he was soon master of and with such a secret provision of com fort within his own breast to help the joy he found in it park source of gratifying sensation and all dinner time after dinner when he and his father were alone he ad s history and then all the great events of the fortnight and the present situation of matters at were known to him suspected what was going on they sat so longer than usual in the dining parlour that she v as sure they must be talking of her and when tea lt last brought them away and she was to be seen by again she felt guilty he came to sat down by her took her hand and pressed it and at that moment she thought that but for the and the scene which the tea things afforded ihe must have betrayed her emotion in some excess he was not intending however by such action to be conveying to her that approbation and en which her hopes drew from it it was designed only to express his in all that interested her and to tell her that he had been hearing what quickened every feeling of affection he was in fact entirely on his father s side of the question his surprise was not so great as his father s at her refusing because so far from supposing her to consider him with any thing like a preference he had always believed it to be rather the reverse and could imagine her to be taken perfectly unprepared but sir thomas could not regard the connection as more desirable than he did it had every recommendation to him and while her for what she had done under the influence of her present indifference her in rather stronger terms than sir thomas could quite echo he was most earnest in hoping and sanguine in believing that it would be a match at last and that united by mutual affection it would appear that their dispositions were as exactly fitted to make them blessed in each other as he was now begin seriously to consider them had been too he had not given her time to attach herself he had begun at the wrong with â a y park his however and such a disposition as â trusted that every thing would work out a happy sion meanwhile he saw enough of s to make him guard against it a second time by any word or look or movement called the next day and on the score of s return sir thomas felt himself more than to ask bim to stay dinner it was really a necessary compliment he staid of course and â had then ample opportunity for observing how he sped with and what degree of immediate encouragement for him might be extracted from her manners and it was so little so very very little every chance every possibility of it resting upon her embarrassment only if there was not hope in her confusion there was hope in nothing else that he was almost ready to wonder at his friends perseverance was worth it all he held her to be worth every effort of patience every exertion of mind â but he did not think he could have gone on himself with any woman breathing without something more to warm his courage than his eyes 
56,discern in hers he was very willing to hope that saw clearer and this was the most comfortable conclusion for bis friend that he could come to from all that he observed to pass before and at and after dinner in the evening a few circumstances occurred which he thought more promising when he and walked into the drawing room mother and were sitting as intently and silently at work as if there were nothing else to care for could not help noticing apparently deep tranquillity we have not been so silent all the time replied his mother has been reading to me and only put the book down upon hearing you coming and sure enough there was a book on the table which had the of being very closed a volume of she often reads to me out of those books and she was in the middle of a very fine speech of that man s â what s his name â when we heard your footsteps took the me have the pie park â are of finishing that speech to your said he i shall find it immediately and hy giving way to the inclination of die leaves be did find it or within a page or two quite near enough to satisfy lady who assured him as soon as he mentioned the of cardinal that he had got the speech not a look or an offer of help had given not a syllable for or against all her attention was for her work she seemed determined to be interested by nothing but taste was too strong in her she could not abstract her mind five minutes she was forced to listen his reading was capital and her pleasure ia good reading extreme to good reading however she bad been long used her uncle read well â her ill â very well but in mr s reading here was a variety of excellence beyond what she had met with the king the queen all were given in turn for with the the happiest power of jumping and guess ng he could always light at will on the best scene ir the best speeches of each and whether it were dignity â r pride or tenderness or remorse or whatever were to be expressed he could do it with equal beauty it was dramatic his acting had first taught what a play might give and his reading brought all his before her again nay perhaps greater enjoy for it came unexpectedly and with no such draw back as she had been used to suffer in seeing him on the stage with miss watched the progress of her attention and was amused and gratified by seeing how she gradually in the needle work at the seemed to occupy her totally how it fell from her hand while she sat motionless over it â and at last how the eyes which had appeared so to avoid him throughout the day were turned and fixed on fixed on him for minutes fixed on him in short till the attraction drew s upon her and the book was closed and the charm was broken then she was shrinking again into herself and blushing and â s â it i but it had been enough to give encouragement bis friend and as he cordially thanked him he hoped to expressing s secret feelings too mt that play must be a with you said j you read as if you knew it well li it will be a favourite i believe from this hour m plied but i do not think i have had volume of in my hand before since i if fifteen i once saw henry the eighth acted â or i heard of it from somebody who did â i am not which but one gets acquainted with with out knowing how it is a part of an englishman i l constitution his thoughts and beauties are so spread e abroad that one touches them every where one is intimate e with him by instinct no man of any brain can open tt a good part of one of his plays without falling into the wn flow of his meaning immediately k no doubt one is familiar with in t degree said from one s earliest years his ij celebrated passages are quoted by every body they are in l half the books we open and we all talk use l his and describe with his descriptions but this is totally from giving his sense as you gave it l to know him in bits and scraps is common enough to l know him pretty thoroughly is perhaps not uncommon l but to read him well aloud is no every day talent l sir you do me honour was s answer with l a bow of mock gravity v both gentlemen had a glance at to see if a word i of praise could be from her yet both feeling that it could not be her praise had been given in her attention that must content them lady s admiration was expressed and strongly too it was really like being at a play said she i wish sir thomas had been here was excessively pleased if lady with all her and languor could feel this the of what her niece alive and enlightened as she was must feel was you have a great â fi it v a ix park said her soon afterwards and i what i think you will have a theatre some time at your house in i mean when you d there i do indeed i think you will fit up j at your house in you ma am cried he with quickness no will never he your is quite mistaken at j oh no and he looked f with an expressive smile which evidently meant will never allow a theatre at md saw it all and saw

more uncommon even than prayers well read a sermon good in itself is no rare thing it is more difficult to speak well than to com pose well that is the rules and trick of composition are oftener an object of study a thoroughly good sermon thoroughly well delivered is a capital gratification i can hear such a one without the greatest admiration and respect and more than half a mind to take orders and preach myself there is something in the eloquence of ihe pulpit when it is really eloquence which is entitled to the highest praise and honour the preacher who can and affect such an mass of hearers on limited and long worn thread bare in all common hands who can say any thing new or striking any thing that the attention without offending the ta te or wearing out the feelings of his hearers is a man whom one could not in his public capacity honour enough i should like to be such a man laughed i should indeed i never listened to a distinguished preacher in my life without a sort of envy but then i must have a london audience i could not preach but to ihe to those who were capable of my composition and i do not know that i should be fond of preaching often now and then perhaps once or twice in the spring after being anxiously expected for half a dozen sundays together but not for a constancy it would not do for a constancy here who could not but listen involuntarily shook her head and was instantly by her side again to know her meaning and as perceived by his drawing in a chair and sitting down close by her that it was to be a very thorough attack that looks and were to be weu tried he sank as quietly as possible into a corner turned his back and took up a newspaper very wishing that dear little ht be persuaded into explaining away that shake of the bead to the satisfaction of her ardent lover and as earnestly trying to bury every sound of the business from himself in murmurs of his own over the various of a most desirable estate in south wales â to parents

57,been obliged to tell you what he was trying for i wish he had known you as well as i do between us i think we should have won you my and his practical knowledge together could not have failed he should have worked upon my plans i must hope however that time proving him as firmly believe it will to deserve you by his steady affection will give him his reward i cannot suppose that you have not die to love him â the natural wish of gratitude you must have some feeling of that sort you must be sorry for your own indifference we are so totally unlike said avoiding a direct we are so very very z park our and ways that i consider it as quite impossible we should ever be tolerably happy even if i like him there never were two people more we not one taste in common we should be miserable you are mistaken the is not so strong you are quite enough alike you tastes in common you have moral and literary tastes in com mon you have both warm hearts and benevolent and who that heard him read and saw oa listen to the other night will think you as companions you forget yourself there is i decided difference in your i allow he is lively you are serious but so much the better his spirits will support yours it is your disposition to be easily dejected and to fancy difficulties greater than they are his cheer will this he sees difficulties no where and his and gaiety will be a constant support to you your being so far unlike does not in the smallest degree make against the probability of your hap together do not imagine it i am myself con that it is rather a favourable circumstance i am perfectly persuaded that the had better be unlike i mean unlike in the flow of the spirits in the manners in the inclination much or little company in the to talk or to be silent to be grave or to be gay some opposition here is i am thoroughly convinced friendly to matrimonial happiness i extremes of course and a very close resemblance in all those points would be the way to produce an extreme a gentle and continual is the best of manners and conduct full weu could guess where his thoughts were now miss s power was all returning he bad been speaking of her from the hour of bis coming home his avoiding her was quite at an end he had dined at the only the preceding day after leaving him to his happier thoughts for some mi it due to herself returned to mr and aa d it u not i â ni in temper that i him as totally to myself though in that â i think the difference between us too great too great his spirits often me â but there is something in him which i object to still more i must cousin that i cannot approve his character i have not thought well of him from the time of the play i then saw him as it appeared to me so very and â i may speak of it now because it is all over â so by poor mr not seeming to care how he exposed or hurt him and paying attentions to my cousin maria which â in short at the of the play i received an impression which will never be got over my dear replied scarcely hearing her to the end let us not any of us be judged by what we appeared at that period of general folly the time of the play is a time which i hate to recollect maria was wrong was wrong we were all wrong together but none so wrong as myself compared with me all the rest wâ i was playing the fool with my eyes open as a by said perhaps i saw more you did and i do think that mr was sometimes very jealous very possibly no wonder could be more improper than the whole business i am shocked whenever i think that maria could be capable of it but if she could undertake the part we must not be surprised at the rest before the play i am much mistaken if u ia did not think he was paying her attentions â i have heard e from some one of his being in love with but i could never see anything of it and though i hope i do justice to my sisters good qualities i think it very possible that they might one or both be more desirous of being admired by and might show that desire rather more than was perfectly prudent i can remember that they were evidently fond of his society and with such encourage x s park ment a man like lively and it may be a little mm might be led on to â there could be nothing iii very striking because it is clear that he bad no lions his heart was reserved for and i must that its being for you has raised him in my opinion it does him the highest honour it shows m proper estimation of the blessing of domestic happiness and pure attachment it proves him by his uncle it proves him in short every thing that i had been used to wish to believe him and feared he was not i am persuaded that he does not think as he ou t on serious subjects say rather thai he has not thought at au upon serious subjects which i to be a good deal the case how could it be otherwise with such an education and adviser under the indeed which both have had is it not wonderful that they should be what they are s feelings i am ready to acknowledge have hitherto 
58,been too much his guides happily those feelings have generally been good you will supply the rest and a most fortunate man he is to attach himself to such a creature â to a woman who firm as a rock in her own principles has a gentleness of character so well adapted to recommend them he has chosen his partner indeed rare felicity he will make you happy i know he will make you happy but you will make him every thing i would not engage in such a cried in a shrinking accent â mn such an office of high as usual believing yourself unequal to anything â every thing too much for you though i may not be able to persuade you into different feelings you will be persuaded into them i trust i confess myself sin anxious that you may i have no common interest in s well doing next to your happiness his has the first claim on me you are aware of my having no common interest in was too well aware of it to have any thing to park sl and they walked on tc some fifty yards in mutual silence and abstraction first began â i was yery much pleased by her manner of speaking of it yesterday particularly pleased because i had not depended upon her seeing every thing in so just a light i knew she was very fond of you but yet i was afraid of her not your worth to her brother quite as it and of her that he had not rather fixed on some woman of distinction or fortune i was afraid of the bias of those worldly which she has been too much used to hear but it was very different she spoke of you just as she ought she desires the connection as warmly as your uncle or myself we had a long talk about it j should not have mentioned the subject though very anxious to know her sentiments but i had not been in the room five minutes before she began introducing it with all that of hearty and sweet peculiarity of manner that spirit and which are so much a part of herself mrs grant laughed at her for her rapidity was mrs grant in the room then yes when i reached the house i found the two sisters together by themselves and when once we had begun we had not done with you till and dr grant came in it is above a week since i saw miss yes she it yet owns it may have been best you will see her however before she goes she is very angry with you you must be prepared for that she calls herself very angry but you can imagine her anger it is the regret and disappointment of a sister who thinks her brother has a right to every thing he may wish for at the first moment she is hurt as you would be for william but she loves and you with all her heart i knew she would be very angry with me my dearest cried pressing her arm to him do not let the idea of her anger distress you it is anger to be talked of rather than felt park heart it made for love and kindness not for resentment i with you could have overheard her tribute of praise i wish you could have seen her countenance when she said that you â tf be henry s wife and i observed that always spoke of you as which she was never used to do and it had a sound of most cordiality and mrs grant did she say â did she speak â the there all the time yes she was agreeing exactly with her sister the surprise of your refusal seems to have been unbounded that you could such a man as henry more than they can understand i said what i could for you but in good truth as they stated the case â you must prove yourself to be in your senses u â as you can by a different conduct nothing else will satisfy them but this is you i have done do not turn away from me i have thought said after a pause of and exertion that every woman must felt the possibility of a man s not being approved not being loved by some one of her sex at least let him be ever so generally agreeable let him have all the in the world i think it ought not to be set down as certain that a man be acceptable to every woman he may happen to like himself but even supposing it is so allow ing mr to have all the claims which his sisters think he has how was i to be prepared to meet him with any feeling to his own he took me wholly by surprise i had not an idea that his behaviour to me before had any meaning and surely i was not to be teaching myself to like him only because he was taking what seemed very idle notice of me in my situation it would have been the extreme of vanity to be forming expectations on mr i am sure his sisters him aa they do must have thought it so supposing he had meant nothing how then was i to be â to be in love with him the moment he he was with me how was i to have an attachment at his service as soon as it was asked for his sisters should consider me as well as him the higher his deserts the more improper for me ever to thou t of him and and â we think very differ of the nature of women if they can imagine a woman bo â of an as this seems to imply my dear dear now i have the truth 
58,i know this to be the truth and most worthy of you are such feelings i had attributed them to you before i thought could understand you you have now given exactly the which i ventured to make for you to your mend and mrs grant and they were both better satisfied though your warm hearted friend was still run away with a little by the enthusiasm of her fondness for henry i told them that you were of all human creatures the one over whom habit had most power and least and that the very circumstance of the novelty of s addresses was against him their being so new and so recent was all in their that you could nothing that you were not used to and a great deal more to the same purpose to give them a knowledge of your character miss made us laugh by her plans of encouragement for her brother she meant to urge him to in the hope of being loved in time and of having his addresses most kindly received at the end of about ten years happy marriage could with difficulty give the smile that was here asked r her feelings were all in revolt she feared she had been doing wrong saying too much the caution which she had been necessary in guarding against one evil laying herself open to another and to have miss s repeated to her at such a moment and on such a subject was a bitter saw weariness and distress in her face and resolved to forbear all farther discussion and pot even to mention the name of again except as it might be connected with what mu t be agreeable to her on this principle he soon afterwards observed â they go on monday you are sure therefore of seeing your friend either to morrow or sunday they really go on monday and i was a a iâ s sl persuaded to stay at till that very day i hi almost promised it what a difference it might have made those five or six days more at might have been felt au my ufe were near staying there very i was most kindly pressed and had nearly consented had i received any letter from to tell me how you were all going on i believe i should have stayed but i knew nothing that had happened here for a fortnight and felt that i had been away k enough you spent your time pleasantly there yes that is it was the fault of my own mind if did not they were all very pleasant i doubt their finding me so i took uneasiness with me and there was no getting rid of it till i was in again the miss â you liked them did not you yes very well pleasant good humoured unaffected girls but i am spoilt for common female society good humoured unaffected girls will not do for a man who has been used to sensible women they are two orders of being you and miss have made me too nice still however was oppressed and wearied be saw it in her looks it could not be talked away and attempting it no more he led her directly with the kind authority of a privileged guardian into the house chapter v now believed himself perfectly acquainted with all that could tell or could leave to be of her sentiments and he was satisfied it had been as he before presumed too hasty a measure on a and time must be given to make the idea first familiar and then agreeable to her she must be used to of his being in love with her and then m of affection might not he very distant gave this opinion as the result of the conversation to ther and recommended there being nothing more her no farther attempts to influence or persuade every thing should be left to s and the natural workings of her own mind thomas promised that it should be so s it of s disposition he could believe to be just posed she had all those feelings but he must consider ery that she for less willing than n to trust to the future he could not help fearing such very long of time and habit were for her she might not have persuaded herself into ng his addresses properly before the young man s for paying them were over there was nothing lone however but to submit quietly and hope the i promised visit from her friend as miss was a formidable threat to le lived in continual terror of it as a sister so so angry and so little scrupulous of what she said another light so triumphant and secure she was in way an object of painful alarm her displeasure and her happiness were all fearful to en t and the dependence of having others present they met was s only support in looking it she herself as little as possible from kept away from the east room and took no

began to hope there would be nothing to be endured than an half hour of moderate but here she hoped too much miss was e slave of opportunity she was determined to see r alone and therefore said to her tolerably w v a low i most to you for a few somewhere words that ah over her in all her and all her nerves denial was her habits of ready submission on the contrary made almost instantly rise and lead

58,was any thing quite like it another short fit of abstraction followed when shaking it off she thus attacked her companion why you are absolutely in a reverie thinking i hope of one who is always thinking of you oh that i could transport ow l at câ ft wa w in town that you ta g it m vo wâ henry is thought oi v xv x n ve â â park of and the wonder tlie f that will be felt at hearing what you have done for as to secrecy henry is quite the hero of an old romance and glories in his chains you should come to london to know how to estimate your conquest if you were to see how be is and how i am for his sake now i am well aware that i shall not be half so welcome to mrs in consequence of his situation with you when she comes to know the truth she will very likely wish me in again for there is a daughter of mr by a first wife whom she is wild to get married and wants henry to take oh she has been trying for him to such a degree innocent and quiet as you sit here you cannot have an idea of the sensation that you will be of the curiosity there will be to see you of the endless questions i shall have to answer poor margaret will be at me for ever about your eyes and your teeth and how you do your hair and who makes your shoes i wish margaret were married for my poor friend s sake for i look upon the to be about as unhappy as most other married people and yet it was a most desirable match for at the time we were all delighted she could not do otherwise than accept him for he was rich and she had nothing but he turns out ill and and wants a young woman a beautiful young woman of five twenty to be i steady as himself and my friend does not manage him well she does not seem to know how to make the best of it there is a spirit of irritation which to say nothing worse is certainly very in their house i shall call to mind the manners of with even dr grant does show a thorough confidence in my sister and a certain consideration for her judgment makes one feel there ft attachment but of that i shall see nothing with the i shall be at for ever my own as a wife sir thomas as a husband are my standards of perfection poor has been sadly w in and yet there was nothing improper v et did not run into the â â she took three da a to com e dâ park proposals and during those three days asked the of every body connected with her whose opinion was worth having and especially applied to my late dear whose knowledge of the world made her judgment very generally and looked up to by all the young people of her acquaintance and she was decidedly in favour of mr this seems as if nothing were a security for matrimonial comfort i have not so much to say for my friend who a very nice young man in the for the sake of that horrid lord who has about as much sense as mr but much worse looking and with a character i had my doubts at the time about her being right for he has not even the air of a gentleman and now i am sure she was wrong by the by was dying for henry the first winter she came out but were i to attempt to tell you of all the women whom i have known to be in love with him i should never have done it is you only you insensible who can think of him with any thing like indifference but are you so insensible as you profess yourself no no i see you are not there was indeed so deep a blush over s face at that moment as might warrant strong suspicion in a mind excellent creature i will not you every thing shall take its course but dear you must allow that you were not so absolutely unprepared to have the question asked as your cousin fancies it is not possible but that you must have had some thoughts on the subject some as to what might be you must have seen that he was trying to please you by every attention in his power was not he devoted to you at the ball and then before the ball the oh you received it just as it was meant you were as conscious as heart could desire remember it perfectly do you mean then that your brother knew of the beforehand oh miss that was not fair knew of it it was his own doing entirely his own thought i am ashamed to ax entered park head but i was delighted to act on his proposal for your i will not say replied that i was not half at the time of its being so for ere was something q your look that frightened me â but not at first â i was s of it at first â indeed indeed i was it s as true as that i sit here and had i had an idea of it should have induced me to accept the as x your brother s behaviour certainly i was sensible of a i had been sensible of it some time perhaps two or three weeks but then i considered it as meaning nothing i put it down as simply being his way ind was as far from supposing as from wishing him to have any serious thoughts of me i had not miss been an observer 
59,of what was passing be him and some part of this family in the summer and autumn i was quiet but i was not i could but see that mr allowed himself in which did mean nothing ah i cannot deny it he has now and then been a sad and cared very little for the he might be making in young ladies affections i have often him for it but it is his only fault and there is this to be said that very few young ladies have any worth caring for and then the glory of fixing one who has been shot at by so many of having it in one s power to pay off the debts of one s sex oh i am sure it is not in woman s nature to refuse such a triumph shook her head i cannot think well of a man who sports with any woman s feelings and there may often be a great deal more suffered than a by can judge of i do not him i leave him entirely to your mercy and when he has got you at i do not care how much you lecture him but this i will say that his fault the liking to make girls a little in love with him is not half so dangerous to a wife s happiness as a tendency to fall in love himself which he has never n to and i do seriously and truly believe that he is attached to you in a way that he never was to any before y he loves you with all his hearty and will love you as for ever as possible if any man ever loved a woman foe â ver i think henry will do as much for you could not avoid a faint smile but had say i cannot imagine henry ever to have been continued mary presently than when he had succeeded in getting your brother s commission she had made a sure push at s feelings here oh yes how very very kind of him i he must have exerted himself very much for i know the parties he had to move the admiral trouble and asking and there are so many young men s claims to be attended to in the same way that a friendship and energy not very determined is easily put by what a happy creature william must be i wish we could see him poor s mind was thrown into the most distressing of all its varieties the recollection of what had been done for william was always the most powerful of every decision against mr and she sat thinking deeply of it till mary who had been first watching her complacently and then on something else suddenly called her attention by saying i should like to sit with you here all day but we must not forget the ladies below and so good by my dear my my excellent for though we shall part in the breakfast parlour i must take leave of you here and i do take leave longing for a happy re union and that when we meet again it will be under circumstances which may open our to each other without any remnant or shadow of reserve a very very kind embrace and some agitation of manner accompanied these words i shall see your cousin in town soon he talks of being there soon and sir thomas i dare say in the course of the spring and your eldest cousin and the and i am sure of meeting again and again and all but you i have two to ask â one is your you must write to park me and the other that you will often call on mrs grant and make her amends for my being gone the first at of these would rather not have been asked but it was impossible for her to re the correspondence it was impossible for her even not to to it more readily than her own judgment there was no resisting so much apparent her disposition was peculiarly calculated to value a fond treatment and having hitherto so little of it she was the more overcome by miss ford s besides there was gratitude towards her for having made their d so much less painful her fears had predicted it was over and she had escaped without reproaches and without detection her secret was still her own and while that was the case she thought she could resign herself to almost every thing in the evening there was another parting henry came and sat some time with them and her spirits not being previously in the strongest state her heart was softened for a while towards him â because he really seemed to feel quite unlike his usual self he scarcely said any thing he was evidently oppressed and must grieve for him though hoping she might never see him again till he were the of some other woman when it came to the moment of parting he would take her hand he would not be denied it he said however or nothing that she heard and when he had left the room she was better pleased that such a token of friendship had passed on the morrow the were gone chapter vi mb gone sir thomas s next object was that he should be missed and he entertained great ho y park that his niece would find a blank in the loss of attentions which at the time she had felt or fancied an evil she had tasted of consequence in its most flattering form and he did hope that the loss of it the sinking again into nothing would awaken very wholesome regrets in her mind he watched her with this idea â bat he could hardly tell with what success he hardly knew whether there were any difference in her spirits or 
59,not she was always so gentle and retiring that her were beyond his he did not her he felt that he did not and therefore applied to ed to tell him how she stood affected on the present occasion and whether she were more or less happy than â he had been did not discern any symptom of regret and thought his father a little unreasonable in supposing the first three or four days could produce any what chiefly surprised was that s sister the friend and companion who had been so much to her should not be more visibly regretted he won that spoke so seldom of her and had so little voluntarily to say of her concern at this separation alas it was this sister this friend and companion who was now the chief of s comfort if she could have believed mary s future fate as with as she was determined the brother s should be if she could have hoped her return thither to be as distant as she was much inclined to think his she would been light of heart indeed but the more she recollected and observed the more deeply was she convinced that every thing was now in a fairer train for miss a marrying than it had ever been before on hia side the inclination was stronger on hers less his objections the scruples of his integrity seemed ad done away â nobody could tell how and the doubts and of her ambition were equally got and equally without apparent reason it could only be to increasing attachment his good and her bad feeling yielded to love and such love must unite them he waa to go to town aa soon aa some relative to ten was completed â perhaps within a fortnight â be talked of he loved to talk of it and when once with her again could not tlie rest her acceptance must he as certain as his and yet there were had feelings still remaining which made the prospect of it most sorrowful to her she of self in their very last conversation miss in spite of some sensations and much personal kindness had still been miss still shown a mind led astray and bewildered and without any suspicion of being so darkened yet itself light she might love but she did not deserve â by any other sentiment believed there was scarcely a second feeling in com mon between them and she may be forgiven by older for looking on the chance of miss s future improvement as nearly desperate for thinking that if s influence in this season of love had already done so little in clearing her judgment and her notions his worth would be finally wasted on her even in years of matrimony experience might have hoped more for any young people so and would not have denied to miss s nature that of the general nature of women which would lead her to adopt the opinions of the man she loved and respected as her own but as such were s she suffered very much from them and could never speak of miss without pain sir thomas meanwhile went on with his own hopes and his own observations still feeling a right by all his knowledge of human nature to expect to see the effect of the loss of power and consequence on his niece s spirits and the past attentions of the lover producing a craving for their return and he was soon afterwards able to account for his not yet completely and seeing all this by the prospect of another whose approach he could allow to be quite enough to support the spirits he was watching william had obtained a ten days leave of absence to be given to and was coming y park the happiest of because the latest made to show his happiness and describe his uniform he came and he would have been delighted to show his uniform there too had not cruel custom its appearance except on duty so the uniform remained at and that before had any chance of seeing it all its own freshness and au the freshness of its s feelings must be worn away it would be sunk into a of disgrace for what can be more or more worthless than the uniform of a lieutenant who has a lieutenant a year or two sees others made before him so reasoned till his father made him the of a scheme which placed s chance of seeing the d lieutenant of h m s in all his glory in another light this scheme was that she should accompany her brother back to and spend a little time with her own family it had occurred to sir thomas in one of his dignified as a right and desirable but before he absolutely made up his mind he consulted his son considered it every way and saw nothing but what was right the thing was good in itself and could not be done at a better time and he had no doubt of it being highly agreeable to this was enough to sir thomas and a decisive then so it shall be closed that stage of the business sir thomas retiring from it with some feelings of satisfaction and views of good over and above what he had communicated to his son for his prime motive in sending her away had very little to do with the propriety of her

swelling sort and though never a great she was always more inclined to silence when feeling most strongly at the moment she could only thank and accept afterwards when with the visions of enjoyment so suddenly opened she could speak more largely to william and of what she felt but still there were emotions of tenderness that could not be clothed in words the remembrance of all her earliest pleasures and of what she had suffered in being torn from them came over her with renewed strength and it seemed as if to be at home again would heal every pain that had since grown out of the separation to be in the centre of such a de loved by so many and more loved by all she had ever been before to feel affection without fear or restraint to feel herself the equal of who surrounded her

every thing supplied an amusement to the high glee of william s mind and he was full of and joke in the intervals of their higher toned subjects all of which ended if they did not begin in praise of the conjectures how she would be employed schemes for an action with some superior force which supposing the first out of the way â and william was not very to the first lieutenant was to give himself

which he had a strong right of interest being to commence his career of in her at this very time another moment and was in the narrow entrance passage of the house and in her mother s arms who met her there with looks of true kindness and with features which loved the more because they brought her aunt s before her and there were her two sisters a well fine girl of fourteen and the youngest of the family about five â both glad to see her in their way though with no advantage of manner in receiving her but manner did not want would they but love her she should be satisfied she was then taken

60,here is turning and leading her forward it is so dark you do not see her with an acknowledgment that he had quite forgot her mr price now received his daughter and having given her a cordial and observed that she was grown into a woman and he supposed would be wanting a husband soon seemed very much inclined to forget her again shrunk back to her seat with feelings sadly pained by his language and his smell of spirits and he talked on only to his son and only of the though william warmly interested as he was in that subject more than once tried to make his father think of and hear long absence and long journey after sitting some time a candle was obtained but as th e was stiu no appearance of tea nor from bet â s reports from the kitchen much hope of t â considerable period william determined to go and change his dress and make the necessary preparations for his removal on board directly that he might have his tea comfort afterwards as he left the room two rosy faced boys ragged and dirty about eight and nine years old rushed into it just released from school and coming eagerly to see their sister and tell that the was gone out of harbour tom and charles charles had been bom since s going away but tom she had often helped to nurse and now felt a particular pleasure in seeing again both were kissed very tenderly but tom she wanted to keep by her to try to trace the features of the baby she had loved and talked to of his infant preference of herself tom however had no mind for such treatment he came home not to stand and be talked to but to run about and make a noise and both boys had soon burst away from her and the parlour door till her temples ached she had now seen all that were at home there remained only two brothers between herself and one of whom was a clerk in a public office in london and the other on board an but though she had seen all the members of the family she had not yet heard all the noise they could make another quarter of an hour brought her a great deal more william was soon calling out from the landing place of the second story for his mother and for he was in distress for something that he bad left there and did not find again a key was accused of having got at his new hat and some slight but essential alteration of his uniform waistcoat which he had been promised to have done for him entirely neglected mrs price and all went up to defend themselves all talking together but and the job was to be done as well as it could in a great hurry william trying in vain to send down again or keep her from being troublesome where she was the whole of which as almost g aa v a could l e plainly di m ae â t â va â t ht intervals by the u v oi l m â wâ s t each other up and down stairs and tumbling about and was almost stunned the of the house and of the walls brought every thing so close tor her that added to the fatigue of her journey and all her recent agitation she hardly knew how to bear it the room all was tranquil enough for having with the others there were soon only her father and herself remaining and he taking out a newspaper the loan of a neighbour applied himself to studying it without seeming to recollect her existence the solitary was held between himself and the paper without any reference to her possible convenience but she had nothing to do and was glad to have the from her aching head as she sat in bewildered broken sorrowful contemplation she was at home but alas it was not such a home she had not such a welcome as â she checked herself she was unreasonable what right had she to be of importance to her family she could have none so long lost sight of william s concerns must be dearest â they always had been â and he had every right yet to have so little said or asked about herself â to have scarcely an made after it did pain her to have forgotten the friends who had done so much â the dear dear friends but here one subject swallowed up all the rest perhaps it must be so the destination of the must be now pre eminently interesting a day or two might show the she only was to blame yet she thought it would not have been so at no in her uncle s house there would have been a consideration of times and seasons a of subject a propriety an attention towards every body which there was not here the only interruption which thoughts like these received for nearly half an hour was from a sudden burst of her father s not at all calculated to compose them at a more than ordinary pitch of and in the pas sage he exclaimed devil take those do tbey are singing out ay sam s voice o aâ t ck i t t boy is fit for a lâ â â z â stop your confounded pipe or i shall be ate you this threat was so that within re minutes afterwards the three boys all burst into the room together and sat down could not consider it as a proof of any thing more than their being for the time thoroughly which their hot faces and panting seemed to prove â especially as they were still ing each other s and out at sudden starts immediately under their father s eye

61,a girl of fourteen acting only r own reason should in the method of a was not wonderful and soon became more to admire the natural light of the mind which so early distinguish justly than to censure severely of conduct to which it led was only the same truths and pursuing the same system l her own judgment acknowledged but which her and yielding temper would have shrunk from ing tried to be useful where she could only gone away and cried and that was useful she perceive that things bad as they were would have worse but for such and that both her r and were restrained from some of offensive indulgence and vulgarity every argument with her mother had in point son the advantage and never was there any maternal mess to buy her off the blind fondness which was er producing evil around her she had never known i was no gratitude for affection past or present to her better bear with its to the others this became gradually evident and gradually placed before her sister as an object of mingled compassion that her manner was wrong however at very wrong her measures often ill chosen and ill a a park timed and her looks and very often could not cease to feel but she began to hope thej might be she looked up to her and wished for her good opinion and new as any thing like an office of authority was to new as it was to imagine herself capable of guiding or informing any one she did resolve to give occasional hints to and endeavour to exercise for her advantage the notions of what was due to every body and what would be wisest for herself which her own more favoured education had fixed in her her influence or at least the consciousness and use of it originated in an act of kindness by which after many of delicacy she at last worked herself up to it had very early occurred to her that a small sum of money might perhaps restore peace for ever on the sore subject of the silver knife as it now was continually and the riches which she was in possession of her self her uncle having given her at parting made her as able as she was willing to be generous but she was so wholly unused to confer except on the very poor so in removing evils or among her equals and so fearful of appearing to herself as a great lady at home that it took some time to determine that it would not be in her to make such a present it was made however at last a silver knife was bought for and accepted with great delight its giving it every advantage over the other could be desired was established in the m possession of her own handsomely declaring that now she had got one so much prettier herself she should never want that again â and no reproach seemed conveyed to the equally satisfied mother which had almost feared to be impossible the deed thoroughly answered a source of domestic was entirely done away and it was the means of opening s heart to her and giving her something more to love and be interested in showed that she had delicacy pleased as she was to be mistress of property which she had been struggling for at least two years she yet feared that her sister s judgment park been against her and that a reproof was designed her for having so struggled as to make the purchase for the tranquillity the house her temper was open she acknowledged her fears herself for having so warmly and from that hour understanding the worth of her disposition and perceiving how fully she was inclined to seek her good opinion and refer to her judgment began to fed again the blessing of affection and to entertain the hope of being useful to a mind so much in need of help and so much deserving it she gave advice â advice too sound to be resisted by a good understanding and given so mildly and as not to an imperfect temper she had the happiness of observing its good effects not more was not expected by one who while seeing an the obligation and of submission and forbearance saw also with sympathetic of feeling that must be grating to a girl like her greatest wonder on the subject soon became â not that san should have been provoked into and impatience against her better knowledge â but that so much better knowledge so many good notions should have been hers at all and that brought up in the midst of and error she should have formed such proper opinions of what ought to be â she who had had no cousin to direct her thoughts or fix her principles the intimacy thus begun between them was a material advantage to each by sitting together up stairs they avoided a great deal of the disturbance of the house had peace and learnt to think it no misfortune to be employed they sat without a fire but that was a familiar even to and she the less because reminded by it of the east room it was the only point of resemblance in space light furniture and prospect there was nothing alike in the two apartments and she often heaved a sigh at the remembrance of all books and boxes and various comforts there by degrees the girls came to spend the chief of the morning up stairs at first only in working and talking but after a few days the remembrance of the said books grew so potent and a a that found it impossible not to try for books again there were none in her father s house but wealth is luxurious and daring and some of hers found its way to a library she 
62,became a amazed at being any thing in amazed at her own doings in every way to be a a of books and to be having any one s improvement in view in her choice but so it was had read nothing and longed to give her a share in her own first and inspire a taste for the biography and which she delighted in herself in this occupation she hoped moreover to bury some of the recollections of which were too apt to seize her mind if her fingers only were busy and at this time hoped it might be useful in her thoughts from pursuing to london whither on the authority of her aunt s last letter she knew he was gone she had no doubt of what would the pro was hanging over her head the post man s knock within the neighbourhood was beginning to bring its daily terrors and if reading could banish the idea for even half an hour it was something gained chapter x a week was gone since might be supposed in town and had heard nothing of him there were three different conclusions co be drawn from his silence between which her mind was in each of them at times being held the most probable either his going had been again delayed or he had yet procured no of seeing miss alone or he was too happy for letter writing one morning about this time having now been nearly four tâ â â jt si â he never failed to i eâ si i a fe â sâ n â it tt park and were preparing to remove as usual up stairs they were by the knock of a whom they felt they could not from s in going to the door a duty which always interested her beyond any other it was a gentleman s voice it was a voice that was just turning pale about when mr walked into the room good sense like hers will always act when really called upon and she found that she had been able to name him to her mother and recall her of the name as that of william s friend though she could not previously have believed herself capable of uttering a syllable at such a moment the consciousness of his being known there only as william s friend was some support having introduced him however and being all re seated the terrors that occurred of what this visit might lead to were overpowering and she fancied herself on the point of fainting away while trying to keep herself alive their who had at first approached her with as animated a ever was wisely and kindly keeping his eyes away and giving her time to recover while he devoted himself entirely to her mother addressing her and attending to her with the utmost politeness and propriety at the same time with a degree of friendliness of interest at least which was making his manner perfect mrs price manners were also at their best warmed by the sight of a friend to her son and regulated by die wish of appearing to advantage before liim she was overflowing with gratitude maternal gratitude whidi could not be mr price was out which she regretted very much was just recovered enough to feel that s e could not regret it for to her many other sources of uneasiness was added the severe one of shame for the home in which he foimd her she might herself for the weakness but there was no scolding it away she was ashamed and she would have been yet more of her father than o aw t v tâ â a a man park â they talked of william a subject on which mrs price could never tire and mr was as warm in his as even her heart could wish she felt she had never seen so agreeable a man in her life and only astonished to find that so great and so agreeable as he he should be come down to neither on a visit to the port admiral nor the nor yet with the intention of going over to the island nor of see ing the dock yard nothing of all that she had been used to think of as the proof of importance or the employment of wealth had him to he had reached it late the night before was come for a day or two was staying at the crown had accidentally met with a navy officer or two of his acquaintance since his arrival but had no object of that kind in coming by the time he had given all this information it was not unreasonable to suppose that might be looked at and spoken to and she was tolerably able to bear his eye and hear that he had spent half an hour with his sister the evening before his leaving london that she had sent her best and kindest love but had had no time for writing that he thought himself lucky in seeing mary for even half an hour having spent scarcely twenty four hours in london after his return from before he set off again that her cousin was in town had been in town he understood a few days that he had not seen him himself but that he was well had left them all well at and was to dine as yesterday with the listened even to the last mentioned circumstance nay it seemed a relief to her worn mind to be at any certainty and the words then by this time it is all settled passed without more evidence of emotion than a faint blush after talking a little more about a subject in which her interest was most apparent began to hint at the of an early walk it was a lovely morning and at that season of the year a fine morning so 
62,often turned off that it was wisest for every body not to delay their exercise x i y lie soon proceeded to a i s x a law park ice and ber daughters to take their walk without of me now they came to an understanding mrs price appeared scarcely stirred out of doors except on a die owned she could seldom with her large find time for a walk would she not then per her daughters to take advantage of weather nd allow him the pleasure of attending them f mrs rice was greatly obliged and very her were very much confined â was a ad place â they did not often get out and she knew hey had some errands in the town they would be glad to do and the consequence was that as it was â strange awkward and distressing â herself and within ten minutes walking towards the high street with mr it was soon pain upon pain confusion upon confusion tor they were hardly in the high street before they met father whose appearance was not the better from its saturday he and as he looked was obliged to introduce him to mr ford she could not have a doubt of the manner in mr be struck he must be ashamed and altogether he must soon give her up and cease to have the inclination for the match and yet thou she had been so much wanting his affection to be this was a sort of cure that would be almost as bad is the complaint and i believe is scarcely a young lady in the united who would not rather put up the misfortune of bâ ng sought by a clever agreeable than have him driven away by the vulgarity of her relations mr probably could not regard his future father in law with any idea of taking him for a model in but as instantly and to her great relief her was a very man a very different mr price in his behaviour to this most highly re stranger from what he was in his own family at his manners now though not polished were more they were grateful an mâ ed were those of ui attached ex â â â a man â liis load tones did very well in die open there was not a single oath to be heard was compliment to the good manners of mr and be the consequence what it mighty s immediate feelings were infinitely soothed the conclusion of the two gentlemen s was an offer of mr price s to take mr into the yard which mr desirous of accepting as a favour what was intended as such though he had seen the dock yard again and again and hoping to be so much the longer with was yery gratefully disposed to a himself of if the miss prices were not afraid of the and as it was somehow or other ascertained or inferred or at least acted upon that they were not at all afraid to the dock yard they were all to go and but for mr mr price would have turned thither directly without the smallest consideration for his daughter s errands in the high street he took care however that they should be allowed to go to the shops ey came out expressly to visit and it did not delay them long for could so little bear to excite impatience or be waited for that before the gentlemen as they stood at the door could do more than begin upon the last naval or settle the number of three now in commission their companions were ready to proceed they were then to set forward for the dock yard at and the walk would have been conducted according to mr s opinion in a singular manner had mr price been allowed the entire of it as the two girls he would have been left to follow and keep up with them or not as they could while they walked on u at their own hasty pace he was able to introduce some improvement occasionally though by no means to the extent he wished he absolutely would not walk away from them and at any crossing or any crowd when mr price was only calling out come girls â come fan â come take care of yourselves â keep a sharp look out he would give them his particular attendance once fairly in the dock yard he began to reckon upon some happy intercourse with as they were very soon park joined by a brother of mr price s who was come to take his daily survey of how things went on and must prove a far more worthy companion than himself and after a time the two officers seemed very well satisfied in going about together and discussing matters of equal and never failing interest while the young people sat down upon some in the yard or found a seat on board a vessel in the stocks which they all went to look at waa most conveniently in want of rest could not have wished her more fatigued or more ready to sit down but he could have wished her sister away a quick looking girl of s age was the very worst third in the world â totally different from lady â all eyes and ears and there was no introducing the main point before her he must content himself with being only generally agreeable and letting have her share of entertainment with the indulgence now and then of a look or hint for the better informed and conscious was what he had mostly to talk of there he had been some time and every thing there was rising in importance from his present schemes such a man could come from no place no society without something to amuse his journeys and his acquaintance were all of use and was 
62,entertained in a way quite new to her for somewhat more was related than the accidental of the parties he had been in for her ap the particular reason of his going into at all at this unusual time of year was given it had been real business relative to uie renewal of a lease in which the welfare of a large and he believed industrious family was at stake he had suspected his agent of some dealing â of meaning to bias him against the deserving â and he had determined to go himself and thoroughly investigate the merits of the case he had gone had done even more good than he had foreseen had been useful to more than his first plan had comprehended and was now able to congratulate himself upon it and to feel that in performing a duty he had secured agreeable recollections for his own mind he had introduced himself to some tenants whom he had never seen before he s t park had begun making acquaintance with cottages whose very existence though on his own estate had been hitherto unknown to him this was aimed and well aimed at it was pleasing to hear him speak so properly here he had been acting as he ought to do to be the friend of the poor and oppressed nothing m be more grateful to her and she was on the point of giving him an look when it was all frightened off by his adding a something too pointed of his hoping soon to have an a friend a guide in every plan of utility or charity for a somebody that would make am and all about it a dearer than it had ever been yet she turned away and wished he would not say such things she was willing to allow he might have more good qualities than she had been wont to suppose she began to feel the possibility of his turning out well at last bat he was and must ever be completely to her and ought not to think of her he perceived that enough had been said of and that it would be as well to talk of something else and turned to he could not have chosen better that was a topic to bring back her attention and her looks almost instantly it was a real indulgence to her to hear or to speak of now so long divided from every body who knew the place she felt it quite the voice of a friend when he mentioned it and led the way to her fond exclamations in praise of its beauties and comforts and by his honourable tribute to its inhabitants allowed her to gratify her own heart in the warmest in speaking of her as all that was clever and good and her aunt as having the sweetest of all sweet he had a great attachment to himself he said so he looked forward with the hope of spending much very much of his time there â always there or in the neighbourhood he particularly built upon a very happy summer and autumn there this year he felt that it would be so he depended upon it a summer and autumn infinitely superior to the last as animated aa as social â but with circumstances of indescribable i park he what a society will be in those houses and t perhaps a fourth may be added some small hunting box in the vicinity of every thing so dear â for as to any in as once good proposed i hope foresee two objections two fair excellent irresistible objections to that plan was doubly silenced here though when the moment was passed could regret that she had not forced herself into the acknowledged comprehension of one half of his and encouraged him to say something more of his sister and â it was a subject which she must learn to speak of and the weakness that shrunk from it would soon be quite when mr price and his friend had seen all that they wished or had time for the others were ready to return and in the course of their walk back mr contrived a minute s privacy for telling that his only business in was to see her that he was come down for a couple of days on her account and hers only and because he could not endure a longer total separation she was sorry really sorry and yet in spite of this and the two or three other things which she wished he had not said she thought him altogether improved since she had seen him he was much more gentle obliging and to other people s feelings than he had ever been at she had never seen him so agreeable â so near being agreeable his behaviour to her father could not offend and there was something particularly kind and proper in the notice he took of he was decidedly improved she wished the next day over she wished hie had come only for one day â but it was not so very bad as she would have expected the pleasure of talking of was so very great before they parted she had to thank him for another pleasure and one of no trivial kind her father asked him to do them the honour of taking his mutton with them and had time for only one thrill of horror before he declared himself prevented by a prior engage s e park ment he was engaged to dinner already both for that day and the next he had met with some acquaintance at the crown who would not be denied he should have the honour however of waiting on them again on the morrow c and so they parted â in a state of actual felicity from escaping so horrible an evil to have had him join their family dinner party and

63,for â having a little curiosity â and so i think has he though he will not acknowledge it this was a letter to be run through eagerly to be read deliberately to supply matter for much reflection

might act without or against her meaning â whether his importance to her were quite what it had been before the separation â whether if lessened it were likely to lessen more or to recover itself were

unsettled by it altogether by what had and what might come that her usual and with were much suspended she not her attention as she wished if mr remembered her message to her cousin she it it very likely mo t likely that he would write to all events it would be most consistent with his and till she got rid of this idea till it off by no letters appearing in the course of three ir days more she

alarmed and apprehensive for the poor invalid whose state sir thomas fears may be very and kindly attending his brother immediately but i am happy to add that r thomas â will not leave me on this distressing occasion as it would be too trying for me we shall greatly miss in our small circle but i trust and hope he will find the poor invalid in a less alarming state than might be apprehended and that he will be able to bring him to shortly which sir thomas should be done and thinks best on every account and i flatter myself the poor will soon be able to bear the removal without material

glad i should be if yon were here to comfort me but sir thomas hopes he will be better to morrow and says we must consider his journey the real solicitude now awakened in the maternal bosom was not soon over tom s extreme impatience to be removed to and experience those comforts of home and family which had been little thought of in health had probably induced his being conveyed thither too as a

proposal if he wanted he would send fox her and even to offer an early return was a presumption which hardly any thing have seemed to justify she thanked miss but gave a decided negative her wide she understood meant to fetch her and as her cousin s illness had continued so many weeks without her being thought at all necessary she must suppose her return would be at present and that she should be felt an her representation of her cousin s state at this time was exactly according to her own belief f it and such as she supposed would convey to the sanguine mind of her correspondent the hope of every thing she was wishing for would be forgiven for being a clergyman it seemed under certain conditions of and this she suspected was all the conquest of which he was so ready to congratulate upon she bad only learnt to nothing of ce but money chapter xv as could not doubt that her answer was conveying i real disappointment she was rather in expectation from her knowledge of miss s temper of being urged again and though no second letter arrived for the space of a week she had still the same feeling when it did come on receiving it she could instantly decide on its little writing and was persuaded of its having the air of a letter of haste and business its object was and two moments were enough to start tho probability of its being merely to give her notice that they should be in that

65,she dared not indulge a hope of the paragraph being miss s letter which she had so often as to make every line her own was in frightful with it her eager defence of her brother her hope of its being hushed up her evident agitation were all of a piece with something very bad and if there was a woman of character in existence who could treat as a trifle this sin of the first magnitude who could try to it over and desire to have it she could believe miss to be the woman now she could see her own mistake as to who were gone or said to be gone it was not mr and mrs it was mrs and mr seemed to herself never to have been shocked before there was no possibility of rest the passed without a pause of misery the night was totally sleepless she passed only from of sickness to of horror and from hot ts of fever to cold the event was so shocking that there were moments even when her heart from it as impossible when she thought it could not be a woman married only six months ago a

confusion of guilt too gross a of evil for human nature not in a state of utter to be capable of â yet her judgment told her it was so his unsettled affections wavering with his vanity decided attachment and no sufficient principle on either side gave it possibility â miss s letter it a fact man park what be the consequence whom would il not injure whose views mi t it not effect whose peace would it not cut up for ever miss her self â â but it was dangerous perhaps to tread such ground she confined herself or tried to confine herself to the simple r whidi must au if it were indeed a matter of guilt and public exposure the mother s the father s â there she paused s tom s â there a yet longer pause they were the two on whom it would fall most horribly sir thomas s parental solid and high sense of honour and decorum â a upright principles temper and genuine strength of feeling made her think it scarcely for them to support life and reason under such disgrace and it appeared to her that as far as this world alone was the greatest to every one of kindred with mrs would be instant nothing happened the next day or the next to her terrors two posts came in and brought no tion public or private there was no letter to plain away the first from miss there was no intelligence from though it was now full time for her to hear from her aunt this was an evil omen she had indeed the shadow of a hope to soothe her and was reduced to so low and wan and trembling a condition as no â not unkind except mrs price have overlooked when the third day did bring the sickening and a letter was put into her hands it bore the london and came from dear you know our present wretchedness may god support you under your share we have been here two days but there is nothing to be done they cannot be traced you may not have heard of the last s die is gone to scotland with she left london a few hours before we entered it at any other time this would have been felt dreadfully now it seem nothing yet it is a heavy my father is not park overpowered more cannot be hoped he is still able to think and act and i write by his desire to propose your returning home he is anxious to get you there for my mother s sake i shall be at the morning after you this and hope to find you ready to set off for my father wishes you to to go with you for a few months settle it as you like say what is proper i am sure you will feel such an instance of his kindness at such a moment do justice to his meaning however i may it you may imagine something of my present state there is no end of the evil let loose upon us you will see me early by the mail c never had more wanted a cordial never had she felt such a one as this letter contained to morrow to leave to morrow she was she felt she was in the greatest danger of being exquisitely happy while so many were miserable the evil which brought good to her i she dreaded lest she should learn to be insensible of it to be going so soon sent for so kindly sent for as a comfort and with leave to take was altogether such a combination of blessings as set her heart in a glow and for a time seemed to distance every pain and make her incapable of sharing the distress even of those whose distress she thought of most s could affect her comparatively but little he was amazed and shocked but it could not her could not dwell on her mind she was obliged to call herself to think of it and acknowledge it to be terrible and grievous or it was escaping her in the midst of all the pressing joyful cares attending this summons to herself there is nothing like employment active indispensable employment for sorrow employment even melancholy may melancholy and her occupations were hopeful she had so much to do that not even the horrible story of mrs now fixed to the last point of certainty could affect her as it had 
65,done before she had not time to be miserable within twenty four hours she was hoping to be gone her father and mother must park s be spoken to prepared every thing got ready business followed business the day was hardly long enough the happiness she was too happiness very little by the black communication whidi must briefly it â the joyful consent of her father and mother to s going with her â the general satisfaction with which the going of both seemed regarded â and the ecstasy of herself was all serving to support her spirits the affliction of the was little felt in the family mrs price talked of her poor sister for a few minutes but how to find any thing to hold s clothes because took away all the boxes and spoilt them was much more in her thoughts and as for now unexpectedly gratified in the first wish of her heart and knowing nothing personally of those who had or of those who were â if she could help rejoicing from beginning to end it was as much as ought to be expected from human virtue at fourteen as nothing was really left for the decision of mrs price or the good offices of every thing was and duly accomplished and the girls were ready for the morrow the advantage of much sleep to prepare them for their journey was impossible the cousin who was travelling towards them could hardly have less than visited their agitated spirits one all happiness the other all varying and indescribable by eight in the morning was in the house the girls heard his entrance from above and went down the idea of immediately seeing him with the knowledge of what he must be brought back all her own first feelings he so near her and in misery she was ready to sink as she entered the parlour he was alone and met her instantly and she found herself pressed to his heart with only these words just articulate my â my only sister â my only comfort now she could say nothing nor for some minutes he say more he turned away to recover himself and when he spoke again though his voice still faltered his manner showed the wish of self command and the of any farther have yon when you be ready does go â were questions following each other rapidly his great object was to be off as soon as possible when was considered time was and the state of his own mind made him find relief only in motion it was settled he should order the carriage to the door in half an answered for their having and being quite ready in half an hour he had already ate and de staying for their meal he would walk round the and join them with the carriage he was gone again glad to get away even from he looked very ill evidently under violent emotions which he was determined to suppress she knew it must be so but it was terrible to her the carriage came and he entered the house again at the same moment just in time to spend a few minutes with the family and be a witness â but that he saw nothing â of the tranquil manner in which the daughters were parted with and just in time to prevent their sitting down to the breakfast table which by dint of much unusual activity was quite and completely ready as the carriage drove from the door s last meal in her father s house was in character with her first she was dismissed from it as as she had been welcomed how her heart swelled with joy and gratitude as she passed the of and how s face wore its smiles may be easily conceived sitting forwards however and by her bonnet those smiles were unseen the journey was likely to be a silent one s deep sighs often reached had he been alone with her his heart must have opened in spite of every resolution but s presence drove him quite into himself and his attempts to talk on indifferent subjects could never be long supported watched him with never failing solicitude and sometimes catching his eye revived an affectionate park her but the first day s passed without her hearing a word from him on the thai were weighing him down the next morning produced a little more just before their setting out from while was stationed at a window in eager observation of the departure of a large family from the inn the other two were standing by the fire and particularly struck by the alteration in s looks and from his ignorance of the daily evils of her father s house an undue share of the change all to the recent event took her hand and said in a low but very expressive tone no wonder â you must feel it â you must suffer how a man who had once loved could desert you but yours â your regard was new compared with â of me the first division of their journey occupied a long day and brought them almost knocked up to oxford but the second was over at a much earlier hour they were in the of long before the usual and as they approached the beloved place the hearts of both sisters sank a little began to dread the with her and tom under so dreadful a and to feel with some anxiety that all best manners all her lately acquired knowledge of what was practised here was on the point of being called into action visions of good and ill breeding of old and new were before her and she was meditating much upon silver forks and finger glasses had been every where awake to the difference of the country since february but when they entered the park her and her 
66,pleasures were of the keenest sort it was three months full three months since her it and the change was from winter to summer her eye fell every where on and of the green and the trees though not fully clothed were in that delightful state when farther beauty is known to be at hand and when while much is actually given to the sight more yet re for the imagination her enjoyment however was for herself alone could not i are it she park looked at him but he was leaning back sunk in a deeper gloom than ever and with eyes closed as if the view of cheerfulness oppressed him and the lovely scenes of home must be shut out it made her melancholy again and the knowledge of what must be enduring there invested even the house modern airy and well situated as it was with a aspect by one of the suffering party within they were expected with such impatience as she had never known before had scarcely passed the solemn looking servants when lady came from the to meet her came with no indolent step and falling on her neck said dear now i shall be comfortable chapter xvi it had been a miserable party each of the three believing themselves most miserable mrs however as most attached to maria was really the greatest sufferer maria was her first favourite the dearest of all the match had been her own as she had been wont with such pride of heart to feel and say and this con of it almost overpowered her she was an altered creature indifferent to every thing that passed the being left with hei sister and nephew and all the house under her care had been an advantage entirely thrown away she had been unable to direct or dictate or even fancy herself useful when really touched by affliction her active powers had been all and neither lady nor tom had received from her the smallest support or attempt at support she had done no more for them than they had done for each other they had been all solitary helpless and forlorn alike and now the arrival of the others only established her superiority in wretchedness her com park were relieved but there was no good for her â was almost as welcome to his brother as to her aunt but mrs instead of having comfort from either was but the more irritated by the sight of the person whom in the blindness of her anger she could have charged as the demon of the piece had accepted this could not have happened too was a grievance she had not spirits to notice her in more than a few repulsive looks but she felt her as a spy and an intruder and an niece and every thing most odious by her other aunt was received with quiet kindness lady could not give her much time or many words but she felt her as s sister to have a claim at and was ready to kiss and like her and was more than satisfied for she came perfectly aware that nothing but ill humour was to be expected om aunt and was so provided with happiness so strong in that best of blessings an escape from many certain evils that she could have stood against a great deal more than she met with from the others she was now left a good deal to herself to get acquainted with the house and grounds as she could and spent her days very happily in so doing while those who might otherwise have attended to her were shut up or wholly occupied each with the person quite dependent on them at this time for every thing like comfort trying to bury his own feelings in exertions for the relief of his brother s and devoted to her aunt returning to every former office with more than former zeal and thinking she could never do enough for one who seemed so much to want her to talk over the dreadful business with talk and lament was all lady s consolation to be listened to and borne with and hear the voice of and sympathy in return was every thing that could be done for her to be otherwise comforted was out of the question the case admitted of no comfort lady did not think deeply but guided by sir thomas she thought justly on all important points v â d d therefore in all its what had happened and neither endeavoured herself nor required to advise her to think little of guilt and her affections were not acute nor was her mind after a time found it not impossible to direct her thoughts to other subjects and revive some interest in the usual occupation but whenever lady was fixed on the event she could see it only in one light as the loss of a daughter and a disgrace never to be wiped off learnt from her all the particulars which had yet her aunt was no very but with the help of some letters to and from sir thomas and what she already knew herself and could reasonably combine she was soon able to understand quite as much as she wished of the circumstances attending the story mrs had gone for the holidays to with a family whom she had just grown intimate with â a family of lively agreeable manners and probably of morals and discretion to suit â for to their house mr had constant access at all times his having been in the same neighbourhood already knew mr had been gone at this time to bath to pass a few days with his mother and bring her back to town and maria was with these friends without any restraint without even for had removed from street two or three weeks before on a visit to some relations of sir thomas 
66,a removal which her father and mother were now disposed to attribute to some view of convenience on mr s account very soon after the return to street sir thomas had received a letter from an old and most particular friend in london who hearing and witnessing a good deal to alarm him in that quarter wrote to recommend sir thomas s coming to london himself and using his influence with his daughter to put an end to an intimacy which was already exposing her to unpleasant remarks and evidently making mr uneasy sir thomas waa i ie ta ai u this letter with at communicating its contents to any creature at when it was followed by another sent express â rom the same friend to break to him the almost desperate situation in which affairs then stood with the young people mrs rush worth had left her husband s house mr had been in great anger and distress to him mr for his advice mr feared had been at least very the maid servant of mrs senior threatened he was doing all in his power to quiet every thing with the hope of mrs s return but was so much in street by the influence of mr s mother the worst consequences might be apprehended this dreadful communication could not be kept from the rest of the family sir thomas set off would go with him and the others had been left in a state of wretchedness inferior only to what followed the receipt of the next letters from london every thing was by that time public beyond a hope the servant of mrs the mother had exposure in her power and supported by her mistress was not to be silenced the two ladies even in the time they had been together had and the bitterness of the elder against her daughter in law might perhaps arise almost as much from the personal with which she had herself been treated as from sensibility for her son however that might be she was but had she been less obstinate or of less weight with her son who was always guided by the last speaker by the person who could get hold of and shut him up the case would still have been hopeless for mrs did not appear again and there was every reason to conclude her to be concealed somewhere with mr who had quitted his uncle s house as for a journey on the very day of her herself sir thomas however remained yet a little longer in town in the hope of discovering and her from farther vice though all was lost on the side of character his present state could hardly bear to think of park there was bat one of his children who was not at time a source of misery to him tom s complaints been greatly heightened by the shock of his sister s con and his recovery so much thrown back by it that even lady had been struck by the and all her were regularly sent off to her husband and s the additional blow which had met him on his arrival in london though its force had been at the moment must she knew be sorely felt she saw that it was his letters expressed how much he it under any circumstances it would have been an unwelcome alliance but to have it so formed and such a period chosen for its completion placed s feelings in a most light and severely a the folly of her choice he called it a bad thing done in the worst manner and at the worst time and though was yet as more than maria as folly than vice he could not but r ard the step she had taken as opening the worst of a conclusion hereafter like her sister s such was his opinion of the set into which she had thrown herself felt for him most he could have no comfort but in every other child must he his heart his displeasure against herself she trusted reasoning differently from mrs would now be done away she should be justified mr would have fully her conduct in refusing him but this though most material to herself would he poor consolation to sir thomas her uncle s displeasure was terrible

nature than what the others excited but ir thomas was considering his happiness as very deeply in in the offence of his sister and friend cut off by it as he must be from the woman whom he had been pursuing with attachment and strong probability success aud bo i x but this i it it s park would have been so eligible a connection he was aware of what must be suffering on his own behalf in addition to all the rest when they were in town he had seen or his feelings and having reason to think that me interview with miss had taken place from which â derived only increased distress bad been as anxious on that account as on others to get bim out of town and had engaged him in taking home to her aunt with a view to his relief and benefit no less than theirs was not in the secret of her uncle

that must be for ever divided from miss did not admit of a doubt with and yet till she knew that he felt the same her own conviction was insufficient she thought he did 
66,but she wanted to be assured of it if he would now speak to her with the which had sometimes been too much for her before it would be most but at she found was not to be she seldom saw him â never alone â he probably avoided being alone with her what was to be inferred that his judgment submitted to all his own peculiar and bitter share of this family affliction but that it was too keenly felt to be a subject of the slightest communication this must be his state he yielded but it was with agonies which did not admit of speech long long would it be ere miss s name passed his again or she could hope for a renewal of such con intercourse as had been it long they reached on thursday and it was not till sunday evening that began to talk to her on the subject sitting with her on sunday evening â a wet sunday evening â the very time of all â others when if a friend is at hand the heart must be opened and every thing â no one in the room except his mother who after hearing an affecting sermon bad cried to sleep â it was impossible not to speak a and with the usual hardly to be traced as to what came and the usual declaration if she would listen to him for a few minutes he should be very brief and certainly never tax her kindness in the same way again â she need not fear a repetition â it would be a subject entirely â he entered upon the luxury of relating circumstances and sensations of the first interest to himself to one of whose sympathy he was quite convinced how listened with what curiosity and concern what pain and what delight how the i of his voice was watched and how carefully her own eyes were fixed on any object but himself may be the opening was alarming he had seen miss he had been invited to see her he had received a note from lady to b him to call and r it as what was meant to be the last last interview of friendship and her with all the feelings of shame and wretchedness which s sister ought to have known he had gone to her in such a state of mind so softened so devoted as made it for a few moments im possible to s fears that it should be the last bat as he proceeded in his story these fears were over she had met him he said with a serious â certainly a â even an agitated air but before he had been able tâ speak one intelligible sentence she had introduced the subject in a manner which he owned had shocked him i heard you were in town said she â i wanted to see you let us talk over this sad business what equal the folly of our two relations â i could not answer but i believe my looks spoke she felt sometimes how quick to feel with a graver look and voice she then added â i do not mean to defend henry at your sister s expense so she b an â but how she went on is not fit â is hardly fit to be repeated to you i cannot recall all her words i would not upon them if i could their substance was great anger at the of each she her brothers folly in being drawn on by a woman whom he had never v cared for to do what must lose him the woman he adored park l ut still more the folly of poor maria in sacrificing such a situation plunging into such difficulties under the of bang really loved by a man who had long ago made his indifference clear guess what i must have felt to hear the woman whom no name than folly given so voluntarily so freely so coolly to it no reluctance no horror no feminine â shall i say no modest this is what the world does for where shall we find a woman whom nature had so richly endowed â spoilt spoilt after a little reflection he went on with a sort of desperate calmness â i will tell you every thing and then have done for ever she saw it only as folly and that folly stamped only by exposure the want of common discretion of caution â his going down to for the whole time of her being at â her putting herself in the power of a servant â it was the detection in short â oh it was the detection not the offence which she it was the which had brought things to extremity and obliged her brother to give up every dearer plan in order to with her he â â and what said believing herself required to speak what could you say nothing nothing to be understood i was like a man stunned she went on began to talk of you â yes then she began to talk of you as well she might the loss of such a there she spoke very but she has always done justice to you he has thrown said she such a woman as he will never see again she have fixed him she would have made him happy for ever â my dearest i am giving you i hope more pleasure than pain by this of what might have been â but what never can be now you do not wish me to be silent â if you do give me but a look a word and i have done no look or word was given thank god said he we were all disposed to â wonder â but it seems to have been the merciful appointment of providence that the heart which knew no 
66,â should not suffer she spoke of you with high praise an l d d i park warm affection yet even here there was a dash of evil for in the midst of it she could exclaim why would not she have him it is all her fault simple girl â i shall never forgive her had she accepted him as she ought they might now have heen on the point of marriage and henry would have heen too happy and too to want any other he would have taken no pains to be on terms with again it would have all ended in a regular standing in yearly meet at and â could you have he it possible but the charm is broken my eyes are opened cruel said â quite cruel at such a moment to give way to gaiety and to speak with lightness and to you absolute cruelty cruelty do you call it we differ there no hen is not a cruel nature i do not consider her as meaning to wound my feelings the evil lies yet deeper in her total ignorance of there being such feelings in a of mind which made it natural to her to treat the subject as she did she was speaking only as she had been used to hear others speak as she imagined every body else would speak hers are not faults of temper she would not voluntarily give unnecessary pain to any one and though i may deceive myself i cannot but think that for me for my feelings she would â hers are faults of principle of delicacy and a mind perhaps it is best for me â since it leaves me so little to regret not so however gladly would i submit to all the increased pain of losing her rather than have to think of her as i do i told her so did you yes when i left her i told her so how long were you together five and twenty minutes well she went on to say that what remained now to be done was to bring about a marriage between them she spoke of it with a voice than i can he was obliged to pause more than once as he continued we must persuade henry to marry her said she and what with honour and park lie certainty of having shut himself out for ver from f i do not despair of it he must give up i do not think that even he could now hope to succeed with one of her stamp and therefore i hope we may find no difficulty my influence which is not small shall all go that way and once married and properly supported by her own family people of as they are she may recover her footing in so to a certain degree in some circles we know she would never be admitted but with good dinners and large parties there will always be those who will be glad of her acquaintance and there is undoubtedly more liberality and on those points than formerly what i advise is that your father be quiet do not let him injure his own cause by interference persuade him to let things take their course if by any exertions of his she is induced to leave henry s protection there will be much less chance of his marrying her than if she remain with him i know how he is likely to be influenced let sir thomas trust to his honour and compassion and it may all end well but if he get his daughter away it will be destroying the chief hold after repeating this was so much affected that watching him with but most tender concern was almost sorry that the subject had been entered on at all it was long before he could speak at last now said he i shall soon have i have told you the substance of all that she said as soon as i could speak i replied that i had not supposed it possible coming in such a state of mind into that house as i had done that any thing could occur to make me fer more but that she had been deeper in almost every sentence that though i had in the course of our acquaintance been often sensible of some difference in our opinions on points too of some moment it had not entered my imagination to conceive the difference could be such as she had now proved it that the manner in which she treated the dreadful crime committed by her brother and my sister â with whom lay the greater i pretended not to say â but the manner in which she spoke t park of the crime itself it every reproach but thi right considering its ill consequences only as they were to be or by a defiance of decency and in wrong and last of all and above all to us a compliance a compromise an acquiescence in e continuance of the sin on the chance of a marriage which thinking as i now thought of her brother sl rather be prevented than sought â all this together most convinced me that i had never understood her before and that as far as related to mind it had been the creature of my own imagination not miss that i had been too apt to dwell on for many months past that perhaps it was best for me i had less to regret in a friendship â feelings â hopes which must at any rate have been torn from me now and yet that i must and would confess that could i have restored her to what she had appeared to me before i would infinitely prefer any increase of the pain of parting for the sake of carrying with me the right of tenderness and esteem this is what i said â 
67,the purport of it â but as you may imagine not spoken so or as i have repeated it to you she was astonished exceedingly astonished more than astonished i saw her change countenance she turned extremely red i imagined i saw a mixture of many feelings â a great though short struggle â half a wish of yielding to truths half a sense of shame â but habit habit carried it she would have laughed if she could it was a sort of laugh as she answered a pretty good lecture upon my word was it part of your last sermon at this rate you will soon reform every body at and and when i hear of you next it may be as a celebrated preacher in some great society of or as a missionary into foreign parts she tried to speak carelessly but she was not so careless as she wanted to appear i only said in reply that from my heart i wished her well and earnestly hoped that she might soon learn to think more justly and not owe the most valuable knowledge we could any of us acquire â the knowledge of ourselves and of our duty â to the lessons of affliction â and left the room i had gone a few park i heard the door open behind me mr said she i looked back mr said she with a smile â but it was a smile ill suited to the conversation that had passed a playful smile seeming to invite in order to subdue me at least it appeared so to me i resisted it was the impulse of the moment to resist and still walked on i have since â sometimes â for a moment â r that i did not go back but i know i was right and such has been the end of our acquaintance and what an acquaintance has it been how have i been deceived in brother and sister deceived i thank you for your patience this ha been the greatest relief and now we will have done and such was s dependence on his words that for five minutes she thought they had done then however it all came on again or something very like it and nothing less than lady s rousing thoroughly up could really close such a conversation till that happened they continued to talk of miss alone and how she had attached him and how delightful nature had made her and how excellent she would have been had she fallen into good hands earlier now at liberty to speak openly felt more than justified in adding to his knowledge of her real character by some hint of what share his ther s state of health might be supposed to have in her wish for a complete reconciliation this was not an agreeable intimation nature resisted it for a while it would have been a vast deal pleasanter to have had her more in her attachment but his vanity was not of a strength to fight long against reason he submitted to be that tom s illness had influenced her only for himself this thought that considering the many of opposing habits she had certainly been more attached to him than could have been expected and for his sake been more near doing right thought exactly the same and they were also quite agreed in their opinion of the lasting effect the which such a disappointment must make on his m nd time would undoubtedly somewhat of his sufferings but still it was a sort of thing which he never could get en park the better of and as to his ever meeting with any woman who could â it was too impossible to be named but with indignation s friendship was all that he had to cling to chapter xvii let other pens dwell on guilt and misery i quit such odious subjects as soon as i can impatient to restore every body not greatly in fault themselves to tolerable comfort and to have done with all the rest my indeed at this very time i have the satisfaction of knowing must have been happy in spite of every thing she must have been a happy creature in spite of all that she felt or thought she felt for the distress of those around her she had sources of delight that must force their way she was returned to park she was useful she was beloved she was safe from mr and when sir thomas came back she had every proof that could be given in his then melancholy state of spirits of his perfect approbation and increased regard and happy as all must make her she would still have been happy without any of it for was no longer the of miss it is true that was very far from happy himself he was suffering from disappointment and regret over what was and wishing for what could never be she knew it was so and was sorry but it was with a sorrow so founded on satisfaction so tending to ease and so much in harmony with every dearest sensation that there are few who might not have been glad to exchange their greatest gaiety for it sir thomas poor sir thomas a parent and conscious of errors in his own conduct as a parent was the longest to suffer he felt that he ought not to have allowed the that his daughter s sentiments had been sufficiently known to him to render him in it that park in doing he had sacrificed the right to the expedient and heen governed hy motives of selfishness and wisdom these were reflections that required some time to soften but time will do almost every thing and though little comfort arose on mrs s side for the mi she had occasioned comfort was to he found greater than he had supposed in his 
67,other children s match became a less desperate business than he had considered it at first she was humble and wishing to be forgiven and mr desirous of being really received into the family was disposed to look up to him and he guided he was not very solid but there was a hope of his becoming less trifling â of his being at least tolerably domestic and quiet and at any rate there was comfort in finding his estate rather more and his debts much less than he had feared and in being consulted and treated as the friend best worth attending to there was comfort also in tom who gradually regained his health without the and selfishness of his previous habits he was the better for ever for his illness he had suffered and he had learnt to think two advantages that he had never known before and the self reproach arising from the deplorable event in street to which he felt himself by all the dangerous intimacy of his theatre made an impression on his mind which at the age of six and twenty with no want of sense or good companions was in its happy effects he became what he ought to be useful to his father steady and quiet and not living merely for himself here was comfort indeed and quite as soon as sir tho could place dependence on such sources of good â dâ round was to his father s ease by improvement in the only point in which he had given him pain before â improvement in his spirits after wandering about and sitting under trees with all the summer evenings he had so well talked his mind into submission as to be very tolerably cheerful again these were the circumstances and the hopes which brought their to sir thomas his sense of what was lost and in part v v park himself though the anguish arising from the conviction of his own errors in the education of his daughters was never to he entirely done away too late he aware how to the character of any young people must he the totally opposite treatment which maria and had heen always at home where the excessive indulgence and flattery of their aunt had heen continually contrasted with his own severity he saw how ill he had judged in expecting to what was wrong in mrs hy its reverse in himself clearly saw that he had hut increased the evil by teaching them to repress their spirits in his presence as to make their real disposition unknown to him and sending them for all their to a person who had been able to attach them only by the blindness of her affection and tbe excess of her praise here had heen grievous hut had as it was he gradually grew to feel that it had not been the most mistake in his plan of education something must have heen wanting within or time would have worn away much of its ill effect he feared that principle active principle had been wanting that they had never been properly taught to govern their inclinations and by that sense of duty which can alone suffice they had been instructed in their religion but never required to bring it into daily practice to be distinguished for elegance and accomplishments â the object of their youth â could have had no useful influence that way no moral effect on the mind he had meant them to be good but his cares had been directed to the understanding and manners not the disposition and of the necessity of self denial and humility he feared they had never heard from any lips that could profit them bitterly did he a deficiency which now he could scarcely comprehend to have been possible did he feel that with all the cost and care of an anxious and expensive education he had brought up his daughters without their understanding their first duties or his being acquainted with wi t park the high spirit and strong passions of mrs especially were made known to him only in their sad re suit she was not to he prevailed on to leave mr she hoped to marry him and they continued together till she was to be convinced that such hope was vain and till the disappointment and wretchedness arising from the conviction rendered her temper so had and her feelings for him so like hatred as to make them for a while each other s punishment and then induce a voluntary separation she had lived with him to he reproached as the ruin of all his happiness in and carried away no better consolation in leaving him than that she had divided them wliat can exceed the misery of such a mind in such a situation mr had no difficulty in a and so ended a marriage contracted under such circumstances as to make any better end the effect of good luck not to be reckoned on she had despised him and loved another â and he had been very much aware that it was the of stupidity and the disappointments of selfish passion can excite little pity his punishment followed his conduct as did a deeper punishment the deeper guilt of his wife he was released from the engagement to be and unhappy till so ne other pretty girl could attract him into matrimony again and he might set forward on a second and it is to be hoped more prosperous trial of the state â if to be at least with good humour and good luck while she must withdraw with infinitely stronger feelings to a retirement and reproach which could allow no second spring of hope or character where she could be placed became a subject of most melancholy and momentous consultation mrs whose attachment seemed to with the of her niece would have had her received at home and by them 
67,all sir thomas would not hear of it and mrs s anger was so much the greater from considering her residence there as the motive she persisted in placing his scruples to her account though park sir thomas very solemnly assured her that had heen no young woman in question had there been no person of either sex belonging to him to be b the society or hurt by the character of mrs he would never have offered so great an insult to thi neighbourhood as to expect it to notice her as i daughter â he hoped a penitent one â she should he protected by him and secured in every comfort and by every encouragement to do right which their situations admitted but farther than that he would go maria had destroyed her own character and h would not by a vain attempt to restore what never could be restored be affording his sanction to vice or in seeking to lessen its disgrace be to introducing such misery in another man s family as he had known himself it ended in mrs s to quit and devote herself to her unfortunate maria and in ao establishment being formed for them in another remote and private where shut up together with little society on one side no affection on the other no judgment it may be reasonably supposed that their became their mutual punishment mrs s removal from was the great comfort of sir thomas s life his opinion of her had been sinking from the day of his return from in every transaction together from that period in their daily intercourse in business or in chat she had been regularly losing ground in his esteem and convincing him that either time had done her much dis service or that he had considerably her sense and wonderfully borne with her manners before he had felt her as an evil which was so much the worse as there seemed no chance of its ceasing but with life she seemed a part of himself that must be borne for ever to be relieved from her therefore was great a felicity that had she not left bitter behind her there might have been danger of his learning almost to approve x i a good she was s x i never been able to w â ax â k if since mrs s her temper had he n in a state of such irritation as to make her every where tor not even had tears for aunt even when she was gone for ever that escaped better than maria was owing in some measure to a favourable difference of disposition and hut in a greater to her having been less the ling of that very aunt less flatter and less spoilt her beauty and had but a second place she had been always used to think herself a little inferior to maria her temper was naturally the easiest of the two her feelings though quick were more and education had not given her so very a degree of self consequence she had submitted tiie best to the disappointment in henry after the first bitterness of the don of being was over she had been tolerably soon in a fair way of not thinking of him again and when the was renewed in town and mr s house became s object she had had the merit of withdrawing herself from it and of choosing tliat time to pay a visit to her other friends in order to secure herself from being again too much attracted this had been her motive in going to her cousins mr s convenience had had nothing to do with it she had been allowing his attentions some time but with very little idea of ever accepting him and had not her sister s conduct burst forth as it did and her increased dread of her father and of home on that event â imagining its certain consequence to herself would be greater severity and restraint â made her hastily resolve on avoiding such immediate horrors at all risks it is probable that mr would never have succeeded she had not with any worse feelings those of selfish alarm it had appeared to her the only thing to be done maria s guilt had induced s henry ruined by early independence and bad domestic example indulged in the of a cold blooded vanity a little too long once it had â el o m k led him into th e v w vâ w â could he been satisfied conquest of one able s affections he hare found exultation in the in working him self into the esteem and tenderness of that would have been every probability of success and lor him his affection had already done something her influence over had already given him some ever her would he have deserved more there can be do doubt that more would have been obtained especially when that marriage had taken place which would have given bin the assistance of her conscience in her first and brought them very often together would he have and must have his reward â and a reward very voluntarily within a reasonable period from s marrying had he done as he intended and as he knew he ought q going down to after his return from he might have been deciding his own happy d tiny but he was pressed to stay for mrs r s party staying was made of flattering consequence and he was to meet mrs there curiosity and vanity both engaged and the of immediate was too strong for a mind unused to

95,his sisters for their fortune independent of what might arise to them from their father s that property could be but small their mother had nothing and their father only seven thousand pounds in his own disposal for the remaining of his first wife s fortune was also secured to her child and he had only a life interest in it the old gentleman died his will was read and like almost every other will gave as much disappointment as pleasure he was neither so unjust nor so ungrateful as to leave his estate from his nephew but he left it to him on such terms as destroyed half the value of the mr had wished for it more for the sake of his wife and daughters than for himself or his son but to his son and his son s son a child of four years old it was secured in such a way as to leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most dear to him and who most needed provision by any charge on the estate or by any sale of its valuable woods the whole was tied up for the benefit of this child who in occasional visits with his father and mother at had so far gained on the affections of his uncle by attractions as are by no means unusual in children of two or three years old â an imperfect an earnest desire of having his own way many cunning tricks and a great deal of noise â as to all the value of all the attention which for years he had received from his niece and her daughters he meant not to be however and as a mark of his affection for the three girls he left them a thousand pounds apiece mr s disappointment was at first severe but his temper was cheerful and sanguine and he might reasonably hope to live many years and by living lay by a considerable sum from the produce of an estate already large and capable of almost immediate improvement but the fortune which had been so in coming was his only one he survived his uncle no longer and ten thousand pounds including the late was all that remained for his widow and daughters his son was sent for as soon as his danger was known and to him mr recommended with all the and which could command the interest of his mother in law and sisters mr john had not the strong feelings of the rest of the family but he was affected by a recommendation of such a nature at such a time and he promised to do every thing in his power to make them comfortable his father was rendered easy by such an assurance and mr john had then leisure to consider how much there might be in his power to do for them he was not an ill disposed young man unless to be rather cold hearted and rather selfish is to be ill disposed but he was in general well respected for he conducted himself with propriety in the discharge of his ordinary duties had he married a more amiable woman he might have been made still more respectable than he was he might even have been made amiable himself for he was very young when he married and very fond of his wife but mrs john was a strong of himself more narrow minded and selfish when he gave his promise to his father he meditated within himself to increase the fortunes of his sisters by the present of a pounds apiece he then really thought himself equal to it the prospect of four thousand a year in addition to his present income besides the remaining half of his own mother s fortune warmed his heart and made him feel capable of generosity yes he would give them three thousand pounds it would be liberal and handsome it would be enough to make them completely easy three thousand pounds he could spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience he thought of it all day long and for many days and he did not repent no sooner was his father s funeral over than mrs john without sending any notice of her intention to her mother in law arrived with her child and their attendants no one could dispute her right to come the house was her husband s from the moment of his s but the of her conduct was so much the greater and to a woman in mrs s situation with only common feelings must have been highly but in her mind there was a sense of honor so keen a generosity so romantic that any offence of the kind by given or received and was to her a source of immovable disgust mrs john had never a favorite with any of her husband s family but she had had no opportunity till the present of showing them with how little attention to the comfort of other people she could act when occasion required it so did mrs feel this behavior and so earnestly did she despise her daughter in law for it that on the arrival of the latter she would have quitted the house for ever had not the entreaty of her eldest girl induced her first to reflect on the propriety of going and her own tender love for all her three children determined her afterwards to stay and for their avoid a breach with their brother this eldest daughter whose advice was so effectual possessed a strength of understanding and coolness of judgment which qualified her though only nineteen to be the of her mother and enabled her frequently to to the advantage of them all that eagerness of mind in mrs which must generally have led to she had an excellent heart â her disposition was affectionate and her feelings were strong but she knew 
95,how to govern them it was a knowledge which her mother had yet to learn and which one of her sisters had resolved to be taught s abilities were in many quite equal to s she was sensible and clever but eager in everything her sorrows her joys could have no moderation she was generous amiable interesting she was everything but prudent the resemblance between her and her was strikingly great saw with concern the excess of her sister s sensibility but by mrs it was valued and cherished they encouraged each other now in the violence of their the agony of grief which overpowered them at first was voluntarily renewed was sought for was created again and again they gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow seeking increase of wretchedness in reflection that could afford it and resolved against ever admitting consolation in future too was deeply afflicted but she could struggle she could exert herself she could consult with her brother could receive her sister in law on her and arrival and treat her with proper attention and could strive to rouse her mother to similar exertion and encourage her to similar forbearance margaret the other sister was a good girl but as she had already a good deal of s romance without having much of her sense she did not at thirteen bid fair to equal her sisters at a more advanced period of life chapter n mrs john now herself mistress of and her mother and sisters in law were degraded to the condition of visitors as such however they were treated by her with quiet civility and by her husband with as much kindness as he could feel towards anybody beyond himself his wife and their child he really pressed them with some earnestness to consider as their home and as no plan appeared so eligible to mrs as remaining there till she could accommodate herself with a house in the neighborhood his invitation was accepted a continuance in a place where everything reminded her of former delight was exactly what suited her mind in seasons of cheerfulness no temper could be more cheerful than hers or possess in a greater degree that sanguine expectation of happiness which is happiness itself but in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy and as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was beyond mrs john did not at all approve of what her husband intended to do for his sisters to take three thousand pounds from the fortune of their dear little boy would be him to the most dreadful degree she begged him to think again on the subject how could he answer it to himself to rob his child and his only child too of so large a sum and what possible claim could the who were related to him only by half blood which she considered as no relationship at all have on his generosity to so large an amount it was very well known that no affection was ever supposed to exist between and the children any man by different marriages and why was he to ruin himself and their poor little harry by giving away all his money to his half sisters it was my father s last request to me replied her husband that i should assist his widow and daughters he did not know what he was talking off i dare say ten to one but he was light headed at the time had he been in his right senses he could not have thought of such a thing as begging you to give away half your fortune from your own he did not for any particular sum my dear he only requested me in general terms to assist them and make their situation more comfortable than it was in his power to do perhaps it would have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself he could hardly suppose i should neglect them but as he required the promise i could not do less than give it at least i thought so at time the promise therefore was given and must be performed something must be done for them whenever they leave and settle in a new home well then let something be done for them but that something need not be three thousand pounds consider she added that when the money is once parted with it never can return your sisters will marry and it will be gone for ever if indeed it could ever be restored to our poor little boy why to be sure said her husband very gravely that would make great difference the time may come when harry regret that so large a sum was parted with if ho should have a numerous family for instance it would be a very convenient addition to be sure it would perhaps then it would be better for all parties if the sum were diminished one half five hundred pounds would be a prodigious increase to their fortunes oh beyond anything great what brother on earth would do half so much for his sisters even if his sisters and as it only half blood â but you have such a generous spirit i would not wish to do anything mean he replied had ther on such occasions do too much than too and h hide no one at least can i have done enough few them even themselves they câ n hardly expect more there is no knowing what they may expect said the lady hut we are not to think of their expectations the question is what you can afford to do certainly and i think i may afford to give them five hundred pounds apiece as it is without any addition of mine they will each have three thousand pounds on their mother s death â a very comfortable fortune for any young woman to be sure it is 
95,and indeed it strikes me that they can want no addition at all they will have ten thousand pounds divided amongst them if they marry they will be sure of doing well and if they do not they may all live very comfortably together on the interest of ten thousand pounds that is very true and therefore i do not know whether upon the whole it would not be more advisable to do something for their mother while she lives rather than for them â something of the kind i mean my sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself a hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable his wife hesitated a little however in giving her consent to this plan to be sure said she it is better than parting with fifteen hundred pounds at once but then if mrs should live fifteen years we shall be completely taken in fifteen years my dear her life cannot be worth half that purchase certainly not but if you observe people always live for ever when there is any to be paid them and she is very stout and healthy and hardly forty an is a very serious business it comes over and over every year and there is no getting rid of it you are not aware of what you are doing i have known a great deal of the trouble of for my mother was with the payment of three to old servants by my father s will and it is amazing how disagreeable she found it twice every year these were to be paid and then there was the trouble of getting it to them and then one of them was said to have died and afterwards it turned out to be no such thing my mother was quite sick of it her income was sense and sensibility not her o u she said with such perpetual claims on it and it was the more unkind in my father because otherwise the money would have been entirely at my mother s disposal without any whatever it has given me such an of that i am sure i would not pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world it is certainly an unpleasant thing replied mr to have those kind of yearly on one s income one s fortune as your mother justly says is not one s own to be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum on every rent day is by no means desirable it takes away one s independence undoubtedly and after all you have no thanks for it they think themselves secure you do no more than what is expected and it raises no gratitude at all if i were you whatever i did should be done at my own discretion entirely i would not bind myself to allow them anything yearly it may bo very inconvenient some years to spare a hundred or even fifty pounds from our own expenses i believe you are right my love it will be better that there should be no in the case whatever i may give them occasionally will be of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance because they would only their style of living if they felt sure of a larger income and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of the year it will certainly be much the best way a present of fifty pounds now and then will prevent their ever being distressed for money and will i think be amply my promise to my father to be sure it will indeed to say the truth i am convinced within myself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at all the assistance he thought of i dare say was only such as might be reasonably expected of you for instance such as looking out for a comfortable small house for them helping them to move their things and sending them presents of fish and game and so forth whenever they are in season i ll lay my life that he meant nothing farther indeed it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did do but consider my dear mr how excessively comfortable your mother in law and her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand and pounds besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls which brings them in fifty pounds a year apiece and of course they will pay their mother for their board out of it altogether they will have five hundred a year amongst them and what on earth can four women want for more than that â they will live so cheap their house keeping will be nothing at all they will have no carriage no horses and hardly any servants they will keep no company aud can have no expenses of any kind only conceive how comfortable they will be five hundred a year i am sure i cannot imagine how they will spend half of it and as to your giving them more it is quite absurd to of it they will be much more able to give you something upon my word said mr i believe you are perfectly right my father certainly could mean nothing more by his request to me than what you say i clearly understand it now and i will strictly fulfil my engagement by such acts of assistance and kindness to them as you have described when my mother into another house my services shall be readily given to accommodate her as far as i can some little present of furniture too may be acceptable then certainly returned mrs john dash wood but however one thing must be considered when your father and mother moved to though the furniture of was sold all the china plate and linen was saved and is now 
96,left to your mother her house will therefore be almost completely fitted up as soon as she takes it that is a material consideration undoubtedly a valuable indeed and yet some of the plate would have been a very pleasant addition to our own stock here yes and the set of breakfast china is twice as handsome as what belongs to this house a great deal too handsome in my opinion for any place they can ever afford to live in but however so it is your father thought only of them and i must say this that you owe no particular gratitude to him nor attention to his wishes for we very well know that if he could he would have left almost everything in the world to this argument was irresistible it gave to his intentions whatever of decision was wanting before and he finally sense and resolved that it would be absolutely unnecessary if not highly to do more for the widow and children his father than such kind of acts as his own wife pointed out chapter lu mrs remained at several months not from any to move when the sight of every well known spot ceased to raise the violent emotion which it produced for a while for when her spirits began to revive and her mind became capable of some other exertion than that of its affliction by melancholy she was impatient to be gone and in her for a suitable dwelling in the neighborhood of for to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible but she could hear of no situation that at once answered her notions of comfort and ease and suited the prudence of her eldest daughter whose judgment rejected several houses as too large for their income which her mother would have mrs had by her husband of the solemn promise on the part of his son in their favor which gave comfort to his last earthly reflections she doubted the sincerity of this assurance no more than he had doubted it himself and she thought of it for her daughters sake with satisfaction though as for herself she was persuaded that a much smaller provision than would support her in for their brother s sake too for the sake of his own heart she rejoiced and she reproached herself for being unjust to his merit before in believing him incapable of generosity his attentive behaviour to herself and his sisters convinced her that their welfare was dear to him and for a long time she firmly relied on the liberality of his intentions the contempt which she had very early in their acquaintance felt for her daughter in law was very much increased by the farther knowledge of her character which half a year s residence in her family afforded and perhaps in spite em s and ft of every consideration of politeness or maternal affection on the side of the former the two ladies might hare found it impossible to have lived together so long had not a particular circumstance occurred to give still greater according to the opinions of mrs to her daughters continuance at this circumstance was a growing attachment between her eldest girl and the brother of mrs john a and pleasing young man who was introduced to their acquaintance soon after his sister s establishment at and who had since spent the greatest part of his time there some mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from motives of interest for edward was the eldest son of a man who had died very rich and some might have repressed it from motives of prudence for except a trifling sum the whole of his fortune depended on the will of his mother but mrs was alike by either consideration it was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable that he loved her daughter and that returned the partiality it was contrary to every doctrine of hers that of fortune should keep any couple asunder who were attracted by resemblance of disposition and that minor s merit should not be acknowledged by every one who knew her was to her comprehension impossible edward was non recommended to their good opinion by any peculiar graces of person or address he was not handsome and manners required intimacy to make them pleasing he was too to do justice to himself but when his natural shyness was overcome his behaviour gave every indication of an open affectionate heart his understanding was good and his education had given it solid improvement but he was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition to answer the wishes of his mother and sister who longed to see him distinguished â as â they hardly knew what they wanted him to make a fine figure in the world in some manner or other his mother wished to interest him in political concerns to get him into ment or to see him connected with some of the great men of the day mrs john wished it likewise but in the mean while till one of these superior blessings could bo and attained it would have her to see driving a but edward had no turn for great men or all his wishes in domestic comfort and the quiet of private life fortunately he had a younger brother who was more promising edward had been staying several weeks in the house before he engaged much of mrs s attention for she was at that time in such affliction as rendered her careless of surrounding objects she saw only that he was quiet and and she liked him for it he did not disturb the wretchedness of her mind by ill timed conversation she was first called to observe and approve him farther by a reflection which chanced one day to make on the difference between him and his sister it was a contrast which recommended him most forcibly to her mother it is enough said 
96,she to say that he is unlike is enough it everything amiable i love him already i think you will like him said when you know more of him like him replied her mother with a smile i can feel no sentiment of approbation inferior to love you may esteem him i have never yet known what it was to separate esteem and love mrs now took pains to get acquainted with him her manners and soon banished his reserve she speedily comprehended all his merits the persuasion of his regard for perhaps assisted her penetration but she really felt assured of his worth and even that of manner which against all her established ideas of what a young man s address ought to be was no longer uninteresting when she knew his heart to be warm and his temper affectionate no sooner did she perceive any symptom of love in his behaviour to than she considered their serious attachment as certain and looked forward to their marriage as rapidly approaching in a few months my dear said she will in all probability be settled for life we shall miss her but will be happy e and â oh mamma how shall we do without her my love it will be scarcely a separation we shall live within a few miles of each other and shall meet every day of our lives you will gain a brother a real affectionate brother i have the highest opinion in the world of edward s heart but you look grave do you your sister s choice f perhaps said i may consider it with some surprise edward ia very amiable and i love him tenderly but yet â he is not the kind of young man â there is something wanting â his figure is not striking it has none of that grace which i should expect in the man who could seriously attach my sister his eyes want all that spirit that fire which at once announce virtue and intelligence and besides all this i am afraid mamma he has no real taste music seems scarcely to attract him and though he s drawings very much it is not the admiration of a person who can understand their worth it is evident in spite of his frequent attention to her while she draws that in fact he knows nothing of the matter he as a lover not as a to satisfy me those characters must be united i could not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every point with my own he must enter into all my feelings the same books the same music must charm us both oh mamma how how tame was edward s manner in reading to us last night i felt for my sister most severely yet she bore it with so much composure she seemed scarcely to notice it t could hardly keep my seat to hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost driven me wild pronounced with such impenetrable calmness such dreadful indifference he would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant prose i thought so at the time but you would i give him nay mamma if he is not to be animated by â but we must allow for difference of taste has not my feelings and therefore she may overlook it and be happy with him but it would have broken my heart had i loved him to hear him read with so little sensibility mamma the more i know of the world the more am i convinced that i shall never see a man whom i can really love i require and much he must have all edward s virtues and his person and manners must ornament his goodness with every possible charm my love that you are not seventeen it is yet too early in life to despair of such a happiness why should you be less fortunate than your mother in one circumstance only my may your destiny be from hers i chapter iv what a pity it is said that edward should have no taste for drawing no taste for drawing replied why should you think so he does draw himself indeed but he has great pleasure in seeing the performances of other people and i assure you he is by no means deficient in natural taste though he has not had opportunities of improving it had he ever been ii the way of learning i think he would have drawn very well he his own judgment in such matters so much that he is always unwilling to give his opinion on any picture but he has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste which in general direct him perfectly right was afraid of offending and said no more on the subject but the kind of approbation which described as excited in him by the drawings of other people was very far from that delight which in her opinion could alone be called taste yet though smiling within herself at the mistake she honored her sister for that blind partiality to edward which produced it i hope continued you do not consider him as deficient in general taste indeed i think i may say that you cannot for your behaviour to him is perfectly cordial and if that were your opinion i am sure you could never be civil to him hardly knew what to say she would not wound the feelings of her sister on any account and yet to say what she did not believe was impossible at length she replied â b and do not be offended if my of him is not in everything equal to your sense of his merits i have not had so many opportunities of the of his mind his inclinations and tastes as you have but i have the highest opinion in the world of his goodness and sense i think him everything 
96,that is worthy and amiable i am sure replied with a smile that his dearest friends could not be dissatisfied with such that i do not perceive how you could express yourself more warmly was rejoiced to find her sister so easily pleased of his sense and his goodness continued no one can i think be in doubt who has seen him often enough to engage him in conversation the excellence of his understanding and his principles can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps him silent you know enough of him to do justice to his solid worth but of his as you call them you have from peculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself he and i have been at times thrown a good deal together while you have been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother i have seen a great deal of him have studied his sentiments and heard his opinion on subjects of literature and taste and upon the whole i venture to pronounce that his mind is well informed his enjoyment of books exceedingly great his imagination lively his observation just and correct and his taste delicate and pure his abilities in every respect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person at first sight his address is certainly not striking and his person can hardly be called handsome till the sion of his eyes which are uncommonly good and the general sweetness of his countenance is perceived at present i know him so well that i think him really handsome or at least almost so what say you i shall very soon think him if i do not now when you tell me to love him as a brother i shall no more see in his face than i now do in his heart started at this declaration and was sorry for the warmth she had been betrayed into in speaking of him she felt that edward stood very high in her opinion she believed the regard to be mutual but she required greater certainty k and of it to make s conviction of their agreeable to her she knew that what and hei mother one moment they believed tiie next â that with them to wish was to hope and to hope was to expect she tried to explain the real state of the case to hei sister i do not attempt to deny said she that i think very highly of him â that i greatly esteem that i like him here burst forth with â esteem him like him cold hearted oh worse than cold hearted ashamed of being otherwise use those words again and i will leave the room this moment could not help laughing excuse me said she and be assured that i meant no to you by speaking in so quiet a way of my own feelings believe them to be stronger than i have declared believe them in short to be such as his merit and the suspicion â the hope of his affection for me may warrant without or folly but farther than this you must not believe i am by no means assured of his regard for me there are moments when the extent of it seems doubtful and till his sentiments are fully known you cannot wonder at my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality by believing or calling it more than it is in my heart i feel little â scarcely any doubt of his preference but there are other points to be considered besides his inclination he is very far from being independent what his mother really is we cannot know but from s occasional mention of her conduct and opinions we have never been disposed to think her amiable and i am very touch mistaken if edward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in his way if he were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a great fortune or high rank was astonished to f nd how much the imagination of her mother and herself had the truth and you really are not engaged to him said she yet it certainly soon will happen but two advantages will proceed from this delay shall not lose you so soon and edward will have greater opportunity of improving that natural taste for your favorite pursuit which must be so necessary to your fu felicity oh if he and be bo r stimulated bj your as to learn to draw how delightful it would be p had given her real opinion to her sister she not consider her partiality for edward in so prosperous a state as had believed it there was at times a want spirits about him which if it did not indifference spoke a something almost as a doubt of her r ard su him to feel it need not give him more than it would not be likely to produce that of mind which frequently attended a more reasonable cause might be found in the dependent situation which the indulgence of his affection she knew that his mother neither behaved to him so as to make his home comfortable at present nor to give him any assurance at he might form a home lor himself without attending to her views for his with such a knowledge as this it was impossible for to feel easy on the subject she was fat from depending on that result of his preference of her whidi her mother and sister still considered as certain li ay the longer they were together the more doubtful seemed the nature of his regard and sometimes for a few painful minutes she believed it to be no more than friendship but whatever might really be its limits it was enough when perceived by his sister to make her uneasy and at the same time which was still 
96,more common to make her she took the first opportunity of her mother n law on the occasion talking to her so of her brother s great expectations of mrs s resolution that both her sons should marry well and of the danger attending any young woman who attempted to am tn that mrs could neither pretend to be unconscious nor endeavor to be calm she gave her an answer which marked her contempt and left the room that whatever might be the inconvenience or expense of so sudden a removal her beloved should not be exposed another week to such in thâ state of her spirit a letter was delivered to her from the post which contained a proposal particularly well timed it was the offer of a small house on very easy terms belonging to a relation of her own a gentleman of con sense and sensibility and property in the letter was from this gentleman himself and written in the true spirit of friendly accommodation he understood that she was in need of a dwelling and though the house he now offered her was merely a cottage he her that everything should be done to it which she might think necessary if the situation pleased her he earnestly pressed her after giving the particulars of the house and garden to come with her daughters to park the place of his own residence from whence she might judge herself whether cottage for the houses were in the same parish could by any alteration be made comfortable to her he seemed really anxious to accommodate them and the whole of his letter was written in so friendly a style as could not fail of giving pleasure to his cousin more especially at a moment when she was suffering under the cold and behaviour of her nearer connections she needed no time for deliberation or inquiry her resolution was formed as she read the situation of in a county so far distant from as which but a few hours before would have been a objection to every possible advantage belonging to the place was now its first recommendation to quit the neighbourhood of was no longer an evil it was an object of desire it was a blessing in comparison of the misery of continuing her daughter in law s guest and to remove for ever from that beloved place would be less painful than to or visit it while such a woman was its mistress she instantly wrote sir john her acknowledgment of his kindness and her acceptance of his proposal and then hastened to show both letters to her daughters that she might be secure of their approbation before her answer were sent had always thought it would be more prudent for them to settle at some distance from than immediately amongst their present acquaintance on that head therefore it was not for her to oppose her mother s intention of removing into the house too as described by sir john was on so simple a scale and the re t so uncommonly moderate as to leave her no right of objection on either point and therefore though it was a removal from the vicinity of beyond her wishes she made no e and sâ s attempt to her mother from sending a letter of acquiescence v no sooner was her answer than mrs indulged herself in the pleasure of announcing to her son and his wife that she was provided with a house and should them no longer than till everything were ready for her it they heard her with surprise mrs john said nothing but her husband hoped that she would not be settled far from she had great satisfaction in replying that she was going into edward turned hastily towards her on g this and in a voice of surprise and concern which required no explanation to her repeated are you indeed going there so far from hence and to what part of it she explained the situation it was within four miles northward of it is but a cottage she continued but i hope to see many of my friends in it a room or two can easily be added and if my friends find no difficulty in travelling so far to see me i am sure i will find none in them she concluded with a very kind invitation to mr and mrs john to visit her at and to she gave one with still greater though her late conversation with her daughter in law had made her resolve on remaining at no longer than was it had not produced the smallest effect on her in that point to which it principally tended to separate edward and was as far from being her object as ever and she wished to show mrs john by this pointed invitation to her brother how totally she disregarded her of the match mr john told his mother again and again how exceedingly sorry he was that she had taken a house at such a distance from as to prevent his being of any service to her in removing her furniture he really felt and vexed on the occasion for the very exertion to which he had limited the performance of his promise to his father was by this arrangement rendered the furniture was all sent around by water it chiefly consisted of household linen plate china and books with a handsome piano of s mr john saw the depart with a sigh could not help feeling it hard that as mrs s income would be so trifling in comparison with their own she should have any handsome article of furniture mrs took the house for a it was ready furnished and she might have immediate possession no difficulty arose on either side in the agreement and she waited only for the disposal of her effects at and to determine her future household before she set off for 
97,the west and this as she was exceedingly rapid in the performance of everything that interested her was soon done the horses which were left her by her husband had been sold soon after his death and an opportunity now offering of of her carriage she agreed to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her eldest daughter for the comfort of her children had she consulted only her own wishes she would have kept it but the discretion of prevailed her wisdom too limited the number of their servants to three two maids and a man with whom they were speedily provided from amongst those who had formed their establishment at the man and one of the maids ere sent off immediately into to prepare the house for their mistress s arrival for as lady was entirely unknown to mrs she preferred going directly to the cottage tp being a visitor at park and she relied so on sir john s description of the house as to feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she entered it as her own her eagerness to be gone from was preserved from by the evident satisfaction of her daughter in law in the prospect of her removal a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealed under a cold invitation to her to her departure now was the time when her bon in law s promise to his father might with particular propriety be fulfilled since he had neglected to do it on first sense and coming to the estate their his house might be looked on as the most suitable period for its accomplishment but mrs began shortly to give over every hope of the kind and to be convinced from the general drift of his discourse that his assistance extended no farther than their maintenance for six months at he so frequently talked of the increasing expenses of housekeeping and of the perpetual demands upon his purse which a man of any consequence in the world was beyond calculation exposed to that he seemed rather to stand in need of more money himself than to have any design of giving money away in a very few weeks from the day which brought sir john s first letter to everything was so far settled in their future abode as to enable mrs and her daughters to begin their journey many were the tears shed by them in their last to a place so much beloved dear dear i said as she wandered alone before the house on the last evening of their being there when shall i cease to regret you â when learn to feel a home elsewhere â oh happy house could you know what i suffer in now you from this spot from whence perhaps i may view you no more â and you ye well known trees â but you will continue the same no leaf will decay because we are removed nor any branch become motionless although we can observe you no longer â no you will continue the same unconscious of the pleasure or the regret you occasion and insensible of any change in those who walk under your shade â but who will remain to enjoy you chapter vi the first part of their journey was performed in too melancholy a disposition to be otherwise than tedious and unpleasant but as they drew towards the end of it their interest in the appearance of a country which they were to overcame their and a view of valley as they entered it gave them cheerfulness it was a pleasant fertile spot well wooded and rich in pasture after winding and sensibility along it for more than a mile they reached their own house a small green court was the whole of its in front and a neat gate admitted them into it as a house cottage though small was comfortable and compact but as a cottage it was for the building was regular the roof was the window shutters were not painted green nor were the walls covered with a narrow passage led directly through the house into the garden behind on each side of the entrance was a sitting room about sixteen feet square and beyond them were the offices and the stairs four bed rooms and two formed the rest of the house it had not been built many years and was in good repair in comparison of it was poor and small indeed â but the tears which recollection called forth as they entered the house were soon dried away they were cheered by the joy of the servants on their arrival and each for the sake of the resolved to appear happy it was very early in september the season was fine and from first seeing the place under the advantage of good weather they received an impression in its favor which was of material service in it to their lasting approbation the situation of the house was good high hills rose immediately behind and at no great distance on each side some of which were open downs the others cultivated and the village of was chiefly on one of these hills and formed a pleasant view from the cottage windows the prospect in front was more extensive it commanded the whole of the valley and reached into the country beyond the hills which surrounded the cottage terminated the valley in that direction under another name and in another course it out again between two of the of them with the size and furniture of the house mrs dash wood was upon the whole well satisfied for though her former style of life rendered many additions to the latter indispensable yet to add and improve was a delight to her and she had at this time ready money enough to supply all that was wanted of greater elegance to the apartments as for the house itself to be 
97,sure said she it is too small for our family but we will make ourselves tolerably comfortable for e and tke present as it is too late in the year for improvements perhaps in the spring if i have plenty of money as i dare say i we may think about building these are both too small for such parties of our friends as i hope to see often collected here and i hare some thoughts of throwing the passage into one of them with perhaps a part of the other and so leave the remainder of that other for an entrance this with a new drawing room which may be easily added and a bed chamber and garret above will make it a very sung little cottage i could wish the stairs were handsome but one must not expect everything though i suppose it would be no difficult matter to them i shall see how much i am before hand with the world in the spring and we will plan our improvements accordingly in the meantime till all these alterations could be made from the of an income of ve hundred a year by a woman who never saved in her life they were wise enough to be contented with the house as it was and each of them was busy in arranging their particular concerns and by placing around them their books and other possessions to form themselves a home s piano was and properly disposed of and s drawings were to the walls of their sitting room in such as these they were interrupted soon after breakfast the next day by the entrance of their landlord who called to welcome them to and to offer them every accommodation from his own house and garden in which theirs might at present be deficient sir john was a good looking man about forty he had formerly visited at but it was too long for his young cousins to remember him his countenance was thoroughly and his manners were as friendly as the style of his letter their arrival seemed to afford him real satisfaction and their comfort to be an object of real solicitude to him he said much of his earnest desire of their living in the most terms with his family and pressed them so cordially to dine at park every day till they were better settled at home that though his entreaties were carried to a point of perseverance beyond civility ihey could not give offence his kindness was not confined to words for within an hour after he left them a large basket full of garden stuff and fruit arrived from the park which was followed before sense sensibility the end of the day by a present of game he insisted moreover on conveying all their letters to and from the post for them and would not be denied the satisfaction of sending them his newspaper every day lady had sent a very civil message by him her intention of waiting on mrs as soon as she could be assured that her visit would be no inconvenience and as this message was answered by an invitation equally polite her was introduced to them the next day they were of course very anxious to see a person on whom so much of their comfort at must depend and the elegance of her appearance was favourable to their wishes lady was not more than six or seven and twenty her face was handsome her figure tall and striking and her address graceful her manners had all the elegance which her husband s wanted but they would have been improved by some share of his frankness and warmth and her visit was long enough to something from their first admiration by showing that though perfectly well bred she was reserved cold and had nothing to say for herself beyond the most common place inquiry or remark conversation however was not wanted for sir john was very and lady had taken the wise precaution of bringing with her their eldest child a fine little boy about six years old by which means there was one subject always to be to by the ladies in case of extremity for they had to his name and age admire his beauty and ask him questions which his mother answered for him while he hung about her and held down his head to the great surprise of her who wondered at his being so shy before company as he could make noise enough at home on every formal visit a child ought to be of the party by way of provision for discourse in the present case it took up ten minutes to determine whether the boy were most like his father or mother and in what particular he resembled either for of course every body differed and every body was astonished at the opinion of the others an opportunity was soon to be given to the of on the rest of the children as sir john would not leave the house without securing their promise of dining at the park the next chapter park was about half a mile from the cottage the ladies had passed near it in their way along the but it was from their view at home by the of a hill the house was large and handsome and the lived in a style of equal hospitality and elegance the former was for sir john s gratification the latter for that of his lady they were scarcely ever without some friends staying with them in the house and they kept more company of every kind than any other family in the neighbourhood it was necessary to the happiness of both for in temper and outward behaviour they strongly resembled each other in that total want of talent and taste which confined their with such as society produced within a very narrow compass sir john was a lady a 
97,mother he hunted and shot and she humoured her children and these were their only resources lady had the advantage of being able to spoil her children all the year round while sir john s independent were in existence only half the time continual engagements at home and abroad however supplied all the of nature and education supported the good spirits of sir john and gave exercise to the good breeding of his wife lady herself upon the elegance of her table and of all her domestic arrangements and from this kind of vanity was her greatest enjoyment in any of their parties but sir john s satisfaction in society was much more real he delighted in collecting about him more young people than his house would hold and the they were the better was he pleased he was a blessing to all the part of the neighbourhood for in summer he was for ever forming parties to eat cold ham and chicken out of doors and in winter his private balls were numerous enough for any young lady who was not suffering under the appetite of fifteen the arrival of a new family in the country was always a matter of joy to him and in every point of view he was charmed with the inhabitants he had now procured for his and cottage at dash wood were young pretty and unaffected it was enough to secure his good opinion for to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl could want to make her mind as as her person the friendliness of his disposition made him happy in those whose situation might be considered in comparison with the past as unfortunate in showing kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction of a good heart and in settling a family of females only in his cottage he had all the satisfaction of a for a though he only those of his sex who are likewise is not often desirous of encouraging their taste by admitting them to a residence within his own mrs and her daughters were met at the door of the house by sir john who welcomed them to park with unaffected sincerity and as he attended them to the drawing room repeated to the young ladies the concern which the same subject had drawn from him the day before at being unable to get any smart young men to meet them they would see he said only one gentleman there besides himself a particular friend who was staying at the park but who was neither very young nor very gay he hoped they would all excuse the of the party and could assure them it should never happen so again he had been to several families that morning in hopes of some addition to their number but it was moonlight and every body was full of engagements luckily lady s mother had arrived at within the last hour and as she was a very cheerful agreeable woman he hoped the young ladies would not find it so very dull as they might imagine the young ladies as well as their mother were perfectly satisfied with having two entire strangers of the party and wished for no more mrs lady s mother was a merry fat elderly woman who talked a great deal seemed very happy and rather vulgar she w is full of jokes and laughter and before dinner was over had said many witty things on the subject of lovers and husbands hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in and pretended to see them blush whether they did or not was vexed at it for her sister s sake and turned her b and sensibility eyes towards to see how she bore these attacks with an earnestness which gave far more pain than could arise from such common place as mrs s colonel the friend of sir john seemed no more adapted by resemblance of manner to be his friend than lady was to be his wife or mrs to be lady s mother he was silent and grave his appearance however was not in spite of his being in tho opinion of and margaret an absolute old bachelor for he was on the wrong side of five and thirty but though his face was not handsome his countenance was sensible and his address was particularly there was nothing in any of the party which could recommend them as companions to the dash woods but the cold of lady was so particularly repulsive that in comparison of it the gravity of colonel and even the boisterous mirth of sir john and his mother in law was interesting lady seemed to be roused to enjoyment only by the entrance of her four noisy children after dinner who pulled her about tore her clothes and put an end to every kind of discourse except what related to themselves in the evening as was discovered to be musical she was invited to play the instrument was unlocked every prepared to be charmed and who sang very well at their request went through the chief of the songs which lady had brought into the family on her marriage and which perhaps had lain ever since in the same position on the piano for her had celebrated that event by giving up music although by her mother s account she had played extremely well and by her own was very fond of it s performance was highly applauded sir john was loud in his admiration at the end of every and as loud in his conversation with the others while every song lasted lady frequently called him to order wondered how any one s attention could be diverted from music for a moment and asked to sing a particular song which had just finished colonel alone of all the party heard her without being in he paid her only the compliment of attention and 
97,she felt d s and sensibility a respect for him on the occasion which the others had reasonably by their want of taste his pleasure in music though it amounted not to that delight which alone could with her own was when contrasted against the horrible of the others and she was reasonable enough to allow that a man of five and thirty might well have all of feeling and every exquisite power of enjoyment she was perfectly disposed to make every allowance for the colonel s advanced state of life which humanity required chapter vm mrs was a widow with an ample she had only two daughters both of whom she had lived to see married and she had now therefore nothing to do but to marry all the rest of the world in the promotion of this object she was active as far as her ability reached and missed no opportunity of projecting among all the young people of her acquaintance she was remarkably quick in the discovery of and had enjoyed the advantage of raising the and the vanity of many a young lady by of her power over such a young man and this kind of enabled her soon after her arrival at to pronounce that colonel was very much in love with she rather suspected it to be so on the very first evening of their being together from his listening so attentively while she sang to them and when the visit was returned by the dining at the cottage the fact was ascertained by his listening to her again it must be so she was perfectly convinced of it it would be an excellent match for he was rich and she was handsome mrs had been anxious to see colonel well married ever since her connection with sir john first brought him to her knowledge and she was always anxious to get a good husband for every pretty girl the immediate advantage to hei self was by no means for it supplied her with endless jokes against s and d both at the park she laughed at the colonel and in the cottage at to the former her was probably as far as it regarded only himself perfectly indifferent but to the latter it was at first incomprehensible and when its object was understood she hardly knew whether most to laugh at its or censure its impertinence for she considered it as an reflection on the colonel s advanced years and on his forlorn condition as an old bachelor mrs who could not think a man five years younger than herself so ancient as he appeared to the youthful fancy of her daughter ventured to clear mrs from the probability of wishing to throw ridicule on his age but at least mamma you cannot deny the absurdity of the accusation though you may not think it colonel is certainly younger than mrs but he is old enough to be my father and if he were ever animated enough to be in love must have long every sensation of the kind it is too ridiculous when is a man to be safe from such wit if age and infirmity will not protect him infirmity said do you call colonel i can easily suppose that his age may appear much greater to you than to my mother but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his having the use of his limbs did not you hear him complain of the and is not that the commonest infirmity of declining life my dearest child said her mother laughing at this rate you must be in continual terror of my decay and it must seem to you a miracle that my life has been extended to the advanced age of forty mamma you are not doing me justice i know very well that colonel is not old enough to make hia friends yet apprehensive of losing him in the course of nature he may live twenty years longer but thirty five has nothing to do with matrimony perhaps said thirty five and seventeen had better not have any thing to do with matrimony together but if there by any chance happen to bo a woman who is single at seven and twenty i should not think colonel s being thirty five any objection to his marrying let and a woman of seven and twenty said after pausing a moment can never hope to feel or inspire affection again and if her home be uncomfortable or her fortune small i can suppose that she might bring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse for the sake of the provision and security of a wife in his marrying such a woman therefore there would be nothing it would be a compact of convenience and the world would be satisfied in my eyes it would be no marriage at all but that would be nothing to me it would seem only a commercial exchange in which each wished to be at the expense of the other it would be impossible i know replied to convince you that a woman of seven and twenty could feel for a man of thirty five anything near enough to love to make him a desirable companion to her but i must object to your colonel and his wife to the constant confinement of a sick chamber merely because he chanced to complain yesterday a very cold damp day of a slight feel in one of his shoulders but he talked of flannel said and with me a flannel waistcoat is invariably connected with and every species of that can the old and the feeble had he been only in a violent fever you would not have despised him half so much confess is not there something interesting to you in the flushed cheek hollow eye and quick pulse of a fever soon after this upon s leaving the room mamma said i have 
98,an alarm on the subject of illness which i cannot conceal from you i am sure edward is not well we have now been here almost a fortnight and yet he does not come nothing but real could occasion this extraordinary what else can detain him at had you any idea of his coming so soon said mrs dash wood had none on the contrary if i have felt any anxiety at all on the subject it has been in that he sometimes showed a want of pleasure and in accepting my invitation when i talked of his coming to does expect him already i have never mentioned it to her but of course she must and i rather think you are mistaken for when i was talking to her yesterday of getting a new grate for the spare bed chamber she observed that there was no immediate hurry for it as it was not likely that the room would be wanted for some time how strange this is i what can be the meaning of it but the whole of their behaviour to each other has been unaccountable how cold how composed were their last how languid their conversation the last evening of their being together in edward s farewell there was no distinction between and me it was the good wishes of an affectionate brother to both twice did i leave them purposely together in the course of the last morning and each time did he most follow me out of the room and in and edward cried not as i did even now her self command is invariable when is she dejected or melancholy when does she try to avoid society or appear restless and dissatisfied in it p chapter ix the were now settled at with tolerable comfort to themselves the house and the garden with all the objects surrounding them were now become familiar and the ordinary pursuits which had given to half its charms were engaged in again with far greater enjoyment than had been able to afford since the loss of their father sir john who called on them every day for the first fortnight and who was not in the habit of seeing much occupation at home could not conceal his on finding them always employed their visitors except those from park were not many for in spite of sir john s urgent entreaties that they would mix more in the neighbourhood and repeated assurances of his carriage being always at their service the independence of mrs s spirit overcame the wish of society for her children and she was resolute in declining to visit any family beyond the distance of a walk there were but few who could be so and it was not all of them sense and that were about a mile and a tl cottage along the narrow winding valley of ham v issued from that of as formerly described the had in one of their earliest walks discovered an respectable looking mansion which by reminding them a little of interested their imagination and made them wish to be better acquainted with it but they learnt on that its possessor an elderly lady of very good character was unfortunately too to mix with the world and never stirred from home the whole country about them in beautiful walks the high downs which invited them from almost every window of the cottage to seek the exquisite enjoyment of air on their were a happy alternative when the dirt of the valleys beneath shut up their superior beauties and towards one of these hills did and margaret one memorable morning direct their steps attracted by the partial sunshine of a sky and unable longer to bear the confinement which the settled rain of the two preceding days had occasioned the weather was not tempting enough to draw the two others from their pencil and their book in spite of s declaration that the day would be fair and that every threatening cloud would be drawn off from their hills and the two girls set off together they gaily ascended the downs rejoicing in their own penetration at every glimpse of blue sky and when they caught in their faces the of a high wind they pitied the fears which had prevented their mother and from sharing such delightful sensations is there a felicity in the world said superior to this â margaret we will walk here at least two s margaret agreed and they pursued their way against the wind resisting it with laughing delight for about twenty minutes longer when suddenly the clouds united over their heads and a driving rain set full in their face and surprised they were obliged though unwillingly to turn back for no shelter was nearer than their own house one consolation however remained for them to which the of the moment gave more than usual propriety â it was that of running with all possible speed down the steep side of the hill which led immediately to their garden gate and they set off had at first the advantage bat a false step brought her suddenly to the ground and margaret unable to stop herself to assist her was involuntarily hurried along and reached the bottom in safety a gentleman carrying a gun with two playing round him was passing up the hill and within a few yards of when her accident happened he put down his gun and ran to her assistance she had raised herself from the ground but her foot had been twisted in her fall and she was scarcely able to stand the gentleman offered his services and perceiving that her modesty declined what her situation rendered necessary took her up in his arms without farther delay and carried her down the hill then passing through the garden the gate of which had been left open by margaret he bore her directly into the house whither margaret was just 
98,arrived and quitted not his hold till he had seated her in a chair in the parlour and her mother rose up in amazement at their entrance and while the eyes of both were fixed on him with an evident wonder and a secret admiration which equally sprung from his appearance he for his intrusion by relating its cause in a manner so frank and so graceful that his person which was uncommonly handsome additional charms from his voice and expression had he been even old ugly and vulgar the gratitude and kindness of mrs would have been secured by an act of attention to her child but the influence of youth beauty and elegance gave an interest to the action which came home to her feelings she thanked him again and again and with a sweetness of address which always attended her invited him to be seated but this he declined as he was dirty and wet mrs then begged to know to whom she was obliged his name he replied was and his present home was at from whence he hoped she would allow him the honour of calling to morrow to after miss the honour was readily granted and he then departed to make himself still more interesting in the midst of a heavy rain his manly beauty and more than common were instantly the theme of general admiration and the sense and laugh his gallantry raised against received particular spirit from his exterior attractions herself had seen les of his person than the rest for the confusion which over her face on his lifting her up had robbed her of the power of regarding him after their entering the house but she had seen enough of him to join in all the admiration of the others and with an which always adorned her praise his person and air were equal to what her fancy had ever drawn for the hero of a favourite story and in his carrying her into the house with so little previous formality there was a rapidity of thought which particularly recommended the action to her every circumstance belonging to him was interesting his name was good his residence was in their favourite village and she soon found out that of all manly dresses a shooting jacket was the most becoming her imagination was busy her reflections were pleasant and the pain of a ankle was disregarded sir john called on them as soon as the next interval of fair weather that morning allowed him to get out of s and s accident being related to him he was eagerly asked whether he knew any gentleman of the name of at ham i cried sir john what is he in the country that is good news however i will ride over tomorrow and ask him to dinner on thursday you know him then said mrs dash wood know him to be sure i do why he is down here every year and what sort of a young man is he as good a kind of fellow as ever lived i assure you a very decent shot and there is not a bolder rider in england and is that all you can say for him cried indignantly but what are his manners on more intimate acquaintance what his pursuits his talents and genius sir john was rather puzzled upon my soul said he i do not know much about him as to all that but he is a pleasant good humoured fellow and has got the little black of a t ever saw was she out with him to day but could no more satisfy him as to the colour b and of mr s than be could describe to her the shades of his mind but who is he said where does he from has he a house at f on this point sir john could ve more certain intelligence and he told them that mr had no of his own in the country that he resided there only while he was visiting the old lady at ck to whom he was related and whose possessions he was to inherit adding yes yes he is very well worth catching i can tell you miss he has a pretty little estate of his own in besides and if i were you i would not him up to my younger in spite of all this tumbling down hills miss must not expect to have all the men to will be jealous it she does not take care i do not believe said mrs with a smile that mr will be by the attempts of either of my daughters towards what you call catching him it is not an employment to which they have been brought up men are very safe with us let them be ever so rich i am glad to find however from what you say that he is a respectable young man and one whose acquaintance will not be he is as good a sort of fellow i believe as ever lived repeated sir john i remember last christmas at a little hop at the park he danced from eight o clock till four without once sitting down did he indeed cried with sparkling eyes and with elegance with spirit yes and he was up again at eight to ride to covert that is what i like that is what a young man ought to be whatever be his pursuits his eagerness in them should know no moderation and leave him no sense of fatigue ay ay i see how it will be said sir john i see how it will be you will be setting your cap at him now and never think of poor that is an expression sir john said warmly which i particularly dislike i every common place phrase by which wit is intended and setting one s cap at a man or making a conquest are 
98,the most odious of all sensibility their is gross and and if their construction could ever be deemed clever time has long ago destroyed all its ingenuity sir john did not much understand this reproof but he laughed as heartily as if he did and then replied â ay you will make enough i dare say one way or other poor he is quite smitten already and he is very well worth setting your cap at i can tell you in spite of all this tumbling about and of ankles chapter x s as margaret with more elegance than precision called at the cottage early the next morning to make his personal he was received by mrs with more than politeness with a kindness which sir john s account of him and her own gratitude prompted and every thing that passed during the visit tended to assure him of the sense elegance mutual affection and domestic comfort of the family to whom accident had now introduced him of their personal charms he had not required a second interview to be convinced miss had a delicate complexion regular features and a remarkably pretty figure was still her form though not so correct as her sister s in having the advantage of height was more striking and her face was so lovely that when in the common cant of praise she was called a beautiful girl truth was less violently outraged than usually happens her skin was very brown but from its her complexion was uncommonly brilliant her features were all good her smile was sweet and attractive and in her eyes which were very dark there was a life a spirit an eagerness which could hardly be seen without delight from their expression was at first held back by the embarrassment which the remembrance of his assistance created but when this passed away when her spirits became collected when she saw that to the perfect good breeding of the gentleman he united frankness and vivacity and above all when she heard him declare that of sense and music and dancing he was passionately fond she gave him such a look of approbation as secured the largest share of his discourse to herself for the rest of his stay it was only necessary to mention any favourite amusement to engage her to talk she could not be silent when such points were introduced and she had neither shyness nor reserve in their discussion they speedily discovered that their enjoyment of dancing and music was mutual and that it arose from a general of judgment in all that related to either encouraged by this to a further examination of his opinions she proceeded to question him on the subject of books her favourite authors were brought forward and dwelt upon with so a delight that any young man of five and twenty must have been insensible indeed not to become an immediate convert to the excellence of such works however disregarded before their taste was strikingly alike the same books the same passages were by each or if any difference appeared any objection arose it lasted no longer than till the force of her arguments and the brightness of her eyes could be displayed he in all her caught all her enthusiasm and long before his visit concluded they conversed with the familiarity of a long established acquaintance well said as soon as he had left them â for one morning i think you have done pretty well you have already ascertained mr s opinion in almost every matter of importance you know what he thinks of and scott you are certain of his their beauties as he ought and you have received every assurance of his admiring pope no more than is proper but how is your acquaintance to be long supported under such extraordinary despatch of every subject for discourse you will soon have exhausted each favourite topic another meeting will suffice to explain his sentiments on picturesque beauty and second marriages and then you can have nothing farther to ask cried is this fair is this just are my ideas so scanty but i see what you mean i have been too much at my ease too happy too frank i have against every common place notion of decorum i have been open and sincere where t ought to have been reserved and sensibility dull and â had i talked only of the weather and the roads and had i spoken only once in ten minutes this reproach would have been spared my love said her mother you must not be offended with â she was only in jest i should her myself if she were capable of wishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new friend was softened in a moment on his side gave every proof of his pleasure in their acquaintance which an evident wish of improving it could offer he came to them every day to after was at first his excuse but the encouragement of his reception to which every day gave greater kindness made such an excuse unnecessary before it had ceased to be possible by s perfect recovery she was confined for some days to the house but never had confinement been less irksome was a young man of good abilities quick imagination lively spirits and open affectionate manners he was exactly formed to engage s heart for with all this he joined not only a person but a natural of mind which was now roused and increased by the example of her own and which recommended him to her affection beyond everything else his society became gradually her most exquisite enjoyment they read they talked they sang together his musical talents were considerable and he read with all the sensibility and spirit which edward had unfortunately wanted in mrs s estimation he was as as in s and saw nothing to censure in him but a in which he 
98,strongly resembled and peculiarly delighted her sister of saying too much what he thought on every occasion without attention to persons or circumstances in hastily forming and giving his of other people in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment of attention where his heart was engaged and in too easily the forms of worldly propriety he displayed a want of caution which could not approve in spite of all that be and could say in its support began now to perceive that the desperation and which had seized her at sixteen and a half of ever seeing a man who could satisfy her ideas of perfection had been rash and was all that her fancy had in that unhappy hour and in every brighter period as capable of her and his behaviour declared his wishes to be in that respect as earnest as his abilities were strong her mother too in whose mind not one thought of their marriage had been raised by hb prospect of riches was led before the end of a week to hope and expect it and secretly to congratulate herself on having gained two such in law as edward and colonel s partiality for which had so early been discovered by his friends now first became perceptible to when it ceased to be noticed by them their attention and wit were drawn off to his more fortunate rival and the which the other had incurred before any partiality arose was removed when his feelings began really to call for the ridicule so justly to sensibility was obliged though unwillingly to believe that the sentiments which mrs had assigned bim for her own satisfaction were now actually excited by her sister and that however a general resemblance of disposition between the parties might forward the affection of mr an equally striking opposition of character was no to the regard of colonel she saw it with concern for what could a silent man of five and thirty hope when opposed to a very lively one of five and twenty and as she could not even wish him successful she heartily wished him indifferent she liked him â in spite of his gravity and reserve she beheld in him an object of interest his manners though serious were mild and his reserve appeared rather the result of some oppression of spirits than of any natural of temper sir john had dropped hints of past injuries and disappointments which justified her belief of his being an unfortunate man and she regarded him with respect and compassion perhaps she pitied and esteemed him the more because he was by and who prejudiced against him for being neither lively nor young seemed ed to his merits sense and is just the kind of man said one day when they were talking of together whom every body speaks well of and nobody cares about whom all are delighted to see and nobody remembers to talk to that is exactly what i think of him cried do not boast of it however said for it is injustice in both of you he is highly esteemed by all the family at the park and i never see him myself without taking pains to converse with him that he is by you replied is certainly in his favour but as for the esteem of the others it is a reproach in itself who would submit to the of being approved by such woman as lady and mrs that could command the indifference of any body else but perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself and will make amends for the regard of lady and her mother if their praise is censure your censure may be praise for they are not more than you are prejudiced and unjust in of your you can even be my as you call him is a sensible man and sense will always have attractions for me yes even in a man between thirty and forty he has seen a great deal of the world has been abroad has read and has a thinking mind i have found him capable of giving me much information on various and he has always answered my with readiness of good breeding and good nature that is to say cried contemptuously he has told you that in the east indies the climate is hot and the are troublesome he would have told me so i doubt not had i made any such but they happened to be points on which i had been previously informed perhaps said his observations may have extended to the existence of gold and i may venture to say that his observations have stretched much further than your but why should you dis like him i do not dislike him i consider him on the contrary b and as a very respectable man has every body s good word and nobody s notice who has more money than he can spend more time than he knows how to employ and two new every year add to which cried that he has neither genius taste nor spirit that his understanding has no brilliancy his feelings no and his voice no expression you decide on his so much in the mass replied and so much on the strength of your own imagination that the am able to give of him is comparatively cold and i can only pronounce him to be a sensible man well bred well informed of gentle address and i believe possessing an amiable heart miss dash wood cried you are now using me you are endeavouring to me by reason and to convince me against my will but it will not do you find me as stubborn as you can be artful i have three reasons for colonel he has threatened me with rain when i wanted it to be fine he has found fault with the hanging of my and i cannot persuade him to buy my 
99,brown mare if it will be any satisfaction to you however to be told that i believe his character to be in other respects i am ready to confess it and in return for an acknowledgment which must give me some pain you cannot deny me the privilege of him as much as ever chapter xi had mrs or her daughters imagined when they first came into that so many engage ments would arise to occupy their time as shortly presented themselves or that they should have such frequent invitations and such constant as to leave them little leisure for serious employment yet such was the case when was recovered the schemes of amusement at home and abroad which sir john had been previously forming were put into execution the private balls at the park then began and parties on the water were made and accomplished as often sense as a october would allow in ever r meeting of the kind was included and the ease and familiarity which naturally attended these parties were exactly calculated to give increasing intimacy to his acquaintance with thâ to afford him opportunity of witnessing the of oi marking his animated admiration of her and of receiving in her behaviour to himself the most pointed assurance of her affection could not be surprised at their attachment she only wished that it were less openly shown and once or twice did venture to suggest the propriety of some self command to but all concealment where no real disgrace could attend and to aim at the restraint of sentiments which were not in themselves appeared to her not merely an unnecessary effort but a disgraceful of reason to common place and mistaken notions thought the same and their behaviour at all times was an illustration of their opinions when he was present she had no eyes for any one else every thing he did was right every thing he said was clever if their evenings at the park were concluded with cards he cheated himself and all the rest of the party to get her a good hand if dancing formed the amusement of the night they were partners for half the time and when obliged to separate for a couple of dances were careful to stand together and scarcely spoke a word to any body else such conduct made them of course most exceedingly laughed at but ridicule could not shame and seemed hardly to provoke them mrs entered into all their feelings with a warmth which left her no inclination for checking this excessive display of them to her it was but the natural consequence of a strong affection in a young and ardent mind this was the season of happiness to her heart was devoted to and the fond attachment to which she brought with her from was more likely to be softened than she had thought it possible before by the charms which his society bestowed on her present home s happiness was not so great her heart was not so much at ease nor her satisfaction in their amusements so pure they afforded her no companion that could make amends for what she had left behind nor that could teach sense and her to think of with less regret than ever neither lady nor mrs could supply to her the conversation she missed although the latter was an ever lasting and from the first had regarded her with a kindness which her a large share of her discourse she had already repeated her own history to three or four times and had s memory been equal to her of improvement she might have known very early in her acquaintance all the particulars of mr s last illness and what he said to his wife a few minutes before ho died lady was more agreeable than her mother only in being more silent needed little observation to perceive that her reserve was a mere calmness of manner with which sense had nothing to do towards her husband and mother she was the same as to them and intimacy was therefore neither to be looked for nor desired she had nothing to say one day that she had not said the day before her was invariable for even her spirits were always the same and though she did not oppose the parties arranged by her husband provided everything were conducted in style and her two eldest children attended her she never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them than she might have experienced in sitting at home and so little did her presence add to the pleasure of the others by any share in their conversation that they were sometimes only reminded of her being amongst them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys in colonel alone of all her new acquaintance did find a person who could in any degree claim the respect of abilities excite the interest of friendship or give pleasure as a companion was out of the question her admiration and regard even her regard was all his own but he was a lover his attentions were wholly s and a far less agreeable man might have been more generally pleasing colonel unfortunately for himself had no such encouragement to think only of and in with he found the greatest consolation for the total indifference of her sister s compassion for him increased as she had reason to suspect that the misery of disappointed love had already been known to him this suspicion was given by some words sense and sensibility which dropped from him one evening at the park when they were sitting down together by mutual consent while the others were dancing his eyes were fixed on and after a silence of some minutes he said with a faint smile your sister i understand does not approve of second no replied her opinions are all romantic or rather as i believe she considers them impossible to exist 
99,i believe she does but how she it without reflecting on the character of her own father who had himself two wives i know not a few years however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis of common sense and observation and then they may be more easy to define and to justify than the now are by any body but herself this will probably be the case he replied and yet there is something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind that one is sorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions i cannot agree with you there said there are attending such feelings as s which all the charms of enthusiasm and ignorance of the world cannot for her systems have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at and a better acquaintance with the world is what i look forward to as her greatest possible advantage after a short pause he resumed the conversation by saying â does your sister make no distinction in her objections against a a second attachment or is it equally criminal in every body are those who have been disappointed in their choice whether from the of its object or the of circumstances to be equally indifferent during the rest of their lives upon my word i am not acquainted with the of her principles i only know that i never yet heard her admit any instance of a second attachment s being this said he cannot hold but a change a total change of sentiments â no no do not desire it for when the romantic of a young mind are obliged to give way how frequently are they succeeded by such opinions as b and are but too common and too dangerous i speak from experience i once knew a who in temper and mind greatly resembled your sister who thought and judged like her but who from an enforced from a series of unfortunate circumstances here he suddenly appeared to think that he had said too much and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures which might not otherwise have entered s head the lady probably have passed without suspicion had he not convinced miss that what concerned her ought not to escape his lips as it was it required but a slight effort of fancy to connect his emotion with the tender recollection of past regard attempted no more but in her place would not have done so little the whole story would have been speedily formed under her active imagination and every thing established in the most melancholy order of disastrous love chapter as and were walking together the next morning the latter communicated a piece of news to her sister which in spite of all that she knew before of s and want of thought surprised her by its extravagant testimony of both told her with the greatest delight that had given her a se one that he had bred himself on his estate in and which was exactly calculated to carry a woman without considering that it was not in her mother s plan to keep any horse that if she were to alter her resolution in favour of this gift she must buy another for the servant and keep a servant to ride it and after all build a stable to receive them she had accepted the present without hesitation and told her sister of it in he to send his groom into immediately for it she added and when it arrives we will ride every day you shall share its use with me imagine to yourself my dear the delight of a gallop on some of these downs â most unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of â and sensibility felicity to comprehend all the unhappy truths which attended the affair and for some time she refused to submit to them as to an additional servant the expense would be a trifle mamma she was sure would never object to it and any horse would do for him he might always get one at the park as to a stable the merest shed would be sufficient then ventured to doubt the propriety of her receiving such a present from a man so little or at least so lately known to her this was too much you are mistaken said she warmly in supposing i know very little of i have not known him long indeed but i am much better acquainted with him than i am with any other creature in the world except yourself and mamma it is not time or opportunity that is to determine intimacy it is disposition alone seven years would be insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other and seven days are more than enough for others i should hold myself guilty of greater in accepting a horse from my brother than from of john i know very little though we have lived together for years but of my judgment has long been formed thought it wisest to touch that point no more sh knew her sister s temper opposition on so tender a subject would only attach her the more to her own opinion but b an appeal to her affection for her mother by representing thâ which that indulgent mother must draw on herself if as would probably be the case she consented to this increase of establishment was shortly subdued and she promised not to tempt her mother to such kindness by mentioning the offer and to tell when she saw him next that it must be declined she was faithful to her word and when called at the cottage the same day heard her express her disappointment to him in a low voice on being obliged to forego the acceptance of his present the reasons for this alteration were at the same time related and they were such as to make 
99,further ent on his side impossible his concern however was very apparent and after expressing it with earnestness he added in the me low voice but the horse is still yours though you cannot use it now i shall keep it only till you can claim it when you and leave to your own establishment in a more lasting home queen shall receive you this was all overheard by miss and in the whole of the sentence in his manner of it and in his addressing her sister by her christian name alone she instantly saw an intimacy so decided a meaning so direct as marked a perfect agreement between them from that moment she doubted not of their being engaged to each other and the belief of it created no other surprise than that she or any of their friends should be by so frank to discover it by accident margaret related something to her the next day which placed this matter in a still clearer light had spent the preceding evening with them and margaret by being left some time in the parlour with only him and had had opportunity for observations which with a most important face she communicated to her eldest sister when they were next by themselves oh she cried i have such a secret to tell you about i am sure she will be married to mr very soon you have said so replied almost every day since they first met on down and they had not known each other a week i believe before you were certain that wore his picture round her neck but it turned out to be only the miniature of our great uncle but indeed this is quite another thing i am sure they will be married very soon for he has got a lock of her hair take care margaret it may be only the hair of some great of his but indeed it is s i am almost sure it is for i saw him cut it off last night after tea when you and mamma went out of the room they were whispering and talking together as fast as could be and he seemed to be begging something of her and presently he took up her and cut off a long lock of her hair for it was all tumbled down her back and he kissed it and folded it up in a piece of white paper and put it into his pocket book from such particulars stated on such authority could not withhold her credit nor was she disposed to it for the circumstance was in perfect with he had heard and seen herself and margaret s sagacity was not always displayed in a way so satisfactory to her sister when mrs attacked her one evening at the park to give the name of the young man who was s particular which had been long a matter of great curiosity to her margaret answered j looking at her sister and saying i must not tell may f this of course made everybody laugh and tried to laugh too but the effort was painful she was convinced that margaret had fixed on a person whose name she could not bear with composure to become a standing joke with felt for her most sincerely but she did more harm than good to the cause by turning very red and saying in an angry manner to margaret â remember that whatever your conjectures may be you have no right to repeat them i never had any conjectures about it replied margaret it was you who told me of it yourself this increased the mirth of the company and margaret was eagerly pressed to say something more oh pray miss margaret let us know all about it said mrs what is the gentleman s name i must not tell ma am but i know very well what it is and i know where he is too yes yes we can guess where he is at his own house at to be sure he is the of the i dare say no that he is not he is of no profession at all margaret said with great warmth you know that all is an invention of your own and that there is no such person in existence well then he is lately dead for i am sure there was such a man once and his name begins with an f most grateful did feel to lady for observing at this moment that it rained very hard though she believed the interruption to proceed less from any attention to her than from her s great dislike of all such subjects of as delighted her husband and mother the idea however started by her was immediately pursued by colonel who was on every occasion of the feelings of others and much was said on the m subject of rain by both of them opened the piano and asked to sit down to it and amidst the various of different people to quit the topic it fell to the ground but not so easily did recover from the alarm into which it had thrown her a party was formed this evening for going on the following day to see a very fine place about twelve miles from belonging to a brother in law of colonel without whose interest it could not be seen as the proprietor who was then abroad had left strict orders on that head the grounds were declared to be highly beautiful and sir john who was particularly warm in their praise might be allowed to be a tolerable judge for he had formed parties to visit them at least twice every summer for the last ten years they contained a noble piece of water â a sail on which was to a form a great part of the morning s amusement cold provisions were to be taken open carriages 
99,only to be employed and everything conducted in the usual style of a complete party of pleasure to some few of the company it appeared rather a bold undertaking considering the time of year and that it had rained every day for the last fortnight and mrs who had already a cold was persuaded by to stay at home chapter intended excursion to turned out very differently from what had expected she was prepared to be wet through fatigued and frightened but the event was still more unfortunate for they did not go at all by ten o clock the whole party were assembled at the park where they were to breakfast the morning was rather favourable though it had rained all night as the clouds were then across the sky and the sun frequently appeared they were all in high spirits and good humour eager to be happy and determined to submit to the greatest and hardships rather than be otherwise while they were at breakfast the letters were brought in and among the rest there was one for colonel â he took it looked at the direction changed colour and left the room what is the matter with said sir john nobody could tell i hope he has had no bad news said it must be something extraordinary that could make colonel leave my breakfast table so suddenly in about five minutes he returned no bad news colonel i hope said mrs as soon as he entered the room none at all ma am i thank you was it from i hope it is not to say that your sister is worse no ma am it came from town and is merely a letter of business but how came the hand to you so much if it was only a letter of business come come this won t do colonel so let us hear the truth of it my dear madam said lady recollect what you are saying perhaps it is to tell you that your cousin is married said mrs without attending to her daughter s reproof no indeed it is not well then i know who it is from colonel and i hope she is well whom do you mean ma am v said he colouring a little oh i you know who i mean i am particularly sorry ma am said he addressing lady that i should receive letter to day for it is on business which requires my immediate attendance in town in town cried mrs what can you have to do in town at this time of year my own loss is great he continued in being obliged to leave so agreeable a party but i am the more concerned as i fear my presence is necessary to gain your at what a blow upon them all was this but if you write a note to the housekeeper mr said eagerly will it not be b m he shook his head we must go said sir john it shall not be put off when we are so near it you cannot go to town till tomorrow that is all i wish it could be so easily settled but it is not in my power to delay my journey for one day if you would but let us know what your business is said mrs we might see whether it could be put off or not you would not be six hours later said if you were to your journey till our return i cannot afford to lose me hour then heard say in a low voice to there are some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure is one of them he was afraid of catching cold i dare say and invented this trick for getting out of it i would lay guineas the letter was of his own writing i have no doubt of it replied there is no persuading you to change your mind i know of old said sir john when once you are determined on anything but however i hope you will think better of it consider here are the two miss come over from the three walked up from the cottage and mr got up two hours before his usual time on purpose to go to â one again repeated sorrow at being the cause of the party but at the same time declared it to be well then when will you come back again i hope we shall see you at added her as soon as you can conveniently leave town and we must put off the party to till you return you are very obliging but it is so uncertain when i may have it in my power to return that i dare not engage for it at all oh he must and shall come back cried sir john if he is not here by the end of the week i shall go after him ay so do sir john cried mrs and then perhaps you may find out what his business is i do not want to into other men s concerns i sup pose it is something he is ashamed of and sensibility colonel s horses were announced you do not go to town on horseback do you added sir john no only to i shall then go post well as you are resolved to go i wish you a good journey but you had better change your mind i assure you it is not in my power he then took leave of the whole party is there no chance of my seeing you and your sisters in town this winter miss v i am afraid none at all then i must bid you farewell for a longer time than i should wish to do to he merely bowed and said nothing come colonel said mrs before you go do let us know what you are going about he wished her a good 
100,morning and attended by sir john left the room the complaints and which politeness had hitherto restrained now burst forth universally and they all agreed again and again how provoking it was to be so disappointed i can guess what his business is however said mrs can you ma am said almost every body yes it is about miss i am sure and who is miss asked what do not you know who miss is i am sure you must have heard of her before she is a relation of the my dear a very near relation we will not say how near for fear of shocking the young ladies then lowering her voice a little she said to she is his natural daughter indeed oh yes and as like him as she can stare i dare say the colonel will leave her all his fortune when sir john returned he joined most heartily in the general regret on so unfortunate an event concluding however by observing that as they were all got together th must do something by way of being happy and after some consultation it was agreed that although happiness could only been at they might procure a tolerable composure of mind by driving about the country the carriages were then ordered was first and never looked happier than when she got into it he drove through the park very fast and they were soon out of sight and nothing more of them was seen till their return which did not happen till after the return of all the rest they both seemed delighted with their drive but said only in general terms that they had kept in the lanes while the others went on the downs it was settled that there should be a dance in the evening and that every body should be extremely merry all day long some more of the came to dinner and they had the pleasure of sitting down nearly twenty to table which sir john observed with great contentment took his usual place between the two elder dash wood mrs sat on s right hand and they had not been long seated before she behind her and and said to loud enough for them both to hear have found you out in spite of all your tricks i know where you uie morning coloured and replied very hastily where pray f did not you know said that we had been out in my yes yes mr impudence i know that very well and was determined to find out where you had been to i hop you like your house miss it is a very large one i know and when i come to see you i hope you will have new furnished it for it wanted it very much when i was there six years ago turned away in great confusion mrs laughed heartily and found that in her resolution to know where they had been she had actually made her own woman of mr s groom and that she had by that method been informed that they had gone to and spent a considerable time there in walking about the garden and going all over the the house hardly believe this to be true as it seemed very unlikely that should propose or consent to enter the house while mrs smith was in it with whom had not the smallest acquaintance en e and as soon as they left the dining room of her about it and great was her surprise when she found that every circumstance related by mrs was perfectly true was quite angry with her for doubting it why should you imagine that we did not go there or that we did not see the house f is not it what you have often wished to do yourself yes but i would not go while mrs smith was there and with no other companion than mr mr however is the only person who can have a right to show that house and as he went in an open carriage it was impossible to have any other companion i never spent a pleasanter morning in my life i am afraid replied that the of an employment does not always its propriety i n the contrary nothing can be a stronger proof of it for if there had been any real in what i hav e been i ble of it at the t w always know when we are acting g and with such a conviction i could have had no pleasure but my dear as it has already exposed you to some very impertinent remarks do you not now begin to doubt the discretion of your own conduct if the impertinent remarks of mrs are to be the proof of in conduct we are all offending every moment of our lives i value not her censure any more than i should do her i am not sensible of having done anything in walking over mrs smith s grounds or in seeing her house they will one day be mr s and if they were one day to be your own you would not be justified in what you have done she blushed at this hint but it was even visibly gratifying to her and after a ten minutes interval of earnest thought she came to her sister again and said with great good humour perhaps it w as rather ill judged in me to go to but mr wanted particularly to show me the place and it is a charming house i assure you there is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs of a nice comfortable size for constant use and with modern furniture it would be delightful it is a corner room â n sense and has windows on two sides on one side you look across the green behind the house to a beautiful hanging wood and on lâ e other you have 
100,a view of the church and village and beyond them of those fine bold hills that we have so often admired i did not see it to advantage for nothing be more forlorn than the furniture but if it were newly fitted a couple of hundred pounds says would make it one of the summer rooms in england could have listened to her without interruption from the others she would have described every room in the house with equal delight chapter xiv the sudden termination of colonel s visit at the park with his in concealing its cause filled the mind and raised the wonder of mrs for two or three days she was a great as every one must be who takes a very lively interest in all the and of all their acquaintance she wondered with little what could be the reason of it was sure there must be some bad news and thought over every kind of distress that could have befallen him with a fixed determination that he should not escape them all something very melancholy must be the matter i am sure said she i could see it in his face poor man i am afraid his circumstances may be bad the estate at was never reckoned more than two thousand a year and his brother left everything sadly involved i do think he must have been sent for about money matters for what else can it be i wonder whether it is so i would give anything to know the truth of it perhaps it is about miss â and by the by i dare say it is because he looked so conscious when i mentioned her may be she is ill in town nothing in the world more likely for i have a notion she is always rather sickly i would lay any it is about miss it is not so very likely he should be distressed in circumstances now or he is a very prudent e and sensibility man and to be sure must have cleared the estate by this time i wonder what it can be may be his sister is worse at and has sent for him over his setting off in such a hurry seems very like it well i wish him out of all his trouble with all my heart and a good wife into the bargain so wondered so talked mrs her opinion varying with every fresh conjecture and all seeming equally probable as they arose though she felt really interested in the welfare of colonel could not bestow all the wonder on his going so suddenly away which mrs was desirous of her feeling for besides that the circumstance did not in her opinion justify such lasting amazement or variety of speculation her wonder was otherwise disposed of it was engrossed by the extraordinary silence of her sister and on th subject which they must know to be peculiarly interesting to them all as this silence continued every day made it appear more strange and more with the disposition of both why they should not openly acknowledge to her mother and herself what their constant behaviour to each other declared to have taken place could not imagine she could easily conceive that marriage might not be immediately in their power for though was independent there was no reason to believe him rich his estate had been by sir john at about six or seven hundred a year but he lived at an expense to which that income could hardly be equal and he had himself often complained of his poverty but for this strange kind of secrecy maintained by them relative to their engagement which in fact concealed nothing at all she could not account and it was so wholly contradictory to their general opinions and practice that a doubt sometimes entered her mind of their being really engaged and this doubt was enough to prevent her making any of nothing could be more expressive of attachment to them all than s behaviour to it had all the tenderness which a lover s heart could give and to the rest of the family it was the affectionate attention of a son and a brother the cottage seemed to be considered and loved by him as his home many more of his hours were spent there than at and if no general engagement and â them at the park the exercise which called him out in the ro mm was almost certain of ending there where ihe rest of the day was spent by himself at the side of anne and by his favourite at her feet one evening in particular about a week after colonel left the country his heart seemed more than usually open to every feeling of attachment to the objects around him and on mrs s happening to mention her design of improving the cottage in the spring he warmly opposed every alteration of a place which had established as perfect with him what he exclaimed â improve this dear cottage no that i will never consent to not a tone must be added to its walls not an inch to its size if my feelings are regarded do not be alarmed said miss dash wood nothing of the kind will be done for my mother will never have money enough to attempt it i am heartily glad of it he cried may she always be poor if she can employ her riches no better thank you but you may be assured that i would not sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment of yours or of any one whom i love for all the improvements in the world depend upon it that whatever sum may remain when i make up my accounts in the spring i would even rather lay it by than dispose of it in a manner so painful to you but are you really so attached to this place as 
100,to see no defect in it i am said he to me it is nay more i consider it as the only form of building in which happiness is and were i rich enough i would instantly pull down and build it up again in the exact plan of this cottage with dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that i suppose said yes cried he in the same eager tone with all and every thing belonging to it â in no one convenience or inconvenience about it should the least be perceptible then and then only under such a roof i might perhaps be as happy at as i have been at i flatter myself replied that even under the disadvantage of better rooms and a broader staircase you will hereafter find your own house as as you now do this and sensibility there certainly are circumstances said which might greatly it to me but this place will always have one claim of my affection which no other can possibly share mrs looked with pleasure at whose fine eyes were fixed so on as plainly how well she understood him how often did i wish added he when i was at this time that cottage were inhabited i never passed within view of it without admiring its situation and that no one should live in it how little did i then think that the very first news i should hear from mrs smith i next came into the country would be that cottage was taken and i felt an immediate satisfaction and interest in the vent which nothing but a kind of of what happiness i should experience from it can account for must it not have been so speaking to her in a lowered voice then continuing his former tone he said and yet this house you would spoil mi s you would rob it of its simplicity hy imaginary improvement and this dear parlour in which our acquaintance first began and in which so many happy hours have been since spent by us together you would to the condition of a common entrance and every body would be eager to pass through the room which has contained within itself more real accommodation and comfort than any other apartment of the dimensions in the world could possibly afford mrs again assured him that no alteration of the kind should be attempted you are a good woman he warmly replied your promise makes me easy extend it a little farther and it will make me happy tell me that not only your house will remain the same but that i shall ever find you and yours as unchanged as your dwelling and that you will always consider me with the kindness which has made everything belonging to you so dear to me the promise was readily given and s behaviour during the whole of the evening declared at once his affection and happiness shall we see you to morrow to dinner said mrs dash wood when he was leaving them i do not ask you tc and en come in the morning for we mast walk to the to call on lady he engaged to be with them by four o clock chapter xv mrs s visit to lady took place the day and two of her daughters went with her but excused herself from being of the party under some trifling pretext of employment and her mother who concluded that a promise had been made by the night before of calling on her while they were absent was perfectly satisfied with her remaining at home on their return from the park they found s and servant in waiting at the cottage and mrs was convinced that her conjecture had been just so far it was all as she had foreseen but on entering the house she beheld what no foresight had taught her to expect they were no sooner in the passage than came hastily out of the parlour apparently in violent affliction with her handkerchief at her eyes and without noticing them ran up stairs surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room she had just quitted where they found only who was leaning against the mantel piece with his back towards them he turned round on their coming in and his countenance showed that he strongly partook of the emotion which overpowered is anything the matter with her cried mrs as she entered â is she ill i i hope not he replied trying to look cheerful and with a forced smile presently added it is i who may rather expect to be ill â for i am now suffering under a very heavy disappointment p yes for i am unable to keep my engagement with you mrs smith has this morning exercised the privilege of riches upon a poor dependent cousin by sending me on business to london i have just received my and taken my of and by way of i am now come to take my farewell of you sense and sensibility to london â and are you going this morning almost this moment this is very unfortunate but mrs smith must bâ obliged and her business will not detain you from us long i hope he coloured as he replied you are very kind but i have no idea of returning into immediately my visits to mrs smith are never repeated within the and is mrs smith your only friend is the only house in the neighbourhood to which you will be welcome for shame can you wait for an invitation here his colour increased and with his eyes fixed on the ground he only replied you are too good mrs looked at with surprise felt equal amazement for a few moments every one was silent mrs first spoke i have only to add my dear that at cottage you will always be welcome for i will not press you to return 
100,here immediately because you only can judge how far that might be pleasing to mrs smith and on this head i shall be no more disposed to question your judgment than to doubt your inclination my engagements at present replied are of such a nature â that â i dare not flatter myself he mrs was too much astonished to speak and another pause succeeded this was broken by who said with a faint smile it is folly to linger in this manner i will not torment myself any longer by remaining among friends whose society it is impossible for me now to enjoy he then hastily took leave of them all and left the room they saw him step into his and in a minute it was out of sight mrs felt too much for speech and instantly quitted the parlour to give way in solitude to the concern and alarm which this sudden departure occasioned s uneasiness was at least equal to her mother s she thought of what had just passed with anxiety and distrust s behaviour in taking leave of them his and embarrassment and affectation of cheerfulness and above all his to accept her mother s invitation a so unlike a lover so unlike himself greatly disturbed her one moment she feared that no serious design had ever been formed on his side and the next that some unfortunate quarrel had taken place between him and her sister â the distress in which had quitted the room was such as a serious quarrel could most reasonably account for though when she considered what s love for him was a quarrel seemed almost impossible but whatever might be the particulars of their separation her sister s affliction was and she thought with the tenderest compassion of that violent sorrow which was in all probability not merely giving way to as a relief but feeding and encouraging as a duty in about half an hour her mother returned and though her eyes were red her countenance was not our dear is now some miles from said she as she sat down to work and with how heavy a heart does he travel it is all very strange so suddenly to be gone it seems but the work of a moment and last night he was with us so happy so cheerful so affectionate and now after only ten minutes notice â gone too without intending to return â something more than what he owned to us must have happened he did not speak he did not behave like you must have seen the difference as well as i what can it be can they have quarrelled why else should he have shown such to accept your invitation here it was not inclination that he wanted i could plainly see that he had not the power of accepting it i have thought it all over i assure you and i can perfectly account for everything that at first seemed strange to me as well as to you can you indeed yes i have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory way but you who love to doubt where you can â it will not satisfy i know but you shall not talk me out of my trust in it i am persuaded that mrs smith his regard for of it and because she has other views for him and on that account is eager to get him away and that the business which she sends him off to is invented as an excuse to dismiss him this is what i believe to have happened he is moreover aware that she does the connection he dares not therefore at present confess to h r his engagement with and he feels himself obliged from his dependent tion to give in to her schemes and absent himself from for a while you will tell me i know that this may or may not have happened but i will listen to no unless you can point out any other method of understanding the affair as satisfactory as this and now what have you to say nothing for you have anticipated my answer then you would have told me that it might or might not have happened oh how incomprehensible are your feelings you had rather take evil upon credit than good you had rather look out for misery for and guilt for poor than an apology for the latter you are resolved to think him because he took leave of us with less affection than his usual behaviour has shown and is no allowance to be made for or for spirits depressed by recent disappointment are no to be accepted because they are not is no thing due to the man whom we have all such reason to love and no reason in the world to think ill of to the possibility of motives in themselves though secret for a while and after all what is it you suspect him of i can hardly tell myself but suspicion of something unpleasant is the inevitable consequence of such an alteration as we just witnessed in him there is great truth however in what you have now urged of the which ought to be made for him and it is my wish to be candid in my judgment of every body may undoubtedly have very sufficient reasons for his conduct and i will hope that he has but it would have been more like to acknowledge them at once secrecy may be advisable but still i cannot help wondering at its being by him do not blame him however for departing from his and where the is bat really do admit the justice of what t hare said in his defence â i am happy â and he is not entirely it may be proper to their engagement if they ore engaged from mrs smith and if that is e case it must
