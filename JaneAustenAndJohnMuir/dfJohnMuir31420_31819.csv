religion who by pen and tongue have brightened and the hearts and homes of thousands amidst the of nature instead of the bustle and bewildering attractions of city life they have grown strong to do battle for the right and to bear testimony to the truth as it is in of this class is the one whose life and labors we are now to consider is an lake two thirds of which lie in the eastern of canada in the province of and the upper third in its extreme length from north to south is about thirty miles its breadth varying from one to three miles it is semi circular in form and with islands while on its western shore rise mountains of no ordinary attractions among them owl s head which towers about feet above the surface of the lake affording from its summit a view of surpassing loveliness it was at the outlet of this lake there was born mar the youngest daughter of b and wild johnson and there she spent â with the exception of the time devoted to attending or teaching school â almost her entire life of cities she knew nothing by experience but as her reading was extensive she knew much of the world by mental the book of nature was her delight its illustrations of stones and streams lakes and rivers mountains and forests birds and flowers were ever attractive to her at an early age she began to exhibit rare poetic talent of a number of short pieces between the ages of twelve and fifteen years the following entitled the forest has been preserved it appeared in the journal â a paper to which she afterwards frequently contributed it was probably the first article she ever had printed let others seek sweet s voice when grief the spirit let them find solace in the tones of their beloved friends but oh when sorrow o er me give me the dark the dark green woods when pleasure lights the sparkling eye and with rapture proud let others spend their joyous mirth within the giddy crowd but when o er me no clouds are seen give me the forest dark and green when pure devotion fills the heart and breathes a yearning prayer let others wander to the church and pay their tribute there but if o er me such feelings steal li the dark forest let me kneel when death comes o er the pallid brow to number with the dead sketch let others choose some lovely grave where tears will oft be shed but let me let find a tomb deep iu the forest s darkening gloom her life was not one of thrilling adventure escapes and deeds securing worldly applause but quiet and useful her constitution was naturally weak â her brain too active for her body and as a consequence much mental and physical suffering was her portion to her studies â french latin and drawing besides the english branches â she was very devoted nothing pleased her better than to be alone with books pen and pencil or to wander forth in garden or field being of a very and retiring disposition she felt alone even in company her leaves give evidence of this under date of june for example she writes how lonely i feel to day and my rebellious heart will repeat the question why was i created thus i stand alone and why i know it is my own self that makes me so but how can i make myself otherwise i have tried very hard to overcome my â what shall i call it it seems as though it could not be wholly that i have seen those the world called but they were not at all like myself oh no i am wretched at times on account of this when i see myself all alone â different from those around me â i cannot stay the burning tear though i would gladly repress it i cannot soothe the anguish that fills my heart and yet i feel that this is wrong â that it ought not to be thus why should i feel so keenly that i am alone that i am strange earthly scenes will soon be over wild flowers and if i am only a i shall 
1,never feel alone in heaven oh thought there will be no strange being there god prepare me for that world and i will no longer complain of my loneliness on earth â no longer sigh that i am not like others at this time miss johnson was not a professed christian her parents had endeavored to bring her up in the fear of the lord and a belief of the gospel and to attend the services of the her life had been one of strict morality she believed in god but had not taken christ as her personal and confessed him before men as she felt she should her conviction of sin however was deep and on another day in the same month she says â earth thou art a lovely place and some of thy inhabitants are as lovely and happy as see that beautiful bird with shining and brilliant crest and hear the melodious notes that arise from its silvery throat its form beauty and its song happiness see those snow white over the grass â now beside their mothers then springing forward bounding from to and filling the air with strains of joy and delight see yonder butterfly weighing itself upon that brilliant flower his gorgeous wings are expanded and glittering in the sun like sparkling gems see those bright eyed children their glowing cheeks their beaming eyes and above ail their clear and merry laugh happiness pure and unbounded earth is truly lovely but its inhabitants are not all happy oh no not all for one who loves the beauties of earth in the life of nature and finds her chief pleasures in the spreading grove by the brook among the brilliant flowers is sad and unhappy and why because she has learned too soon that there is no such thing as real and abiding happiness on earth that the fairest plants that pleasure is a phantom â false and fleeting truly she has learned all this and will she never learn to raise her eyes to that bright world where true happiness only and to trust meekly in him who is the only of peace and joy later we have another entry in which after again referring to the beauties of nature she life life i fain would read thy mysteries i fain would draw aside every and behold for what purpose i was created was it to be an heir of sorrow was it to live for myself alone and then pass away and let my memory perish with me no i was born for a better â a higher and more holy purpose i was not born to pass a few moments on the stage of life and then disappear forever with a shudder i turn away and would gladly forget to think o thought thought thou wilt me â thou hast almost hurled reason from her throne thou bitter depart if but for a moment and let me once more find peace but no the more i seek to still nearer the demon thought thought it rushes forth from my soul like the wild of the mountains and me with its burning tide till body mind and soul â all all are exhausted and lie like a straw upon the roaring bosom of the deep oh that i could arise mingle with the gay and forget my own deep thoughts but no such thoughts like the soul gave them birth can never die wild thought what art thou a blessing to angels a curse to me distracted soul sink into repose others are happy and thou born to be more wretched than they truly thou and why because thou only in the regions of thought â thought which is burning my brain and piercing my heart and yet a thought with light beams through the dark clouds which its darker sisters have thrown around me and the only inscription which it bears is live for others and another thought follows in rapid succession â like a far off echo it the words of its live for others and then adds while a vivid flash of the lightning of truth lights up the darkness of error live for god and for heaven a loud crash follows of thunder shake the atmosphere of my soul self has fallen i will live for others for god and for heaven this was a grand resolve but not yet was the to be out of prison the pilgrim to be freed from the of once more she has to write â everything is beautiful and all nature is glad and rejoicing arise my soul and be thou glad likewise cast off thy gloomy fears the god who made all the beautiful things by which thou art surrounded is not of thee oh wondrous condescension god is not forgetful of e he upon me with an eye of compassion he my distress and my weakness amazing love oh that i were more worthy of it oh that i loved him as fervently as i ought but my heart is and i

weight of sorrow presses upon life sketch my and i vainly strive to free mj self from its influence everything looks dark my god my god why hast thou forsaken me why art thou so far from helping me

1,last supper which christ partook of with his presented itself to my mind and then i looked forward with joyful hope to the day all the saints of god shall eat bread in his glorious kingdom â when all of every age and shall be gathered around the table and christ himself be in their midst it was a soul inspiring thought and for all the wealth of a thousand worlds like this i would not have been absent from that communion â from which i had so often myself yes i had never before of the lord s supper and it my own wicked heart which had kept me away for god had called loudly upon me and his holy spirit had again and again life sketch with me oh what a sinner i have been and what a long suffering god i that he did not cast me off forever oh what mercy bless the lord my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name bless the lord my soul and forget not all his and now have i forsaken all for christ have i thrown body soul and it â upon the altar i do want to sacrifice everything for christ and bi the grace of god i will x the following â when my duty appears plain i will do it whatever may be the consequences i will never be ashamed to confess christ before the world i will my talents entirely to the lord i will never employ my pen in writing anything which i might regret at the bar of god i will never permit any one of my to be printed unless i can in sincerity ask the blessing of god to attend it â as i shall be brought into judgment for every idle word i say i will endeavor never to engage in trifling conversation but on every proper occasion to speak of the wondrous grace of god i will whenever a good occurs warn my young companions to flee from the wrath to come i will strive to set my affections on things above not on things on the earth â by the assistance of the holy spirit i will endeavor to keep evil thoughts out of my heart and to upon the law of god i will never pass a day without seeking some secret place at least twice a day and pouring out my soul in prayer to god wild i will study the holy and endeavor to understand what i read i try to do all i can god assist me to perform what i have written in thy fear and to thy glory i am perfect weakness but thou my frame thou that i am dust i know thou art merciful oh give me a more exalted faith help me to come boldly forward and claim thy promises as mine humble my pride keep me at thy feet let not the temptations of satan overcome me but may i trust myself in thine arms may i love thee fervently above everything else â better far than my own life i can do nothing unless thou dost assist me oh support me and save me at last in thy kingdom for christ s sake in the evening of that ever memorable sabbath she aloud a few words of prayer at the family altar and next day as she was then teaching had prayer in her school thus she confessed with the mouth the lord while in her heart she believed that god had raised him from the dead immediately after the son of god himself was he was in the wilderness tempted of the devil j it need not be thought strange therefore if his followers soon after their are also by the same adversary this young christian did not escape him entirely yet from that day until her death though conscious of much weakness and having many dark days and great sufferings she never her to the king of kings who had bought her life sketch witli his blood a few more from her will show the working of her mind about this time a calm and quiet morning a soothing calm over my soul faith with triumphant wing rises far above the scenes of earth and points to that glorious world where christ for me before the throne of his father the doubts which have so long filled my heart are sinful and to god and i will no longer give place to them i will look away from myself â from my sins â to the holy lamb of god i will trust in him and in his merits alone for acceptance sunday what i have done to day would once have seemed impossible the cross that i have taken up would have seemed almost i could not have believed the last time i attended the prayer meeting that at the next one i should stand up as a witness for christ but thank god my proud heart has in some degree been and the dearest hope i now cherish is that christ may not be ashamed to confess me before his father and all the holy angels a while standing this evening by the grave of one dearly beloved in life and cherished more fondly now that death has taken her from my embrace i could not stay the soaring flight of fancy which would to my mind in vivid colors our meeting at the great and the thought that that meeting was so near â that in a very little while the grave should lose its power and that she would come forth in immortal beauty filled my soul with transport and almost brought to my lips the yearning cry come lord and come quickly on the th of august miss closed her wild flowers and after spending a few weeks at home went to the academy at centre

lofty hills and waving forests where the human voice had never yet been heard or other sound save when the depths were stirred by the loud screams of some lone midnight bird but high o er all the lofty city rose firm in its strength sublime in its repose on every hand by nature fortified and strongly built with air of conscious pride gazed from its heights upon the scene below and bade defiance to each lurking foe confiding in its firm and sure it calmly slept and deemed itself secure the river swept along with roar its waves dashed on the rocky shore while on its broad bosom lay the twinkling in beautiful array and every drop shone clear and bright bathed in a flood of soft and silvery light scarcely a ripple stirred its quiet breast for every sighing breeze was to rest and every sound was hushed on earth in air and silence held supreme dominion there sleep sent his angels forth with silent tread from house to house they on their mission sped watched by the couch of suffering and pain soothed the pale brow and the throbbing brain the sad heart and closed the weeping eye patriotic poems bade care and grief attendants fly entered the chamber of the rich and great nor scorned to visit those of mean estate ent blessed alike the lofty and the low alike bade each forget their weight of woe the proud and wealthy drew around their breast the curtains of repose and sank to rest the pallid sons of want and hunger slept and sorrow s sons forgot that they had wept the night wore slowly on the dismal tower had long since the lonely midnight hour a proud band by daring impulse led approached the river with a cautious tread with eye and with an eager air the boats that waited for them there in silence left the calm and peaceful shore in sullen silence plied the hasty oar in silence passed the quiet stream while ever and anon a j ale sad and cast a hasty glance on polished dagger and on gleaming lance the scene was mournful and with magic art it acted strangely on each manly heart no speedy action now no rude alarm called forth their powers or the arm no present danger used its strong control to rouse the passions of the warrior s soul but all to place thought on her throne and yield the reins of power to her alone the past came slowly forth with all its train of scenes that ne er might be again of mournful and sighs of pallid faces and of tearful eyes wild flowers of aching hearts that heaved with sorrow s swell and broken tones that sadly breathed farewell and in the silence of that lonely hour which bade the own its wondrous power a small still voice whispered in every soul although each sought to burst from its control to morrow the moon as fair as now may shed her beams upon your death sealed brow to morrow night the stars may the wave while you perchance may fill a soldier s grave to morrow night your spirit may explore the boundless regions of an shore to morrow night may you with the slain and weeping love watch your return in vain and yet not long such gloomy thoughts might rest within the soldier s brave and gallant breast not long the warrior panting for the held and for the battle s horrid din might yield his fearless spirit unto sorrow s sway or dread the issue of the coming day the momentary sadness now was o er as with new hopes they the frowning shore landed in silence and in stern array pressed firmly forward on their dangerous way mounted the rugged rocks with footsteps slow and left the murmuring river far below from cliff to cliff the gallant army spring nor envy now the eagle s soaring wing they view their labors o er their object gain and proudly stand on the lovely plain gaze down upon the awful scenes they ve passed that they ve reached the heights at last hope lights each eye and fills each manly breast where wild desires and aspirations rest poems it bids each doubt and every shadow flee and points them on to certain victory the morning dawned the beams of light on a strange and a romantic sight â on glistening and on nodding crest on waving banner and on steel clad breast the city woke â but woke to hear the cry to arms to arms the foe â the foe is nigh she woke to hear the trumpet s wild â she woke to hear the sound of arms â she woke to view her confidence removed â she woke to view her trusted safety proved her mighty long her pride and boast all safely mounted by a british host â she woke to view her lofty yield her plains converted to a battle field her gallant troops in wild disorder fly the british banner floating to the sky and proudly waving o er the bloody plain o er heaps of dying and o er heaps of slain from their hasty dreams with brows aghast on every hand the soldiers gather fast bind on their seize the glittering sword form in a line and at a simple word with hurried steps advance toward the shore with hasty gestures grasp the trembling oar across the river s bosom swiftly glide and safely land upon the other side drawn up in battle order now they stand waiting in silence for their chief s command then onward move with firm and stately tread with waving and proudly 
4,spread with gleaming sword and with uplifted lance where now the glistening dance wild flowers but long before those decline streams of dark blood shall all their shine those beams shall strive to tlie steel in vain for human the polished steel shall stain the sun rose clear that with ardent glow he shed his beams o er friend and foe his golden hues the spreading fields adorn waving in beauty the corn give richer colors to the lofty trees that gently rustle in the morning breeze they the river s surface calm and blue and shine reflected in the sparkling dew oh ye who stand prepared for deadly strife for blood and for a brother s life behold the glories that around you lie the harmony earth and sky behold the wondrous skill and power displayed in every leaf and every lowly blade on every hand behold the wondrous love of him who in majesty above â who bids for man all nature sweetly smile and sends his rain upon the just and vile his attribute is love and shall ye dare to take the life mercy and love would spare shall ye destroy what he has formed to live and take away what ye can never give shall mortal claim the right his own belonging to alone rash man forbear and stay the ready dart that seeks to lodge within thy brother s heart but no for mercy s voice now hushed and still no longer may the steel clad bosom thrill and hearts that melted once at other s woe â that kindled once with friendship s fervent glow â poems that once had felt and owned the soothing power of tender love â are in the hour when savage war makes bare his awful arm and in thunder tones his dread alarm but there were some m those devoted bands o er whom the scenes of other lands came w wildly and piercing gaze they looked an instant on their boyhood s days remembered well the hours that flew too fast some with whom those hours were past j and mid the group of dear companions gay well some whom they saw that day but sprang not forward with familiar grasp and friendly air the proffered hand to clasp but looked away and with a pang of pain that they e er had met again for now they met not as they met before â not as they used to meet in days of not arm in arm like brothers fondly tried whom they could trust and in whose love confide met not as once high and mutual aim in classic halls to seek for future fame but met as bitter foes in deadly strife each wildly panting for the other s life with armies proud and swelling like the flood to wreath their in each other s blood they once were friends but france and england rose in sounding arms and they are hostile foes they once were friends but friendship may not shield the warrior s breast upon the battle held they once were friends but hark the cannon s roar loudly that they are friends no more from rank to rank the flies wild flowers rank to rank tlie groans of rise after rank is numbered witli the slain e follows rank and upon the plain bravely they fought with zeal in human they dipped the shining steel pressed o er the heaps of dying and of dead where warriors groaned and gallant heroes from their lips in quick and stifled breath arose the cry of victory or death louder and louder still the awful roar from the heights and shook the frightened shore thick clouds of smoke enveloped friend and foe the thunder shook the depths below mountain and echoing forest joined the cry and distant hills gave back the same reply with voice and waving hand the british leader cheered his gallant band pressed firmly forward where one endless tide of woe and reigned on every side â where streams of blood in crimson torrents rolled â where death smote down alike the young and old and where the poured the deadly shot the gallant with daring fought the dead and dying in his pathway lie before him ranks divide and fly with arm and with aim he adds new glories to his former fame the reward of all his toil for now fresh around his youthful brow but what avail they for the fatal dart of death has lodged within that hoping heart the lofty head that wore the waving crest poems now sadly upon the bleeding breast that mighty arm in power and pride falls feebly down and casts its aside the laurel wreath that brow in vain for lo the hero lies among the slain the french fought long with courage and with skill with iron arms and with an iron will bravely forward mid the battle s din to die or else the victory win like soldiers true fought firmly and fought well and at their post like faithful soldiers fell deeper and deeper now the conflict grows despair nerves these and victory those tis the last struggle hark they fly they fly the depths and the sky tis the last struggle for the beating drum the conflict o er the victory the french in dismay and horror yield and leave the british masters of the field far in the rear a dying warrior lay while from his breast the life blood away attendants bent around to the tide that flowed in torrents from his wounded side with came each panting breath and those proud features wore the hue of death his lips were sealed his beaming eyes dim and strangely quivered every outstretched limb unconscious he seemed of love or hate unconscious now his spirit seemed to the summons that should bid it fly to unseen by human eye he seemed like one already the dead 
5,wild when lo he started â raised his drooping head with dying hand he grasped his blade with eye the battle surveyed heard the triumphant shout they run they run knew that the field was gained the victory won who run he cried with wildly throbbing heart with breast and livid lips apart the french the french â no more that warrior heard it enough for him that single word i die contented and his youthful head fell feebly back the noble soul had fled oh gallant from o er the dark blue sea there comes a wail â a bitter wail for thee thy country her warrior true and brave and yearning love o er thy lowly grave but nothing now may break thy tranquil rest nothing disturb thy calm and quiet breast nor arms nor cannon s roar nor sorrow s wail may ever rouse thee more but when a voice far louder than them all shall bid thee rise thou must obey the call and stand of earthly pride and power before thy judge god shield thee in that hour k from the scene with drooping head and arm another warrior death s seal upon that pallid brow was pressed his icy hand lay on that heaving breast but thoughts of victory lent no soothing to cheer the spirit of the proud he lived to see his followers die he lived to see his troops fly nor longer cared to live but welcomed death and with a smile resigned his fleeting breath patriotic poems his proud s without a sigh or groan and death had claimed the hero for his own the strife was o er the dreadful combat past the echoing hills had found repose at last had done its work on every side and even greedy death was satisfied the sun went down how changed from night how changed his aspect and how changed the sight on which he gazed then his last golden beam on a landscape fair â a quiet scene â where now destruction reared its standard dread o er shattered bodies and o er severed head heap upon heap the pallid victims lay of pain and thirst the prey in anguish rolled upon the bloody ground and still they tore each gaping wound in concert joined cries their teeth and rolled their blood shot eyes with feeble groans they drew each painful breath and with called aloud for death far o er the field in wild confusion rose piles of the ghastly dead â of friends and foes â in death stretched side by side and cold while over all the war clouds rolled in dark dense columns mounted up on high the air all the sky was won and o er each lofty tower the british banner streamed in pride and power where the french eagle once her wings had spread the british lion reared his haughty head and shook the conquered country with his roar the eagle flew in terror from the shore wild with drooping the western main and trembling sought her native france again while england proud and potent took the sway and waved her over canada song of the

5,the letter with a look of pride and joy and the father and the mother said god bless the darling boy the pledge whether the following is a real or a supposed case we know that in this fallen world of ours there have heen many scenes than the one depicted for who hath woe who hath sorrow who hath who hath who hath wounds without cause who of eyes they that long at the wine they that go to seek mixed wine at the last it like a serpent and like an â i all day the snow came silently to earth until the branches of the apple trees bent lower than in autumn their weight of glossy fruit the youthful pines that stood with and wild flowers to speak of summer when all else that laughed air with summer should depart were in white save where some little of deepest timidly looked forth like gentle spring in the arms of stern old winter silence reigned abroad â there was no sun no sky but over all a dense dark mist which hid the blue beyond the had long that day within the village inn and night drew near and found him at his glass then rose the wind and hurled the snow against the window pane come father come a little hand was laid upon the father s arm and into his a pair of pleading eyes looked gently up come father come the begins to blow and mother and watches all alone he not the warning to the bar he gaily turned and cried another glass i the glass was drained and yet another filled â and still the cried come father come the night is cold one thoughtless comrade said and you have far to walk here drink my boy the child pushed back the s hand a glow of indignation cheek and brow â my mother says there s poison in the cup and i will never drink he firmly said the father gave him an smile patted his rounded cheek and his curls then heaved a sigh â while o er his manly face which had been handsome ere the fatal wine it a mournful shadow crept and darkened all his soul come father come this time he listened clasped the little hand and they went forth together in the storm the wind blew fiercely from the north and east and called its forces from the neighboring hills they heard the summons eager to obey and t along in one continuous roar they caught tlie snow new fallen from the earth and a sheet with which to blind the eyes of those two on the frozen waste then night came on dark night came suddenly and hid within its bosom bush and tree and all that stood as to their home the little winding path they trod that was now a path no more yet had his brain been clear as on the his step as firm the father might have found his homeward way but oft the earth seemed his feet and once he fell then himself anew to struggle with the storm how long the way dear father are we almost home at last through teeth that came the words and of dew stole from his anxious eyes and turned to ice drops where they fell and then the father took the patient boy within his arms he him to his breast and tried with steady gaze to pierce the gloom if he might catch a glimpse of friendly lights or of the lamp that burned for liim in his own cottage fed by one who watched and wept and prayed and turned the cottage door upon its frosty hinges till her fair cheek grew purple with the cold he thought of this and anguish and remorse smote heavily but deeper the night and hours that seemed like years to that distracted r passed nearer and nearer to his aching breast he the child â for hope faint within yet with that j burden at his heart he could not quite despair if i have if i am seen in heaven s all searching light black and yet my child is e and for the father s sin he should not die guard him ye angels save him my god thus in the depths of his own soul he prayed and again the little trembling hands and kissed the cheek so cold it spoke of death let me kneel down dear father let me pray for i am weary â i will sleep awhile but ere i sleep dear father let me pray and round his father s neck he his arms and faintly whispered half his evening prayer wretched father man is it the wind that makes thee shiver thus part ii all day the snow came silently to earth until the path before the cottage door was even with the drift on either side no foot disturbed the mass of white b ut the wind began to roar and shriek and night descended with her wing darkening the scene around a pallid face which had been pressed against the window pane for half an hour came forth into the gloom as looks the moon some stormy night when every star is and she alone through clouds forth and keeps her watch so looked tliat wife and mother as she stood upon the threshold gazing down the road with chattering teeth and limbs that with cold imagining she heard in every gust the voice and of the man she loved the hearth was piled with blazing logs that shed a cheerful glow upon the cottage the table spread for three before it stood and yet the bread was all unbroken there â and from the cottage to the garden gate a shivering form went flitting to and fro despair

we shall be justified in concluding that these die und von dr f xiv introduction are no of chance but that taken altogether they afford proof that the was acquainted with the writings of the new testament used them as he thought fit and has woven into his own work numerous passages if not word for word yet preserving the meaning and it according to his indian mode of thought a fact which till now no one has noticed to put this assertion beyond doubt i shall place side by side the most important of these passages in the and the corresponding of the new testament i distinguish three different kinds of passages to which can be from the new testament first such as with more or less of verbal difference agree in sense so that a thought which is clearly christian appears in an indian form of expression these are far the most numerous and indicate the way in which the original was used in general secondly passages in which a peculiar and characteristic expression of the new testament is borrowed word for word though the meaning is sometimes quite changed passages in which thought and expression agree though the former receives from the a meaning suited to indian conception although the influence of the christian may not be considered to extend to the religious and moral ideas not of a christian character â such as are in the present volume â which are found in the indian writers and to affect their originality i regard the question raised by dr as of sufficient interest to induce me to here with the discussion of the subject which appeared in the introduction to my little work and moral sentiments rendered from writers published in which is in the present volume in order if possible to reach a solution of the problem by dr three points must be considered and settled â is the age of the whether supposing its antiquity not to be such as to its originality any christian doctrines could at the date of its composition have been imported into india and in an or written form so as to be accessible to the author introduction if hu mind was open to their reception and bis work when compared with the or doctrines any each to their ideas as to justify the of their being borrowed myself offering any definite opinion on this intricate problem the solution of which depends on the answers to be given to these questions i shall refer the reader to what has been said on the first two points by the different writers quoted further on and myself offer some remarks on the third point in forming an opinion on a question of this we should supposing the allied to be admitted consider first whether the ideas sentiments or figures of speech supposed to be borrowed by the indians from the west are not such as might naturally arise in the 
11,human or at least in the oriental secondly whether cannot be traced at least in in indian writers of such antiquity as to the supposition of foreign influence whether do not so the indian writings as to be and original whether the writings of any other countries known to be independent of christian influences contain ideas or sentiments supposed to be exclusively or peculiarly christian and what probability there is that the of the period in question could have been brought into contact with foreign ideas and whether they would have been and morally open tâ and susceptible of influences i venture to make the following remarks on this there is no doubt a general or perhaps i might say a striking resemblance between the manner in which his own divine nature devotion to his person and sets forth the blessings which will result to his from such worship on the one band and on the other the strain in which die founder of christianity is represented in the and especially in the fourth as speaking of himself and his claims and the which will follow on their faithful recognition at the same time the contains much that is exclusively indian in its character and which finds no in the new testament doctrine xvi introduction some of the in the indian poem also present a resemblance more or less close to some in the bible perhaps the most striking are the of the ix they who devoutly worship me are in me and i in them and xii thy mind upon or in me fix thine understanding on me and thou shalt thereafter dwell in me as compared with john vi he that my flesh and my blood in me and i in him and john f neither pray i for these alone but for them also which believe on me through their word that they all may be one as thou father art in me and i in thee that they also may be in us here however it will be observed that the condition of in the speaker is not the same in all the cases and in particular that the indian work neither the idea of eating his flesh and drinking his blood nor the existence of two divine persons in the some passages occur which in part convey the same or a similar idea thus in il it is said hj we have been in thee and in x this o hath been in thee o son of strength he has no other and in viii wa we gods are in you as if fighting in coats of mail in the and german by dr and himself professor to the words in the last passage the sense of being in anything being closely connected with it to the similar phrases and in the other two he the sense of having a share in which seems to be the meaning in one passage at least vii where the compound occurs in any case close connection is the words here rendered thereafter by in the height m der he here who has and whom he as having on high after this life the words however usually mean after this and k t gives hereafter with this passage dr iii seek those things which are above etc introduction and in viii the says to wm m thou art and we are thine the following are some other remarks which i have to upon dr s â ind ant as above quoted p he ia far from darkness viii p light of lights far from darkness is his name xiii which he with god ia light and in him is no darkness at all john i the words here translated far from darkness would be better rendered by beyond the darkness they are not peculiar to this passage but occur also in the da ii and v the words meaning above or beyond the darkness occur also in i gazing towards the light beyond the darkness we have ascended to the highest the sun a god among the gods in the lines of the the words are immediately preceded hj a the sun coloured beyond the darkness the indian writer had thus no need to borrow this epithet from the bible it may be remarked besides that the verse g viii contains many other of as the supreme deity p but if i were not constantly engaged in these worlds would perish if i did not work my work iii which is compared with my father hitherto and i work john v this is quoted as one of the passages which contain a expression of the new testament with a different application but as the author it the application seems to be nearly the same as he renders the words u these worlds would perish or would sink whereas it appears that the whole verses ff points to the influence exercised by the example of an eminent man on the people around him and leads to the conclusion that the words should be rendered these men would be discouraged or led into error if i did not perform xviii introduction good works as an example for their imitation in r m s the words are c all good people would be destroyed the sentiment expressed in iii is also to be found in il edition see to this volume p line â p dead in me x ye are dead and your life is hid with christ in gk d col il the phrase here rendered dead in me is mad pr it is explained by e as mad having your life gone to me the sense is not obtaining a support for your soul or self without me the followed by undoubtedly means dead ie one whose breath is gone just as i e does but with a word preceding it means gone to thus means gone to or 
11,abiding in the heart the compound before us therefore whose breath to and rests in me it is preceded by having your hearts in me mr as supporting the sense he gives but it is not adopted by or p i who am the highest tray vii p i am the way beginning and end ix the german of the last two words should be rendered origin and dissolution â compared with i am the way no man unto the father but by me john xiv i am the first and the last rev l the word here translated way is in both passages of the this i regard as it is true means going and so no doubt stands for path but here as in many other passages of the indian writings it i should observe however that this is not the sense assigned to in th s translation p where they are rendered these worlds on the authority of and if he is right there would be more between the two passages compared by dr introduction xix certainly the place reached by going resort refuge b explains in the second passage thus â pr a i e the heaven of india and other which are to be attained it is further to be observed that whilst himself as the way the truth and the life in one of the verses referred to calls himself only the abode or resort and in the other the resort the the lord the witness the abode the refuge the mend the source the dissolution the stay the the seed so that in any case the resemblance would be but partial while some of the ideas in the g are foreign to the new testament it is perhaps superfluous to remark that there is found in the no such idea as that should suffer for the sins of mankind repeatedly this of himself john x i f xii â xv â it can scarcely be considered as an approach to such an idea that says of himself in that foolish men despise him in his human form being ignorant of his higher nature as lord of all beings he is in fact described in the ii ff as having been treated with contempt by i la whom he see indian poetry p f and my original iv ff d ed it is also to be remarked as another between the christian and the indian doctrines that while in the fourth gospel christ his with the father john x and speaks of the father as being in him and of himself as being in the father he yet declares himself to be in some sense distinct from him as being the son t as being sent into the world by the father z xii as having received of the father the of having life in himself v and as not doing anything of himself but doing the father a will v whereas in the we find no reference to any similar relation between and any other person in the or in fact any reference to a distinction of persons in the at all he is represented as himself the supreme xx introduction deity in vii â he says of himself i am the and the of the entire universe than me there is nothing higher on me all this universe is woven as gems on a string i am the in water the light in the sun and moon c and in ix he says by me in form this universe is pervaded or spread out all abide in me but i do not abide in them and yet they do not abide in me after hearing s own account of himself says x thou art the supreme the highest essence the eternal divine all two modes of to with are described as follows at the beginning of xii verses those who fixing their minds on me with the faith worship me with constant devotion are esteemed by me the most devoted but i am the goal at which those arrive who their senses maintaining in all circumstances the same dispositions bent upon the good of all creatures worship the indescribable absolute immovable being but the latter those whose minds are fixed on the experience greater difficulty since the goal is hard to be attained by embodied beings here there seems to be no of to the supreme spirit as described in verses and but it appears as if in this passage it were intended to represent the of final by means of devotion to as an easier method of gaining that end by in the interest of simple minded â who were not to the world though they were like king to regard it and all its interests with perfect indifference â a visible object of meditation for the and abstract object of contemplation to which the thoughts of had formerly been directed by in a verse of a previous section king is celebrated in the as having attained perfection by the method of works the system preferred by in the passage of the abstracted in the introduction xxi had said i am easily attained by the steadfast who thinks of me with a soul fixed on me exclusively it thus appears that while the doctrine of regarding hia own nature is his in its from the older of the and many parts of the in the the supreme spirit is neither represented as in a human person nor made the object of passionate devotion the absence of all emotion indeed is regarded as an essential element in that perfection which leads to final from earthly bonds and with the supreme spirit but may not the doctrine of the have arisen naturally and without the of any foreign influence from a of the and popular elements which both existed in the in the hymns of the jt we find devotion and affection to 
11,the gods expressed in a variety of terms which are in the latter part of this volume ff and fl is there as has been asserted by dr indian for anything essentially new in the conception of devotion which was not contained in these expressions and it is scarcely necessary to say that a popular worship and adoration of various must have prevailed all along from the age down to that of among those sections of the people which were inaccessible to abstract speculation and to ideas and might not the and popular have been blended in the minds even of members of the learned class and have found

proceeds to refer thus to the second passage above quoted â in the xii the case of a white king â who because he was devoted to had restored his son to life â is referred to in proof of the possibility of such restoration a christian legend may perhaps form the basis of this story unless we should compare with it the legend of in the m xii ff to whom gave by restoration to life a new son in of a son whom he had lost the story last referred to is told in two places of the according to vii s ff king as a boon from the sage that he should have a son whose nature was such that all that issued from his body was of gold the king s wealth in consequence increased the son was however carried off and killed by robbers who hoped to get gold from his body but were disappointed the king him and is told by that he shall die as many famous kings whom he goes on to to thia subject in the second ot hia ind f where he that s number of c me to india both bj be of whose agency traces still on the bar nd also through high asia â those who from this side being at to the north west of it no colonies are now to be met with there he finds the of thia partly in the fact that this tract ha been

different with the of he then proceeds â although it is d that christian colonies should have been able to maintain in the north western part of india i have nevertheless in vol i indicated from a

who have gone to heaven do not desire to return to earth and that therefore the slain who are in paradise should not be lamented while the lot of the living on the contrary should be a cause of grief tlie tale is repeated in a quite different form in m ff and ff asks the and for a long lived son promises a son but not a long lived one as he says the father in making his request designed that his son should overthrow the god and when entreated to change his decision remains silent tlie king is however assured by the of the story that he himself if called upon after the boy s death would restore him to life verses â a son is accordingly born to however being afraid of him and being a of s doctrine plans the young prince s death and commands his to take the form of a tiger and kill him ff this accordingly takes place when the boy was five years old and was playing in the wood attended by his nurse ff the king comes to the spot and calls to mind who appears and the boy to life ff the views of professor above referred to are discussed by professor in the second volume of his second edition ff he in the belief that some became acquainted with christianity in some country lying to the north of india and brought home some christian doctrines this he considers to be supported a by the name of the white island and the colour of its inhabitants so different from that of the indians by the to these people of the worship of an unseen god while the indians of the same period had images a learned correspondent is of opinion that no such conclusion can be drawn from this story he thinks that s bears about the same to the christians as swift s or the of does introduction of their c by the to them of faith the of which is not an ancient indian i by the value attributed to prayer which is a less important element in indian than in christian rites and by the fact that the they learned is as one only made known to the indians at a late period he holds it as the most likely supposition that was the country where the met with christian professor thinks that the proof drawn from the passage about and his four referred to by see above in favour of the supposition of the presence of christian in india rests on no firm foundation j and believes that this story owes its origin to the other passage in the m about the does not think that any influence was exercised by christian or their on the religious views of the indians because a the christians occupied a very subordinate position in india and were at a distance from the of indian science and religious life because the actually persecuted the christians and e because both the and other indians are opposed to the reception of anything to them by the x e degraded foreigner the only knowledge of christianity which the indians have yet been shown to have possessed during the first three centuries of our era is confined to the meagre acquaintance with it contained in the narrative 
12,of the to which reference has been made does not consider that the doctrines arose from an acquaintance with christianity but thinks that the of the story about the white island employed this see

doctrines this has been done by the introduction of who is said to have gone to the after and and to have received from himself the doctrine is further opposed to the supposition see s l that the indian resulted from an acquaintance with christianity for a the did not a single god but as the highest to whom the others were the had already a highest god in and the of the system had a single highest god in their l making a created being the indian tendency to was based he considers on the character of the which involved an exclusive adoration either of or further does not consider it to hold that the ideas of the regarding prayer and faith were at all influenced by any acquaintance with christianity he is further of opinion that a belief in the of existed three centuries before the christian era an opinion which he on what relates of the indian and thinks that there is no ground for admitting that in the early ages of christianity any christian legends were transferred and applied to professor in a note in the second vol of his ind ff replies to s argument â derived from the account given by regarding the indian â that in the age of that greek author the indians already possessed the conception of of the deity he considers that is wrong in supposing that had in view in his account of the indian and thinks rather that the mentioned in the i i ff is alluded to introduction or that if not he then ma s brother is more likely to be meant as in his preface to uie vol l of dr hall s edition p xii was continues regarded at the period in question as a purely human a character which be bears in the ff the peculiarity of the system of consists considers not in the assumption by a god of an animal or a human form which is common to almost all but â apart from the

admitting even â what does not believe â that this conception was current among the indians before they became acquainted with christianity it was only after this period that it acquired such force as to become formed into a complete system in a paper by professor nd in the indian for january headed allusions to in s the author after the passages on which he as follows i have thus brought together seven passages from a work written in the middle of the second century before christ which show that the stories about and his worship as a god are not so recent as european scholars would make them and to these i ask the attention of those who find in christ a of and in the bible the origin of the and who believe our literature to be merely a later growth had previously referred to these passages in ff of his paper on the vol xiii finished in october but on the uncertain supposition that these go back to s time he does not consider that the application to of the word on which and to which the gives the sense of the supreme spirit means anything more than that he was regarded as a a character between his position as a introduction hero in the story and his with ind iv f in his on

indifferent to other knowledge he appears in the ii where he receives though not a king the present suitable to a person of the highest dignity he appears further as a the friend and adviser of the p possessed of supernatural power and wisdom how he attained this elevation as for the present inexplicable the pilgrimage of some indian to and their discovery there of the worship of christ the son of the divine virgin led to the further development of the worship of and to his exaltation to the dignity of this result was not so much considers due to direct christian influences as to independent leading to a special indian growth this question of the originality or otherwise of the has been treated at length by the in an essay of pages to his english translation of the published at in some of the contents of this introduction are as follows the

derived from and holds that it is as old as the of in he the passages by dr to prove that the from the bible together with some other passages not by him which exhibit a and that they do not bear out his conclusion nor does he admit that the scene in which his glory is derived from the of christ f in ff the author dr s idea that the terms and faith and devotion are borrowed from christianity in p he gives it as his opinion that it is more probable that christianity borrowed from than for details i may refer the reader to the essay itself having these opinions on the question whether the indian writers who lived shortly after the rise of christianity ever acquired any knowledge of that religion and whether their doctrines were influenced by such i may treat the question as being sub however it may be decided it becomes of the less consequence as one of the of an affirmative answer holds as we have seen above that the indians modified very much that which lie considers them to have adopted see the above made p xxvi f from his ind i j and the remarks from hia p quoted above in p but however the question of the obligations of the or of some other parts of the to christianity may be decided the decision can scarcely affect the determination of the and very different question of the originality or otherwise as far as any foreign influences are concerned of the great bulk of the moral and religious sentiments embraced in my collection these sentiments and observations are the natural expression of the and experiences of universal humanity j and the higher and nobler portion of them cannot be regarded as peculiar to introduction christianity the of this view is placed beyond a doubt by the which i have from classical writers it is my impression however that the sentiments of humanity mercy forgiveness and are more natural to the indian than to the greek and roman authors unless perhaps in the case of those of the latter who were influenced by philosophical speculation this tenderness of indian sentiment may possibly have been in part derived from which however itself was of purely indian growth it is also to be remarked that even supposing the comparatively late date of the and any other parts of the many other portions of that great work from which so large a proportion of the collected in the following pages are derived may be older and such as from the age in which they were composed could not have undergone any influence from christianity what then are we to say as to the date of the this cannot at present if it can ever be determined with any certainty the great poem is no doubt in its present form made up of materials from very different periods is of opinion d edition i f that with the exception of pure which have no real connection with the substance of the work we have the ancient story of the before us in its essential elements as it existed in the pre period t e several centuries before christ the subsequent additions he considers to have reference chiefly to the exclusive worship of and the of as an of that divinity p in the article in chambers s which is one of the furnished to that work by the late p the following remarks occur â that this huge composition was not the work of one single individual but a production of successive ages clearly results from the of its contents from the difference of style which its various parts and even from the which disturb its harmony the question is also treated by professor in his introduction of ancient literature ff in ff he tells us that the name of the in some of the is mentioned in the of a ana whom in p he places about the year b c and that his age would therefore if we can rely on our furnish a limit below which the first attempt at a collection of a or ought not to be placed but he adds there is no hope that we shall ever succeed by critical in restoring the to that primitive form and shape in which it may have existed before or at the time of a much has indeed been done by professor who in his indian has pointed out marks by which the modern parts of the can be distinguished from the more ancient in p he in the form in which we now the it shows clear traces that the poets who collected and finished it breathed an intellectual and religious atmosphere very from that in which the heroes of the poem moved the character of the story has throughout been changed and almost by the tendencies of the latest who were clearly up in the strict school of the laws of id a paper published in the th of the journal of the branch of the royal society k g the question regarding the age of the and his investigation by saying p i have thus briefly the principal to 
13,the existence of the from the time of and a â from about the th century ac to the time of t e the th century after christ he had previously said in p of course i do not assert that the poem existed in s time in exactly the same form as we have it now there can be no question that several additions have been subsequently made and it has undergone a good deal of but the main story as we now have it leaving the out of consideration was current long before s time the remarks just quoted afford us but little of the special introduction aid which we require in judging of the age of many of the different parts of the until the poem shall have been subjected to a much closer examination than it has yet received and of which has set the example it must remain uncertain in regard to many portions of its contents to which of the two classes of ancient or modem or to what stage within either they should be assigned i may perhaps hazard the opinion that such passages as that containing the long collection of uttered by in the book â â as interrupting the narrative if not for other reasons â are unlikely to have formed a part of the original work and from their contents the same is probably true of large portions at least of the th and th books the which i have quoted from this great poem are as remarked in the quotation given above from professor s article far from being all in harmony with each other in a work of such great extent no doubt by a series of successive additions from the pens of writers of very different dates a of sentiment was not always to be expected but development in various directions was a natural result perhaps the most distinctly marked are those which relate to the light in which the pretensions of the are regarded in some passages which i have translated in the following pages these pretensions are stated in their most exaggerated form whilst in other the value of birth is as distinctly and moral and religious goodness alone is esteemed as possessing any value this alteration in sentiment is ascribed to the influence of by professor who considers that other principles of the later also were derived from the same source and even writers may have regarded the pretensions differently again the in m l ff and xii ff of which one specimen is see p of the d volume of his work on the this volume bears the title of die und introduction given in no and in p are opposed to the spirit of the better of the poem and are even as observed in p by the supposed or more probably by a subsequent there is a class of men whose ideas are expressed in these verses while they are rejected by men of higher moral feelings fair dealing with enemies is expressly in a x ff and xii ff further we find in the different passages which i have very different sentiments regarding women it is needles to say that this should be no matter of surprise and is easily to be for by the differences in the characters of women and in the experiences of their or i must confess however that my own of the has been very and as above observed much light yet remains to be thrown upon its and by a and more careful study of its contents so much however seems to be already clear that however many of the sentiments and ideas which occur in it may be due to influences wliich can and naturally have acted upon the to its contents there is no reason for to the supposition that christian doctrines may modified any considerable number of its ideas the other works from which i have quoted except the the the c and the b from which some passages have been taken are of much more modem date but the substance of many of the which occur in them is to be found in the older works and the fact that so many sentiments of the latter should have been repeated in the more modem books may afford some proof that they are congenial and natural to the indian mind as this question whether the ideas and doctrines of the indian poem are derived from or have been influenced by the new or the old testament is one of great interest and importance i give below a translation of the latter part of an article by professor of on dr s book which appeared in the for th introduction october followed by some remarks with which professor dr and m have favoured me on the subject of the dependence or independence of indian writers on christian or other foreign sources for any of their ideas professor says â we have not as yet spoken of the object which the book before us has properly in view this is nothing less than to show that all the nobler thoughts in the are derived from christianity or from the revelation it is impossible here to examine dr s process of proof since it is based upon a large number of particular passages according to the judgment of the author of this notice however the proof has not yet been that in the we have a piece of christianity translated into the form of indian to refer to at least some general points of view dr s failure to make use of indian has had first of all for its result that he could not always apprehend the indian thoughts in an indian spirit the immediate introduction of the bible into the explanation of the is therefore at least premature besides the particular passages themselves are with too great confidence by dr as the 
13,sources of the indian thought or expression it cannot be denied that he has actually some surprising parallel passages but the most of the which he has can at the utmost claim our consideration only after it has been proved in another way that the and the bible stand in a near relation to each other if the author should think to rely upon the multitude of the passages which he has quoted it should be recollected that a hundred uncertain prove no more than a single one of the same character has dr noticed that the comparison of the human soul with a team of horses by him in p note from the i with remarkable to the beautiful in s this might be regarded as one of the most interesting examples of accidental correspondence for the rest it is much to be questioned whether professor to whom the author repeatedly appeals introduction shares his for professor s that teachers and doctrines arrived at an early period in india and that in particular the worship of and the legends relative to him were formed under the influence of is very widely different from dr s conviction according to which the of the must hare learnt at least the new testament directly by heart this is the conclusion at which every one would arrive who reads the lists put together in the of â l passages which vary in expression but agree in sense in number ii passages in which a characteristic expression of the new testament occurs in a different sense passages in which sense and expression correspond even the ideas of the christian fathers are supposed not to have been unknown to the poet see e g p note p note p note c so much the more surprising is it when dr himself p note finds it necessary to to the sharp contrast in which christianity and the indian stand to each other in regard to the doctrine of the human soul and when he further p note cannot avoid to the poet an acquaintance though a very acquaintance with christianity it is impossible to combine dr s ideas into one general picture finally as regards the thoughts in which dr traces of the revelation or tradition see e g he should first have whether they can be pointed out in the had he done this he would probably have discovered that the contrary is the case the book before us plainly shows how much the text and explanation of the stand in need of a thorough on the port of scholars who familiar with this branch of study the view of which dr is a representative must be subjected to a closer examination than waa here practicable in the preceding notice reference is made to the of professor on the influence exercised by christianity npon indian religious ideas i am indebted to the kindness of this distinguished with whom i have introduction on the subject of dr s book for an indication of his views regarding it he me to a brief mention of the work in question in a note to an article in his vol ii p where he speaks of dr s remarkable endeavour to point out in the with and to und the new testament and states that although he considers this attempt of dr to be he is not in principle opposed to the idea which that writer but regards it as fully entitled to a fair consideration as the date of the is not at all settled and therefore presents no obstacle to the assumption of christian influences if these can be otherwise proved he adds that he regards s theory that the of the later is essentially a christian doctrine as according well with all that we know already about the the c as regards the age of the professor thinks that it should be borne in mind that in the very passages which treat of the war between the and and which therefore appear to be the oldest parts of that vast collection not only is direct mention made of the and the wars with them see professor s on indian literature p but further that the king appears there as an old friend of the father of see v he that all these passages must be to alexander the great and still continues to regard his calculation that this most original part of the poem was written between the time of alexander and that of â see of ind y p g as the most probable the opinion above referred to of professor is to be found as appears from professor s on the t p note in vol iii of the oriental magazine and is thus referred to in mrs s life the age of this author is there said to be in the second half of the first century of our era introduction in ancient india p â professor notices the resemblance of the doctrines of the to those of some divisions of the early christian schools and hints that the of the ancient systems into popular forms and in particular the vital importance of faith were directly influenced by the of the christian religion i find no express reference to this influence of christianity in professor s sketch of the of the works vol l ff except that he there says that the doctrine of the of to have been an important upon the primitive system of the religion p un the same general subject dr has favoured me with the following expression of his opinion he writes â neither in the nor in later writers have i found any of moral or religious import which could with any probability be referred back to any foreign source in this department the indians have themselves reflected so much and presented their thoughts in such elegant forms that with their riches they might easily supply the

26,rendered above by the words after death there is consciousness of separate individuality is thus explained by the on ii p of text of the in the there is no consciousness of a distinction of this character that i am such a person such a one s son happy is it salt taste some from the middle how is it â salt take some from the other end how is it salt having thus tasted it said u wait upon me s did so and said it the salt continues to exist u replied that reality is here in this body though thou dost not perceive it that it forms the essence of this universe â that is the truth that is the soul that art thou unhappy c since it a consciousness is caused by ignorance and since the science of or divine knowledge utterly ignorance how should such consciousness of arise in one who has acquired knowledge such consciousness of distinctness is inconceivable in a man who has attained to the state of even though he is still in the body how much less can it in one who ia entirely freed from effects and instruments the then s perplexity as arising from the apparent contradiction between having declared that the soul was compact of knowledge and then affirmed it to have no consciousness or knowledge in regard to this doctrine the reader may consult what professor says in his lectures f he there states and yet they did not believe in the of their own self here we see that was certainly not the last and highest goal to which the philosophy or the religion of the indian in the forest looked forward the true self was to remain after it had recovered himself we cease to be what we seemed to be we are what we know ourselves to be c in the m xii however king expresses his doubts in regard to this doctrine thus venerable sir if no one has any consciousness after death of what consequence will ignorance or knowledge be in that case and see most excellent of everything will end in what difference will it then make whether a man is thoughtful or if there is either no connection then with living beings or a connection only with such as perish what certainty can then be entertained or of any future reward v after a discourse of some length beginning verse with the words here neither is the end nor on the other hand is individual existence the end arrives at the conclusion verses ff this being bo what can there be or on the other hand how can any individual be eternal t since all things naturally exist by their cause ignorance just as all rivers when they reach tiie ocean lose their and their names and the larger rivers swallow up the smaller so are beings absorbed such being the case how can there again be any consciousness after death the individual lives being collected from every quarter and absorbed by soul and he who possesses this comprehension of and calmly seeks after the self is not in the fruits of works as the leaf of the when sprinkled with water is not freed from many rigid bonds arising from offspring and when he pleasure and pain then being he reaches the highest state without a subtle body without fear of decay or death he rests with the blessings of the founded upon the authority of the and both and sin having become exhausted and the fruits from them having ceased when they have ascended to the which has no stain or mark they behold it without any attachment to the understanding as a revolving spider when its web is exhausted remains thrown down so when freed the man suffering and as a dashed against a rock just as a deer leaving its old horn or a serpent its skin without regarding them so he suffering or as a bird a tree which is falling into the water flies away indifferent to it so having abandoned pleasure and pain and he the highest state without a subtle body the preceding story

fascinating and romantic but as the subject is not to be treated from a sentimental or an point of view these remarks must yield to considerations of a more practical and commonplace character the

mission putting to sea on may and meeting with seven or eight days of pleasant weather so for the season the ocean somewhat deserving of the that it displayed its prettiest of and tints and sunset effects as we through miles of and had it not been for the occasional sight of and little black divers with the daily fall in the we should not have known of our approach to the north this happy state of affairs did not continue long on reaching a higher latitude where we were beset by hail and furious storms of snow and all the of sea life causing a p in every sense of the term the increased cold as we the north had no perceptible effect for the worse on the health of the ship s company and it is gratifying to state that but few serious cases either or medical l during the entire voyage a happy event undoubtedly owing to the careful measures taken to secure full and to the excellent routine and discipline the is a good sea vessel being tolerably dry in bad weather and her are easy for a small craft at the outset of the however we were placed in the best possible conditions for studying both and the strange phenomena of that tribute of suffering that so many people are obliged to pay to the sea unfortunately so little is known of the nature and origin of this most distressing affection and medical science has done so little to its attacks the wonder is that more extended experiments are not made by medical men in regard to in spite of many theories and that have been advanced to explain the phenomena of this so called disease we know that its causes are purely physical the swinging of the the disturbance of the in the contents of the body â just as the up and down in a â and the consequent of the and system of nerves i a kind of which in different individuals according to peculiarity of structure and experience that no known to the will prevent or cure notwithstanding the of eminent medical authority to the contrary resolute effort of the will and the resort to such as drinks containing an excess of champagne and beer for example and were found to be the most modes of treatment adopted in the numerous cases of this almost evil coming under my observation a portion of the crew suffered from violent of the hand arising doubtless from the combined influences of long confinement on sea diet and unusual conditions this affection was not confined to our vessel alone for it prevailed among the as well the worst cases occurred among men whose history revealed the previous existence of to remedy the condition it was recommended that the entire ship s company e allowed a run ashore as often as practicable and that there be added to the usual a of a supply of which had been laid in among other happily these directions were complied with as far as possible and i had the satisfaction to witness the good results another affection prevailing among the crew was a attended by excessive which i at first suspected to be due to the presence of but subsequent experience showed that temporary could be brought about by the administration of and the application of and water i may mention that my friend dr charles smart u s a who has in the as far as latitude on a says that he has often noticed the foregoing symptoms in connection with among sailors and also among soldiers in who had been living for some time of steamer in the ocean on the army he regards the symptoms to arise from and as the ones that an outbreak of a few cases of return of fever brought about by wet and fatigue and of â which seemed to be the prevailing â

condition of the and indeed of other vessels in tlie service might be greatly improved by covering the berth deck with a of and better might be secured by an arrangement similar to that found on the latest english naval vessels where a passes up through the side of the ship until it opens just beneath the rail on the inside of the and is covered with a blind further advantage especially in the

warmth and comfort but the effect was anything but picturesque as the foot resembled a extremity that some hospital nurse had endeavored to in a beyond the summary obtained from the signal station at saint michael s e are no extended weather observations to report in regard to any fixed i for the reason that the ship seldom remained longer than a few days at a time in any one place and it was o to get any definite information from the natives whose knowledge in this respect does not extend beyond noticing whether the is great or little during the winter as regards the weather during the past season there is a marked contrast when compared to that experienced on the s former voyage the sea was from ice a fact doubtless owing to the preceding mild winter and other causes but the number of fine days was few and a series of and snow storms continued throughout the summer even as late as july the were covered with snow and hail and a bitter cold wind penetrated of steamer in the ocean our winter in opposition to this was the temperature of july when the while the above is true of the weather in the more northern part of the we found it in sound later in the season much than it was at a corresponding date of the previous year in the latter part of june at saint michael s we found the sun almost overpowering although the but p why this should exist between the sensation of heat as experienced by the human body and the actual temperature as revealed by the we are not prepared to say all that we know from writers on the subject is that the sensations of heat and cold are relative and not absolute in different among the in for instance the opposite condition is often noticed a disagreeable sensation of cold not indicated by the being one of the experiences of in that part of the world the cold is keen and penetrating with the standing at but p an excellent distinction is that which these phenomena as physical cold and cold the former indicating that revealed by the the latter that not indicated by instruments many travellers have noticed this relative sensation of cold as well as the and even a certain degree of comfort with which they can expose themselves to a low temperature which would be attended by serious in a more southern dr relates that in he went swimming in a pool of water on the of an and the captain of a new has frequently gone swimming off the coast of taking advantage of one of these warm days i took a plunge into the icy water with no such motive however as that of nor did i like have the after it on the contrary a swim of no great discomfort was followed by a reaction the actual rise of temperature that follows upon in a cold atmosphere or upon first entering into a cold bath is not one of the least curious phenomena of the function of the nor is the busy activity of the and the of the food within the canal which accounts for the source of the heat of such animals as and the birds a subject to be passed by by what physical and laws can we explain this this action of the in the of energy sufficient to supply bodily heat to such animals as the seal and the whale and enable them by remarkable to withstand the extreme cold of the does the of the whale and of the duck enable them to combine a greater quantity of with and thereby act as a source of heat or is the function of the liver the chief source by what means does the energy yielding material become change l into actual energy f does the nervous system acting as a force like the in a steam engine remove or to the of into energy or do all the internal work of the animal all the mechanical labor of the internal muscular with their accompanying and the labor of the nervous and other a certain amount of heat and thus account for the special function of the foregoing with many others suggested themselves on hearing the statements of and hunters with reference to the sensation produced by the blood while handling the bodies of recently killed animals and it occurred to me that a series of observations something after the manner of the experiments of dr in connection with the 
35,fish commission but having for their object the investigation of the of animal heat by the marine would prove interesting and a scientific in addition to their novelty while ample opportunities occurred to make these experiments yet it is to be regretted that the only available instrument a was unfortunately broken early in the season the experiments were to say the least so rough and that any record of them would be of questionable value another question in connection with the cold is whether a in this region does not render one more susceptible to and of the organs on returning to more temperate the history of who have spent time in our comparatively moderate climate shows bow they have suffered in this respect and have been known to prevail of in the ocean the healthy of

cause of this illness on board the on her return to san in october and at a time too when the glorious climate of appeared at its best no such cause existed yet of the most violent kind prevailed generally among a previously healthy crew before dropping the question it may be asked whether the effects of climate were not apparent in some of the sensations as experience by myself and others something more than must account for some of them for instance when climbing a steep cliff with no sound to interrupt except the scream of wild sea birds or ascending a in side amid scenery the most desolate that can well be conceived and in a stillness so great that the are audible how is it that certain trains of the most and absurd thoughts a in the mind f on such an occasion why should the strains from wedding be continually running through one s what gives birth to the floating succession of ideas regarding the delights of dinners and why does the of the midnight sun cause one to forget like whether one has or not while through ice and fog often within sight of a coast that is and why should one dream of the laughing aspect of tropical vegetation and of swinging in a in a garden through which the summer wind bears the fragrance of and why should a diet of pork and beans cause a man during a series of nights to dream of dinners and at other times in his dreams to take part in a feast among various phenomena witnessed during the were and fog bows which were of common occurrence off island and toward the latter part of our stay in the when the sun was no longer in

baron relates that a pistol fired near some cliffs on the river is echoed a hundred times the great distance to which small sounds are sometimes is also worthy of record the first time this clearness of the atmosphere came under observation was at saint where a conversation carried on at an incredible distance could be distinctly heard amid the grim silence and desolation of heretofore island at a time too when the air was for that latitude i distinctly heard our a small man with a voice of no great volume giving orders two miles away while laughter and sounds of the voice when any one spoke above the ordinary tone were heard with such amazing distinctness as to suggest communication where the conditions were so favorable to the reflection of waves it was natural to expect the occurrence of a phenomenon an echo at sea such as i once noticed in a fog off the banks while crossing the atlantic in a french steamer whose fog whistle was echoed in a surprising manner but at no time was it observed that the state of the atmosphere overhead or the of fog banks gave rise to anything like an echo although as a rule no very marked differences in the deep sea and surface were observed yet a few of the noticed are deserving of mention for instance near herald island on july the temperature at the bottom was o and â a few days later off the coast miles to the southward it measured â while

ones in the more southern part of compared with which the great of the is a mere that the amount of is much less in the higher of the pacific but the finding of and rock and other evidences of former as well as of coal which says is the sun s rays in form and also the remains of the along with luxuriant tropical or semi tropical vegetation would imply the existence at a remote period of a different condition a change in which has been brought about according to the explanation of the in long la of time through the change in the of the earth s in combination with the of the and the movement of the whether a climate existed in former days the to on vegetable food as suggested by professor or whether the in his personal while to overcome the influence of climate was detained in his present position by the sudden it is impossible to say sir charles seems to account satisfactorily not only for the of these animals in the northern parts of and america but for the permanent masses of ice known as his explanation is as follows this snow is commonly blown over the edges of steep cliffs so as to form an inclined hundreds of feet high and when a torrents rush from the land and throw down from the top of the cliff soil and gravel this new soil soon becomes covered with vegetation and the foundation of snow from the rays of the sun water occasionally into the and of the snow but as soon as it it serves the more to the mass into compact ice it may sometimes happen that cattle in a valley at the base of such cliffs on the borders of a river may be overwhelmed by drift snow and at length in solid ice and then transported toward the region or a herd of returning from their summer pastures in the north may have been surprised while crossing a stream by the sudden of the waters in the course of the summer we fell in

men who should never have been in the first place there also came under notice a case of in it would have been desirable to try large ot â a medicine not among the stores â consequently the patient was by treatment and there occurred two deaths one each from consumption and one man of the escaped crew of the bark daniel which was crushed in the ice on being rescued two weeks of exposure terror and starvation was completely insane but subsequently regained his reason it seems that the act of ship in the not only taxes all the resources of but the situation to bringing about mental one of the oldest and most experienced tells me that he has seen men from an abandoned ship so lose their wit as to cry like children sit helpless on the ice and refuse to move until the most measures were taken to force them another told me that some years ago having to retreat from his crushed ship across the ice two of his crew becoming finally drowned themselves and the insane of the party is fresh in the minds of every one the rescued crew of the were on the verge of starvation when picked up and among the nine taken on board the there prevailed for some weeks a peculiar disturbance of the organs by a tongue and a sense of and pain in the region but the demands for medical services were more urgent among the inhabitants of several remote places where the touched at and at saint michael s the most northern station of the commercial company and one of the few with a physician e op in the and securely in a land locked harbor by like a dreary picture of snowy desolation we the air chilly and apparently to give a heal the inhabitants called it mild weather an from which a large portion of the native population of the island had died prevailed in the little village off which we and the only physician of the place being also ill the sick were without medical advice or attendance during the few days of our stay every assistance in our power was rendered the and we hope that our advent among them was the means of several that otherwise would have taken place diseases peculiar to the population observation of the disease in question showed marked of the blood cough with pain and great depression both physical and in fact the latter symptom was the most characteristic and it seemed impossible to impart the least ray of hope to a patient who had made up his mind to die from the of his attack the disease was very rapid in its course and considering the gravity of these assembled phenomena there was but little of the fever that usually the main symptom calling for relief seemed to be the marked to combat which the administration of and milk were to with effects it may be mentioned that the administration of to these natives is attended with the happiest results the attending physician at me that most of the he has to treat among them being of an character lie invariably gives the effect of which he says is almost it is very much to be regretted that time and opportunity forbade a in one of these cases for among the different and varied forms under which presents itself and this type from any i have heretofore seen it is not at all incredible that there may have been something about its morbid what connection there may have been between the outbreak of the and the prevailing and influences it is impossible to say but the well known relations of conditions to certain diseases would lead one to infer that the previous occurrence of several earthquake or what is more probable a mild winter with an unusual amount of may have been the cause not to mention the interminable diet of and whale of the his fondness for and his inability to resist slight causes of depression so far as it is possible to ascertain the disease seems to have been confined almost exclusively to the native population at the only sufferer not a native was from the island of the also prevailed at saint paul s cook s and prince william sound a singular coincidence connected with the outbreak l its appearance at these places immediately or soon alter the arrival of the first vessel in port this circumstance so impressed itself on the native mind as to give rise to a general and strong belief in the of the disease it is not at all unlikely that sickness of the foregoing character has occurred from time to time among the we have a mention of at least one outbreak where it is stated that during a few days of unusually warm weather an of made its appearance at one of the adjacent islands attacking about fifty of the natives the same authority reports the of fever at cook s among a white population who lived on a bluff several hundred feet high in houses exposed to a strong breeze directly from the the states that the disease might have been contracted elsewhere but happening after a sea voyage of forty days and in persons previously in good health he attributes it to locality in a with mr whose knowledge of this part of him to give an intelligent opinion he informed me that for many miles around the bluff in question the land is low and but he thinks it is not and the opinion of dr a russian surgeon who says that in summer the weather of cook s is warm and clear in winter the falls 
36,to w below and fog are rare and the atmosphere is clear and healthy these observations the doctor adds are supported by admiral medical and journal vol iy of steamer in the ocean another observer assistant john u s a in a report to the war office speaking of the climate of a part of in tlie same latitude as remarks it might naturally be that in such a climate acute and acute would be very common but such is not the case during a tour of nearly fifteen months i have seen but one case of typical acute and not a single case of or cases of sub acute however and pains and of a few days duration are very frequent is not uncommon and forms a large of the cases of disease even among the native indians â â â f cases of sickness not occur in which there is a general condition of the system without disease a condition which is due to the influences of almost continuous wet and cool and cloudy weather a monotonous diet in which fresh fruits and vegetables play an insignificant part the almost entire absence of out door amusements and the want of opportunities for sufficient exercise in the open air the cannot be dismissed without some further historical mention for which by the way i am largely indebted to mr who has obtained his information from original sources not generally accessible to the ordinary reader from to no special diseases existed in the russian colonies exclusive of and at the end of a fever l by a broke out from which forty two deaths occurred at and twenty five at no were in the colonies at that time except those accompanying the ships of the company firom st it subsequently two were established in one at of forty beds and one at of ten beds and in the company had in its service three eleven five and two and two from to a most fatal in the form of an fever j at the same disease in prevailed at and the three hundred natives having died the further says that eat was owing to loss of courage and refusal to take medicine in his historical review of the colonies says that the prevailing diseases among the native population of are consumption and they being indebted to the for the of the latter he also the occurrence of in at and the missionary establishment at bay at the first mentioned place the disease occurred principally among children in there were sixty four cases of at of which nine died and in an fever like yellow fever occurred it was believed to have been imported by a ship which had come around the globe from russia the er does not appear to have been excessive for out of three hundred and forty one cases there were but thirteen deaths the same year there was also an of three hundred and ninety eight cases having occurred at and with sixty deaths in attacked both and children causing eighty one deaths in the whole colonies from a report of the russian american company on the condition of new and other posts from may to may it is learned that for and the first third of and those of pre years there existed both in the number and character of the cases a marked difference that was very gratifying the mean daily number of in the new hospital was ten persons besides the fact is worthy of attention that and

cleanliness are reported to have been generally obeyed was generally carried out and almost all the children were except at mission where the natives refused to adopt this method of protection but it is stated that this obstinacy may be overcome by time or accidental circumstances such as the of an a disease called the black appeared at and the a joining islands in from which the herald of august reports the following deaths to july of that year wood island eagle harbor total the natives of the islands being better house l than those on the islands appear of late to have better as regards health than their more southern neighbors tlie wonder is though after visiting these islands that so little sickness exists among a population most of whom live but a few hundred yards away from the of thousands of in all stages of on the island of saint paul for instance 
36,where the climate is as and disagreeable as possible the of the that are yearly are left to decay in the open air in the immediate vicinity of the village and the is anything but pleasant one night

the marine for in addition to the millions of live to be seen hauled up on the we walked through the green the remains of thousands of slain years ago occasionally sinking over our ankles in a substance resembling picked our way through the scattered of last year s seal and witnessed the remains of the killed but yesterday and of the killed the day before from information furnished by special agent it is learned that the diseases are of a and character but the returns of a late year show three deaths each from and since out of a population of about the increase has been but slight the and deaths having about balanced each other the per thousand being nearly three times greater than that among more civilized under more favorable conditions and the women as a rule being it is hardly reasonable to look for any decided increase in the population except under changed and more favorable conditions mr george the genial author of tent life in has kindly furnished a translation of the chapter from s history of the islands relative to diseases and their treatment from which the following notes are taken it appears that in the early days of the russian occupation the had some crude notions of human which they acquired from the of the dead bodies of their slaves and they also had considerable knowledge of medicine and the practice of which being and suppressed by the is now entirely lost among the diseases most common to them were a skin disease known as and fever â the latter called common because no one escaped it â and consumption of two kinds generally considered the first variety was simply a decay of the lungs attended by such symptoms as cough of blood and of breath the second proceeding from decay of the liver was accompanied by of the and rapid they were also acquainted with another disease which they called the inward disease and disease were formerly unknown to them of steamer in the ocean â their principal consisted in patience and strict diet the patient being allowed only a le and two of water in the twenty dangerous wounds were treated by prolonged as they considered food and drink dangerous for the patient and creating a liquid in the wound which caused and even death the writer states that this method of treatment is still pursued and thinks that even now it many from death accidental wounds from fox traps were quite the iron teeth usually taking effect in or near the knee joint at out of forty or fifty cases but two are known to have died in wounds aside from diet they used for and keeping alive the fat of fishes and various land animals especially fat from the head of the fox over deep wounds they burnt teeth reduced to powder and applied a fresh mouse skin every day and they treated with various and or by made of roots other external diseases they hardly treated at all except by the universal diet and patience in they employed of bitter and guarded the patient carefully from the external air were also used in consumption of the first kind but if the proved troublesome the patient was submitted further to the operation of in both kinds of consumption the doctors supposed the bad symptoms to proceed from bad blood or a or spirit the operation just mentioned was performed by thrusting stone on both sides immediately under the ribs and was done by the most only because it required accurate knowledge of the internal parts and of just how much of the spirit to let out as there was danger of letting it all out and thus sending the patient to the other world the operation also used as a remedy for internal disease was considered the most approved treatment for and expressed themselves as having received decided benefit in critical conditions was resorted to as the last and sole remedy it was also used in many other diseases for example in diseases of the eyes where the skin was pricked between the eyes or on the of the neck in fact this operation was done on all parts of the body and n instance was known of an having submitted to it forty times various parts of his body having been the were men famous for their skill and imparted their knowledge to the best beloved of their children or for this reason the art is of late become almost lost common bleeding fi om the arm and leg was employed to reduce large and correct morbid conditions of the blood also to combat or weakness headache and loss of appetite for roots and diet were employed or the root of the another treatment in internal diseases generally resorted to by old women consisted in a sort of of the belly while the patient was lying on his back it was used principally against pains and high praise from the men who have experienced the treatment effects of the principal vices among these people who are generally mild and seem to bo a fondness for games of chance and an craving for drinks â an appetite which by the way two seasons of personal observation and experience in the convince me is something of a necessity the taste however seems to be an acquired one by the for i saw a man at island to whom the taste was foreign and on 
36,both brandy and he made a face and them out with evident disgust late authorities testify strongly in favor of the benefit to be derived from moderate indulgence in drink during an in over a of the evidence taken by the committee appointed to inquire into the of the provision in the way of food and medical comforts furnished to the search expedition we learn that sir edward attributed the greatest effect to beer and dr r x fleet surgeon alert says it is the opinion of all the men he has read about who spoke about beer in the regions dr believes beer decidedly and it should be given sir george says are no better off than others as regards captain says he would as soon take a man of temperate habits on an expedition as an the two total of his suffered severely and he himself felt better after he took to drinking his rum sir l says there is no advantage in mr alexander y of steamer in the ocean gray that there is ho advantage in health in on board while dr a who accompanied excess but says he to be of great use in small and moderate quantities further mention may be made to professor and lieutenant who in undertook a journey from their winter quarters in in latitude â north and were away sixty six days during the whole journey there was no though the party had no lime the diet consisted of salt pork butter coffee in abundance and a little spirits daily all returned in excellent health comparison may be made between the alert of the expedition aboard which prevailed notwithstanding the careful daily administration of lime and h m s assistance in in the assistance there was beer on board while the alert had no such advantage no prevailed on board the former ship captain speaking of the of in any future expedition in high says that the causes may be reduced to a by varying the diet with milk butter eggs beer and wine he also in regard to the and completeness of that former had the means of beer on board while the expedition had no such advantage moreover says that captain hall of the who died of was a and was much annoyed at seeing others drink whatever conclusions may be fi om the foregoing it is evident that there is an absolute of opinion both among and medical officers of late in regard to the judicious use of it only remains to add that personal ence and observation convince that there is an indescribable something in the atmosphere hat produces what is called the northern craving for drink even among persons who care nothing for it in temperate being of habits i would not for the world say an to favor but facts warrant in to the good effects of when served out to the crew after unusual fatigue and exposure and i know of no place circumstance or condition under which such as beer and are more or more valuable from a point of view than when taken at meals during an voyage taking advantage of this northern craving for drink have of late years been in the habit of supplying the most in exchange for small quantities of which the gives his some captured specimens of these articles bearing the respective of bay pain and water with a view to the proved on examination to be nothing but cheap of a highly nature to which a little matter had been added as i am to give the least encouragement to being rather an advocate of i cannot help thinking that it would be a step in the right direction and one productive of good if instead of the present measures the fur companies were allowed to sell small quantities of beer and in addition to their value as their use would be eminently better for the natives from a moral point of view than the present use of a vile native made from sugar and flour both of which articles the have a right to dispose of in unlimited to the alleged introduction of is said to be due the famine and excessive among the natives of saint island one thousand of whom it is estimated have died in the last three years several visits to this island revealed the fact that it is fast becoming the first village at which we landed was entirely deserted at a second not a living being was to be seen but in and around the houses were counted fifty four dead bodies all many laid on the adjacent hills while others md died in bed where they still remained a third village which must have been a very old settlement judging from the thousands of strewn in every direction and from the character of the kitchen was also it was a in every sense of the word a great many dead were found here laid out of doors and in one house we found sixteen bodies among these remains were those of several children a fact which tended to remove previous suspicions of on the part of the at these villages was made a fine collection of and other for the institution finally we visited at the extremity of the island a settlement where

shaved after the manner of s pictures of in the middle ages were in for and the chief of the village refused to sell us a few skins 
37,unless we gave him liquor in exchange this too while the i remaining dog looking wistfully up into his face seemed to be a living warning not to try as a remedy the hair of the dog that had bitten the village to attribute the late cause of death among these entirely to admits of some doubt it seems impossible for them owing to lack of means to have procured enough drink to last more than a few days or at least during the short stay of any trading vessel that may have arrived then again it is probable that some influence was the main if we may rely upon the statement of a captain who visited the island during the time so many were dying he tells me that the disease was what he calls or black tongue admitting the of sickness of this kind among an and people starvation must follow as an inevitable and result similar conditions having prevailed among the of bay and east cape many of whom have died in the last few years it would perhaps be nearer the truth to say that the in question was due to the combined influences of sickness and starvation effects of climate at saint michael s almost under the circle i found that troubles and the constitutional effects of prevailed among the small population to an alarming extent here also as in most every northern place we touched at the wicked thirst for rum exercised a influence the are long and cold with high winds and and a great deal of snow the falls to â and the winter previously to our coming was so severe that owing to the great and long continued cold dogs and wild are reported to have frozen to death the accompanying from the records of the signal office give a more detailed account of the weather summary july to end of jane july september october november december january february march april may june s t â to a e c i s range i s i i i â i â â i i â â â â s s a a i at i north north north south south north north south south n e north r op and snow i â n c c c s o a at s o s e â â s general remarks july â cold and damp rain or fog nearly every day â cold and rainy â winter commenced the last of the month remarkably early october â almost a continuous series of all the month november â series of the last of the month december â and the last half of month ending abruptly in severely cold weather station saint january â remarkably high the first of month long continued cold weather with high winds the last february a continuous series of accompanied by snow march â large snow fall during the month but the as in february prevented april â very cold unusually fine weather toward the last of month but low still â winter continued unbroken until the th when it became suddenly warm and the water fowl began arriving op steamer in the ocean jo o o ih m m jo u â i s jo if ai lo jo q ic a xv s a ci a s a is s s s v â â w i â j a a s s i i i â i o on â ra â â n i np k i o ox d d o b i â b s h â n j h v a fi a q â â g â â s g g â i o â m h o to t i s s t s s â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â â m â â â â â d â â w â s it â i l si â â â o â j q ci o o m s s w t ei l s s r t s s o o ci si o co c m â â â â â â â s s s â s t j s g s g â â r r s s s â i â â â s g s s â iâ r i i i i r â â k es c â â k w h a â os i c â i ra i v s ran a b â â â a m â a j â s h s â ii s s p â o t â j â x s â â â t r â â i râ i v v â â â ci t â â n â â v t â hair saint of m the ocean in addition to the frequent of the organs and affections of the canal are quite common the latter are principally due to the stomach after a long fast and from this cause is so frequent that it is no uncommon thing to find an suffering for several days from all the remorse of a guilty stomach the women too are at times violently hysterical and in this respect do not differ much from their more civilized sisters affections of the eye diseases of the eye and its are quite numerous and among them i noticed several cases of of the and of the and of and in its form and of the are common along with and and it is not at all unlikely that a might the in describing the diseases he might observe among these ous eye however i but two cases of total blindness one in a man at saint island and another at saint michael s in a native from the interior mr whose duties as agent have afforded him great for observing 
37,the interior population me that blindness is almost universal among the older people most of whom get blind on reaching the age of fifty this blindness common also to the lower animals was once observed by liim in a bear at prince william sound the l ear with others was seen approaching his party on the beach and the singular actions of this particular bear attention from the uncertain way in which he walked and was pushed about by the noses of the other bears it was out and shot when an examination showed the previous existence of total blindness which of course accounted for the odd movements of the animal these eye affections are not caused by smoke as has been supposed they ai e mostly the result of snow blindness in which the sensibility of the end organs the rods and is diminished or exhausted by the prolonged illumination from the constant sunlight and the glare from broad of brightly glistening snow the of the atmosphere the and condition of the blood brought about by bad feeding and the may likewise be mentioned as causes it may not be from the subject to an of mr surgeon to sir edward s second expedition who has noticed in the what he believed to be a resembling that which the eyes of some animals the peculiarity he i out as common to many individuals of and consists in the inner comer of the eye being covered by a of the adjacent loose skin this fold is lightly stretched over the edges of the eyelids covering the which in is exposed and forms as it were a third lid of shape this was l to be very remarkable in childhood less so toward the age and then frequently disappearing altogether the proportion in which it existed in grown up persons being small compared with that observed among the young an interesting question in this connection is the form of the of the and rods in the of the it is known that in animals the habits of which are such as and the are wholly wanting and rods alone are present so a may have occurred in the eye of the in this particular as one of the results of his conflict with his circumstances but this is mere speculation and the observation of mr when viewed in the light of more recent knowledge would seem to be nothing more nor less than a defect to the of the skin at the root of the nose and of the folds on a level with the inner of the eye known as which often with the development of the bones of the nose and is by an operation or the application of to the muscles of the face although from the for eye medicine were quite frequent yet i was unable to find out much regarding the means taken by them to treat or prevent eye diseases in the quaint old book of a missionary who spent twenty five years among the is an account of an operation that he has seen perform for removing a from philosophical

pair of era of french manufacture which he carried carefully protected in a skin bag hung around his neck another pair was in possession of a man at cape who showed how they were useful to him in were found to be quite troublesome at saint how strange that the busy of these little insects recalling the for a pour in a french should one s ears at a spot so far north beyond the domain of the ordinary globe and unknown to the little are more widely distributed than the race or the to both of whom they cause great annoyance during the short summer frail as they are in body they have reached as far north as man has penetrated having been found by the expedition and unlike other insects they seem to have no relations to the external conditions by which they are surrounded being in fact and having no province not only are they to any limited or definite area their distribution in time is with if not to man as their remains have been found in the beds of the lower white and an instance is even recorded of their material for wit at lieutenant s expense who was by these people the big mr a who visited northern to study the birds writes but there is one great to this charming and that is the reason why it is so frequented by birds â the of mo life without a veil i believe would be perfectly i was obliged to wear thick leather gloves and on many occasions when shooting if i was too long in taking aim i had to shake the barrel to get the 
37,off and then take another aim quickly before they lighted again otherwise i could not see the bird at all as encountered by us surpassed anything i have ever seen in new for instance where it is said they collect at times in such clouds around village church as to be mistaken for smoke and cause an alarm of fire although they were worse than anything that i ever experienced at such places as island the new station or on the they differ from the southern insect in several respects in the first place they ai e more and more and have not so much and activity in consequence of which they are unable to get out of the way quickly and can easily be killed almost by the handful but they seem to be just as and persistent as their southern owing to their excessive annoyance at times it was found to be almost impossible to use the instruments in taking observations when the position of a spot on shore was to be determined on one occasion at a desolate spot on the top of island about feet above the sea level we found an station which had been established by parties from english ships in search of sir john and near it was a notice telling something about a bottle buried so many feet to the north curiosity of course prompted to get it by all means but the coming in such actually caused the search to be abandoned many of the men of the s crew were seriously by their and on exposed

37,miles distant some the happening to stop in at bay i inquired of a native remarkable for his s english and way of putting things whether my patient had got well to which he replied yes small well i learned subsequently from a vessel on board which this man had made a visit at saint bay that he had entirely recovered from his wound but still labored under the delusion that his life had been attempted by the captain of the one case of of a wound of the foregoing description does not prove much to be sure and it is hardly necessary to advocate a subject that has been the occasion of much discussion but it does seem that the treatment which has been and by such masters as de john de par of and others has its virtues notwithstanding a different and assumption put before the public in a late official publication wounds seem to heal uncommonly well in the a fact doubtless owing to the highly condition of the atmosphere and the absence of disease and dust it is noticeable both in man and animals at king s island i saw a whale s in which had taken place after a probably caused by a lance and i have also seen a bear with several ribs which had been by a ball that had previously passed through the skull a of a taken from the cliff in sound likewise showed after a several extraordinary from wounds more extensive in character than anything of the kind i have ever seen in

wounds were well occasional wounds usually the result of accident are also met with among the at saint bay i saw an old man who had been struck by a ball which entered the left side of his face just

whether the rule relative to the destruction of weak or i am unable to say however that may be i can recall but a single instance in which there was observed anything approaching to and that was a girl with a skin diseases principally of the and varieties were to prevail a fact not to be wondered at since they are just the diseases the medical man would expect to see developed in subjects among whom are recognized the conditions most favorable to op steamer the ocean â their origin the existence of the and even diseases along with personal must necessarily result in such of the skin as and all of which i saw among the although affections of the were quite common especially in children i noticed but one case of which leads me to doubt the statement of several medical men to the effect that wearing fur caps is one of the causes of loss of the hair if this were true every ought to be as bald as the palm of the hand it is also doubtless true that the numerous and and troubles are only internal of the previously mentioned when the was along the coast in june and july not a man on board had a cold yet nearly all the natives we met with were suffering from and the same was observed by our party who went up the coast and lieutenant me that and complaints were the principal ones noticed by him notwithstanding mr s mention of a in an atmosphere of â it is indeed questionable whether

38,his infirmity was a source of merriment to his companions i treated one patient for and another for i saw also two cases of one each of and of with symptoms both at point one of and i know of at least three deaths from to what cause a late authority would the existence of these diseases i am unable to say but enough has been seen to convince that nervous diseases are not confined to civilized as many persons believe and indeed a distinguished medical author who sees in a form of nervous might after observing and its results be in possession of enough material for a new chapter in his work on that subject on the northern inhabitants but it is from an point of view that the coming under observation proved most interesting the term may be held to include all the population living on the islands the islands of sea and the shores both of asia and america north of about latitude in this latitude on the american coast the points that difference the north american indian from the are distinctly marked it cannot however be said that the marks of distinction are so plain between the american and the so called of the coast i have been unable to see anything more in the way of distinction than exists between englishmen and for instance or between and indeed it may be said that much of the confusion and absurdity of found in literature may be traced to a tendency to see where few or none exist to the observant man of travel who has given the matter any attention it seems that the most sensible is that of the ancient writers who divide humanity into three races namely white yellow and black adopted this division and the best contemporary british authority dr also makes three groups although he somewhat in details firom in accordance with the of the may be spoken of as of essentially and habits who have not yet emerged from the hunting and fishing stage op steamer is the ocean physical appearances their physical appearance and having been already described by others it is to mention them here except incidentally and by way of noting a few that seem to have been heretofore overlooked or slightly touched upon by other writers although as a rule they are of short build about five feet seven inches yet occasional exceptions were met with among the natives of sound many of whom were tall and of commanding appearance at a man was seen who measured six feet six inches in height this from the conventional type as usually described in the books may have been caused by with an inland tribe of larger men from the interior of who come to the coast every summer for purposes of trade the complexion rarely a true white but rather that of a with a healthy blush each cheek is often of a yellow and sometimes quite black as i have seen in several instances at was the broad and flat face and the small nose without exception in the vicinity of east cape the extremity of asia a few were seen having hebrew noses and a of such a type as to excite the attention and comment of the sailors our crew others were noticed having a cast of features and looked like while others resembled several old men i know in washington however the e in these people was so pronounced that our boys on meeting for the first time took them for on the other hand the were objects of great and constant curiosity to the who doubtless took them for a fact not to be wondered at since there is such a in the shape of the eyes the complexion and hair in regard to the latter it may be remarked that scarcely anything on board the excited greater wonder and merriment among the than the presence of several persons whom professor would in his group because of their fiery red hair the structure and arrangement of the hair having lately been proposed as a race

whether any existed between and the in the vicinity of straits i caused several boys employed as servants on board the to talk on numerous occasions to the natives both of the american and but in every instance they were unable to understand the and assured me that they could not detect a single word that bore any resemblance to words in their own language the study of the peculiarities which distinguish the population around straits offers an path in a new field but it is doubtful whether the results except to like cardinal or of the type would be at all with the efforts expended in this direction since it is asserted that the human voice is incapable of more than twenty distinct sounds therefore whatever there may be in the particular words of different languages are of no value although these may be the views of many persons not only in regard to the tongue but in regard to in general the matter a wonderful fascination for more minds much has been said about the of language among the â some asserting that it is such as to allow mutual intercourse everywhere â but instances warrant us in concluding that considerable exist in their if not in the construction for instance take two words that one hears oftener than any others on the coast they say na a word meaning good all right c on the coast ma ah while a collected during lieutenant s expedition gives the word for good the first two of these words are so characteristic of the tribes on the respective shores above the straits that a better than any yet given to them by writers on the subject would be for the people on the american side and for those on the coast these names by which they know each other are in general use among the and were adopted by one on board the again on the american coast am a plenty while on the coast it is ee tee tee means needles in in it is in the latter place when asking for tobacco they say te ba while the say that a number of exists around straits is apparent to the most superficial observer the difference in the language becomes apparent after leaving sound the we took from saint michael s could only with difficulty understand the natives at point while at saint island and on the side he could understand nothing at all at east cape we saw natives who though apparently alike did not understand one another s language i saw the same thing at cape prince of wales the western extremity of the new world whither a number of from the had come to trade doubtless there is a community of origin in the tongue and these verbal may be owing to the want of written records to give to the language since languages resemble living by being in a state of continual change be that as it may we know that this people has imported a number of words from coming in contact with another language just as the french have into their speech le i le high life le chase le club c â words that have no in french â so the has appropriated from the words which as verbal expressions of his are undoubtedly better than anything in his own tongue one of these is by and by which he uses with the same that a does his le in this instance the words express the of steamer is the ocean state of development and habits of thought â one the lazy of the es i and the other the to morrow ot the who has indulged that so far that his nation has become one of yesterday the change of the language brought about by its coming in contact with another forms an important element in its history and has been mentioned by the older writers also by who reports a change in the language of the

when he in bay every day about noon that personage was in the habit of taking his and usually said to the come joe let s take our like most of his countrymen joe was not slow to learn the meaning of the word and to this day the firm hold has on the language is only by the thirst for the which the name among the the word um is common for rum while em means water even words brought by from the south sea islands have obtained a footing such as for food a word in use and for no or not any they also call their babies pick a which to many persons will suggest the spanish word or the southern negro for baby the phrase is the usual in begging food for their children an having sold us a said it would be good eating and one windy day we were the and an seeing its empty condition when pulled on to the beach said wind plenty fish the with which some of these fellows speak a mixture of pigeon english and s is quite astonishing and suggests the whether their results from the of the english or whether it is an evidence of their it seems how a people we are accustomed to look upon as ignorant and can learn to talk english with a certain degree of and from the short intercourse held once a year with a few passing ships how many in san 
39,for instance learn anything of or german from fr the how many wharf rats or in new york learn anything of these languages from similar intercourse or for that matter we may ask how many new york have acquired even the smallest of french from boarding the of the g n from a few examples it will be seen that the usage followed by the in its variations rests on the of the radical syllable and upon the of the different intended to the primitive sense of this root that is to say upon the principle of languages or two instances may suffice to show the character of the language is o me j ship o me steamer ome and this mechanical structure reaches its climax in steam which they call o me pick a for snow and ice in their various forms there are also many words which show further the structure of the language â a t contrary to that primitive condition of speech where there are no to indicate the relations of the words to each other it will not do to omit from this â a word trade or sale and one most commonly heard among these people when they wish to say a thing is bad they use a and when is meant they say pe the latter word also expresses general for instance on looking into several houses a native us meaning that the people are away or not at is cold and is hot persons fond of tracing may find in fire a to the latin or the english and from un gi big huge the transition down to is easy those who see a sort of relation to each other of and the in physical characters may infer from a term of equivalent to and used in addressing little children that the inhabitants within the circle have something of the isle about them but no they are not irish for when they are about to leave the ship or any other place for their houses they say to hum consequently they are op steamer in the ocean i do not wish to be thought frivolous in my notions regarding the noble science of but when one considers the changes that language is constantly the inability of the human voice to articulate more than twenty distinct sounds and the wonderful amount of ingenious learning that has been wasted by on trifling subjects one is disposed to associate many of their with the savage picture writing on the giant and the old wind mill at attempts to trace or discover the origin of races through supposed do not possess the advantage of certainty afforded by the study of the means by which individuals of the race supply the continuous demands of the body with the necessary to maintain life and health everybody has heard of the seal bear and whale in connection with and doubtless the of most persons would revolt at the idea of eating these animals the taste for by the way is merely a matter of early education or individual preference for there is no good reason why they should not be just as to the northern appetite as pig sheep and beef are to the inhabitants of temperate as food they renew the the parts and restore the functions of the frame his existence and produce the same animal contentment and joy as the more civilized of the white man s table there are more things than bear or duck yet i know many persons to whom olive oil and de are more a tray full of hot seal a bowl of blood and fish are not very inviting or to ordinary mortals yet they have their in the dish of some farmers who eat a preparation of pig s known as and in the blood and cheese of the oil and whale are not very dainty dishes yet consider how many families on pork and on the mess table of the fur company s establishment at saint paul island seal meat is a daily article of consumption and from personal experience i can testify as to its although it reminded one of indifferent beef rather hair seal and bear were on different occasions tried at the mess on board the but everybody duck and the preference it is not so very long since that whale was a favorite article of diet in england and holland and still to my personal knowledge use the tried oil in cooking for instance in cakes for which they say it answers the purpose as well as the finest while others breakfast on whale and potatoes prepared after the manner of balls the whale i have tasted is rather eating yet it appears to be highly judging from the well nourished look of natives who have lived on it and the air of greasy abundance and happy contentment that an village just after the capture of a whale being ashore one day with our pilot we met a native woman whom he recognized as a former acquaintance and on remarking to her that she had picked up in flesh since he last saw her she replied that she had been living on whale all the winter which explained her it not be supposed however that the whale seal and constitute the entire food supply of the there is scarcely any more delicacy than the tongue of which is very dainty and there is one peculiarity about its flesh â in order to have it in perfection it must be eaten very soon after being killed the sooner the better for it in flavor the longer it is kept indeed the not wait for the animal heat to leave the as they eat the brains and hot and smoking while our enthusiasm did not extend this far we dined occasionally on fresh from a mountain lake

41,t g smith r br angel island our stay on the one point of that we touched was far too short to admit of making anything like as full a collection of the plants of so interesting a region as desirable we found the rock formation where we landed and for some distance along the coast to the eastward and westward to be a close clay slate freely into thin with here and there a few compact masses that rise above the general surface where it is exposed along the shore and kept bare of vegetation and soil by the action of the ocean ice and heavy snow the rock presents a surface about as black as coal without even a moss or to its sombre gloom but when this dreary barrier is passed the surface features of the country in general are found to be finely and smooth valleys wide as compared with their depth back from the shore to a range of mountains that appear blue in the distance and round hills with their side curves finely drawn touching and in beautiful groups while scarce a single rock pile is seen or sheer walled bluff to break the general the soil has evidently been derived mostly from the though a few wasting were observed containing of and granite which doubtless were brought from the mountains of the interior by that have recently vanished â so recently that the outlines and hollows and of the mountains have not as yet suffered post to mar their characters the banks of the river at the mouth of which we landed presented a striking contrast as to vegetation to that of any other stream we had seen in the regions the vegetation of steamer in the ocean was not wholly absent but the and of which it is elsewhere composed are about as feebly developed as possible and instead of forming a continuous covering they occur in small separate leaving the ground between them raw and bare as that of a newly field the plants both on the v west grounds and the slopes and as far as seen were in the same severely repressed condition and as planted in an inch or two in with about from one to three feet of naked soil between them some portions of the coast however farther south presented a hue as seen from the ship at a distance of eight or ten miles owing no doubt to vegetation growing under less conditions from an area of about half a square mile the following plants were collected l af l hook l â l l l hook f l t t l g l t r fir r fir l smith birds of

missing vessels which were lost the same season that the entered the ice through the courtesy of the secretary of the treasury i was taken on board and accompanied throughout the remainder of the season od june we left saint and crossed sea to saint island and bay on the coast thence along this coast through the straits and in the to the vicinity of s winter quarters where we took on board a party which had been left there earlier in the season to search the coast in that district thence we returned again to saint island and to saint after remaining here a short time we returned to the touching at all the islands in straits and during the remainder of the summer visited in succession the entire coast line from straits to point including sound and on the shore from the straits to north cape we also along the edge of the ice pack landing upon herald and islands on september we passed through straits bound south and after remaining some time at in the islands the vessel for a voyage to san we left october homeward bound the observations on which the present paper is based were made both during the just detailed and in addition ai the results of observations made by myself during over four years residence at saint and carried on in various directions from that point in addition have used information obtained from various reports which have been issued regarding the region in question so far as the limited time at my disposal would allow the species given for the coast and the islands of sea are almost or quite a complete list of the birds found there but the species mentioned upon the coast form only a small of those in that region this is mainly due to the little that is known concerning that region and the of its literature the waters lying between and europe on the and america on the have been visited by so many accompanying the various exploring and other that the at least has become pretty well known this is certainly true as regards the distinction of most of the species though the life histories of many undoubtedly yet require the patient of some enthusiastic student ready to face the discomfort and often misery by such work in regions leaving this well trodden field however where is the who is prepared to state just what is found at other portions or on other of this great frozen ocean f the reply is for as yet no one has been able to do more than to touch at some remote comers of the coast or a vessel s may have pressed into the shifting ice pack a short distance only to be or else caught and held in an grasp favorable opportunities of the writer in the unknown region of sea and the adjoining portion of the ocean to the north have been detailed in the present 
41,paper with such other information as could be obtained from other sources as we visited all parts of the basin lying to the south of the solid and between on the east and south straits and part of the southern limit and the same portion of and island forming with the ice pack the western border within this area visiting all the shores named among which as specially may be mentioned herald and islands respecting which the only knowledge existing was that two bodies of land were known to lie there one of which in fact was previously considered almost till the work of the of steamer in the ocean and the has defined it farther work will undoubtedly add other species to the list and the range of others but it is thought the present paper will give a very good idea of the bird life of the regions visited having the continent of america on the one side and asia on the other it might be anticipated that we should secure specially rich results from the of two yet although this is true to a certain extent there are reasons to prevent the very marked exhibition of this the first is the of the region within the limits inhabited by a and in consequence frequented by many species of wide distribution the next is the of the two barren coast lines and islands offering but small to land birds while the sea birds as usual are species common to extended the usually low but rolling coast country a monotonous grass grown plain varied by or moss covered slopes or wind swept hills back far into the interior are the only variations to the general level here and there a few pieces of break the cold gray of the beach while clusters of native huts or tents lend a passing interest to the cheerless coast thus offering but slight for birds as might well be expected the former region north of straits is entirely and south of straits in sea the water birds may be divided into two groups those the deep water surrounding the fur seal and strait islands and the adjoining coast for the first group and the shallow water species along the shore from the mouth of the river to the vicinity of straits the former group the and allied species also the and s and the second group such species as the goose the and many of the fresh and water ducks this distinction of the two shores holds also to a certain extent north of straits these two shores having there somewhat the same relationship i have just mentioned there is also a difference still more striking to be noted between the species the sea of straits and those to the south north of the straits the are very rare while south throughout the islands over all the other islands of sea except along its eastern border including even the islands in straits they swarm in the greatest abundance while the presence in sea of several other si including and not found north of the straits makes the difference still more striking beyond these differences however it is difficult to divide the region into any well marked districts though along some parts of the coast the breeding water fowl fill the with life yet the rocky islands of sea are the places about which birds exist in the greatest s and as baron d well remarks in his account of the s voyage it is not the larger inhabitants of the regions such as the whale bear and seal which first attract the s attention but the innumerable flocks of birds that swarm around the traveller during the long summer day of the north and this is striking about any of the islands which birds the and â seek as breeding places the islands of straits resemble enormous about which the birds swarm in countless numbers filling the air with their swiftly moving forms in every direction and the waters are covered with them all about the islands while every point and place where can be obtained is taken possession of by them for breeding places although herald island is almost perpetually surrounded by the ice yet we found it with and as were also some of the on island still to the westward on some of the islands visited by the crew on their retreat towards the coast this was also found to be the case as mr me and they found there in extreme abundance although the islands were surrounded by an almost unbroken ice pack for the benefit of visiting this region in future i will mention a few where certain species of considerable interest may be obtained the emperor goose is quite abundant on the portion of saint island the low flat portion of the island by the islands of strait are all of them resorted to by the and least and the islands in particular are frequented by of us the ocean of them the summer season along the coast of from just north of straits to wherever the shore is low and bordered by or shallow river mouths occur the s and the king in great numbers according to the emperor goose also visits this coast at we found s in excessive abundance during our stay there as detailed in the following pages the coast from icy to point is also frequented by the king in great abundance the nest in large numbers upon a small rocky just oft island at the head of the sound and also upon the cliff s the northern shore of sound in sea especially those at and s is found rather commonly upon the rivers flowing into the head of sound especially along the some small rocky in the middle of pass near in the islands are the breeding places of the beautiful little and th line of from to the middle 
41,of the is the great breeding ground of the emperor from the northern border of the north to bay the among the water and where the shore is flat and north of saint however this species is rare in its greatest abundance between saint and the month the principal sources from which information has been derived in addition to my own observations have been and s list of birds in the transactions of the academy of for and dr of the islands in s condition of affairs in treasury department the seasons of upon the two shores of sea are usually somewhat the ice remaining longer in spring ui on the coast than it does on the shore and the reverse in autumn when the ice fr om the forces its way through strait and fills the western i of this sea for some distance before ice to form on the east coast on shore we have the reverse and in the spring of when we left saint the last of june the hills were covered with green and and were to show their summer foliage while numerous northern flowers were already in blossom only a rare patch of snow was to be seen here and there on the distant and summer was apparently at hand when we reached the coast however winter still appeared in force and the snow reached from the tops of the highest hills to the water s edge in immense banks and although many places where the snow or wind had opportunity to exert its influence showed the bare covered rocks but the vegetation was extremely backward only just to start in fact this however is accounted for from the fact that the waters of sea are deeper and far colder than those of the eastern shore in summer where the shallow water and great amount of warm fresh water brought down by the numerous rivers flowing into the sea change the temperature very rapidly and at the same time rapidly affect the surrounding atmosphere on the coast on the contrary the ice is swept away by the strong currents which flow north and in spring ing with it ice leaving the coast free from the latter but at the same time surrounding the shores with water at an icy temperature which falls but little throughout the summer the basin like character of sound as also of sound in the aid in giving them a much climate than their northern would indicate the coast of sea from the mouth north to strait is broken occasionally by rugged cliffs but as a rule is low and and covered with grass and with i where the various species of fr water fowl breed along the beach is strewn great quantities of which comes from the but trees occur only along a small portion of the coast extending from the vicinity of north around the coast to near where the are found in some places within a few yards of tide water from this point north not a tree approaches within miles of the coast line at the head of sound a few may be seen on the sides of distant mountains and beyond this the country has the peculiarly barren appearance at the head of the sound a si of tall grass grows in considerable abundance but leaving this sound to the north the coast becomes rf of in the ocean more and more barren from icy north it is a flat or slightly rolling monotonous of at bay on the shore are low hills or mountains rising to feet or e almost sheer from the bay in many places and made up of enormous masses of rock down the sides of which the crumbling of and off make the slopes difficult to about here the attractions for the birds are very small and but few species except water fowl are found on the north towards strait uie coast is somewhat but only at east cape the point of do we find it rising again to a rugged peak thence again along the northern coast the shore gradually becomes lower until it finally the low barren character of the nor does this last appear much more inviting to land birds than does the harsh of the broken and districts the islands of sea as are most islands frequented by sea birds in the north are enormous masses of rock apparently forced up out of the water with almost sides affording innumerable and wherein the birds find shelter and places for their young but with only a slight amount of vegetation and much more witli cold and icy storms at all seasons than they are with clear skies or warm days in conclusion i have only to express my thanks for the rendered first to general w b chief signal officer and to the secretary of the treasury through whose kind permission and co operation i was enabled to accompany the and also to professor s f and mr b of the institution for aid in the preparation of this r m rt e w signal u s a washington may owing to the of the author and

42,gone h ex v of steamer in the ocean aud the the presence of this si in my list is owing entirely to the of s as this bird by mr if s bird was one of these as the imperfect description may be interpreted to affirm it occurs there merely as a for since the original record not a specimen has been obtained at or elsewhere on the islands by any of the numerous who have visited them the description is so vague and imperfect as given by that absolute is impossible and from the position of the original locality the chances are equally as favorable for h to occur as for the dwarf w a rich the american robin the breeding limit of this bird is to the wooded part of the interior but it occurs as a straggling on the coast of sound and straits and a wind bound to the seal islands it is present as a summer resident on as shown by skins brought me by the no doubt it is a thence to asia or land it also visits the shores of sound in the course of its but i do not know of its anywhere near tide water on this coast it is a pleasant experience for one in a far off region like this to come across the familiar forms known in other days the sight of this bird its the houses on a frosty spring morning in may carries one s mind back from scenery to the the hum of bees and such other pleasant sounds and sights of nature as go to make up a beautiful spring day in lower one however the strain of the blue bird and the cheerless surroundings soon bring the stern reality too closely home the birds too seem impressed with the gloomy surroundings and i have never heard them utter their notes during the time of their visits to the sea coast in the wooded interior however they regain their spirits and rear their young even north of the circle and here their cheering notes the wooded river courses during the long summer days in striking contrast to the silence of a few months earlier when a hush made the shadows of the forests a fitting haunt for the wolf and there is no record of the occurrence of the robin in asia that i have found although as before mentioned it undoubtedly is a casual to that region found a single bird wind bound upon the seal islands beyond which there is no record of its occurrence on any of the islands in sea the varied this handsome bird equals the robin in its northern range in and quite a number of skins have been brought me from the northern shore of sound and from the sound region the have assured me of its range considerably beyond this district and found it on the river within the circle where he tells us it arrives very soon after the robin and the yellow it like the robin prefers to nest in the wooded country but unlike the latter it nests at times in the close to the shore of and sounds it is unknown from the islands and shore of sea i have not had the pleasure of studying the life habits of this bird so have nothing to add in this particular but may say that its habits during the breeding season are but little known very few having had opportunity to study its op steamer is the ocean water the american water the year the sparkling streams which descend in a series of from the of the mountains on the islands the cheerful presence and strange habits of this odd little bird the silent and otherwise lifeless and their steep slopes it the wild of this part of the north pacific and sea and is found farther north even on streams flowing into the ocean this half is found about open spots on streams flowing into the head of and sounds where it the of the harsh regardless of the intense cold prevailing for weeks at a time it busily for its food in the icy waters of the swiftly running streams by whose banks with pines and it its young in summer it is unknown whether this or its closely allied relatives is found in land but neither form is found on the islands of sea except in the chain nor were any seen at bay or cape where however the conditions are scarcely favorable for their presence stone the blue the presence of this oddly marked here is owing solely to the occurrence of several specimens at saint michael s sound where several were taken by dr in june the various authorities who have written on the habits of the either as seen in northern europe or agree in giving it rare powers of song especially in the notes of other birds so varied and peculiar are its in this respect that we can but regret that its presence on american shores is due to mere accident the bird though quite distinct in several characteristics especially of color and pattern of body is closely allied to as it possesses the peculiar distribution of color on tail feathers almost precisely as in this later and other marks of resemblance i do not know of its occurrence in although its summer distribution is and it has been found on the lower and in various parts of middle the stone chat the wheat ear although long known as a rather common summer resident in the corner of america and in has but recently been found in where mr was the first to find it he obtained a number of specimens in the middle region since which time dr t h has found it not uncommon on the coast from sound to cape and the writer has taken it in the fall and spring 
42,on the shores of sound at saint michael s and a native brought a skin of one of these birds on board the at king island the summer during one of our visits there this list of shows that the bird is to be considered a somewhat regular to some parts if not all of northern it is very in its occurrence however and where quite common one season may not be found at all the next in the summer of dr found the bird not uncommon in the range just given whereas in the summer of visited the same shore in the and failed to find a single individual although keeping a sharp watch for birds wherever we strangely enough this bird has not been taken anywhere in eastern so that its presence in most be op steamer in the ocean supposed to result from itâ passage westward along the northern shore of america from and its adjoining evidently entering northern and perhaps asia from europe by way of the passage old world ever s flocks of this small bird came during the middle of june and settled on the at her winter quarters of the straits this was before the ground was free from snow and the birds appeared to be much exhausted bias s the first american specimen of this was taken by the of the western union telegraph expedition at saint michael s sound in since then no others have been secured until the three specimens i had the good fortune to obtain at the same locality during my residence at that place its appears to be very irregular as it was found only in two seasons out of four during which i kept a sharp and had native searching for them but obtained and saw only the examples mentioned it has never been taken on the shore of the region covered by this paper but further towards middle it is known to be common extending its summer range to the vicinity of the circle passing south through eastern and central asia in its in the region of lake it is a common as well as further east in how gen its range in is can only be determined when the numerous problems of that country are solved by the work of some â the long an irregular visitor to the shore of sea mainly about and sounds where it is not a rare bird in the fall and at times also in the spring but it is never resident here owing to the lack of suitable shelter e sharp the though to be accounted a species by right of general distribution and of discovery yet this little makes its home among the and paper forests of northern and like the preceding makes occasional excursions to the adjoining and comes familiarly about the houses where it the gloomy opening of the long cheerless winter or breaks into the monotony of the silent frosty days later in the season although mr identified the original american specimens of this bird as typical a more careful examination of a much larger series made by myself shows that it is really to the much and somewhat larger eastern form described in s birds of europe and to which all american specimens should be referred the this bird is the third and last of a band of active cheerful wood whose busy notes and amusing motions while playing at as they in merry troops through the wood op in the ocean lands of the interior holding their own against the winter with its cold and render them the most interesting of the winter inhabitants of northern forests their odd and seeming importance render them noticeable and attractive wherever one goes like it s relatives a few of the more adventurous of this species also pay flying visits to the sea shore where for a short time they about searching the of the log houses climbing about the fences and making themselves thoroughly at home for a short season and then themselves to more suitable quarters again is the this sturdy representative of the common winter of the eastern united states makes its permanent home on the storm beaten and fur seal islands here in spite of weather and the harsh cheerless form assumed by nature on all sides this plain but interesting passes its life all about snow hills or rugged rock strewn cliffs and steep mountain slopes rise against a cloud hidden sky masses of and rain dash down the slopes and sending sheets of spray across the water and driving all else to seek shelter yet this bird holds its own on some partly sheltered slope or grassy flat and if spring be at hand its clear notes may be heard breaking forth during a lull in the storm as the hardy holds by a firm grasp upon some small bush beaten back and forth in the wind or perhaps from some rock the are still with snow in many places when he has already chosen a partner and is deep in the mysteries of family life in autumn he is found as before but less musical as he about the grassy and slopes generally in pairs so that it may be possible he is for life what its habits are during winter i cannot say but so brave a heart in so small a body that bids its owner endure this long cheerless season with its weeks of raging over the mountains aiid through the narrow valleys commands

influence upon their inhabitants is not alone by the peculiar character of their bird life but also in their people as well the language and customs of the latter having their peculiarities as

one of these birds on the island of the of the in the spring of s and one of the most remarkable facts in connection with the history of this species is the fact that a specimen has lately been received at the national museum obtained by mr l in southern where it was obtained in the early winter of thus introducing it as a member of the of north america it is a common and pretty well known bird in from eastern its life history however still remains to be worked out the accompanying plate represents it in the act of darting at an insect in the characteristic manner of this and allied birds the specimen of this bird which i obtained june at bay is an male in spring of which the following is a description back nearly uniform changing on upper tail to with an wash on edges of feathers all but two outer tail feathers black the two outer feathers white each having a band of black from base along the edge of inner web which runs out towards the end of the feathers an inch

the sea coast until its young are and are on their way south this takes place during the first half of august at which time these birds are quite numerous for one or two weeks especially along the shore of sound they are not known to occur on the adjoining shore of nor on any of the islands in s sea i the yellow a common summer resident in every and willow patch along the american and more numerous on the shores of and sounds than elsewhere owing mainly to the abundance of its favorite shelter on these shores its familiar notes and bright render it one of the most attractive summer it is one of the few species of this group extending its range within the circle and has perhaps the prettiest of its kind reaching this high latitude in america op in the gray the yellow occurs as an occasional bat not rare along the american shore perhaps most numerous along the shores of sound it is however a species and makes but very short stops along the coast bat to more congenial in the interior where it its young in the it hastily seeks its more southern haunts and rarely along the bare coast of the north as do some of its relatives the black like the yellow this is a rather scarce bird and is found along the shore of sound merely as a spring and fall it also occurs upon the shores of sound at the same season like other small birds it the vicinity of houses during its passage where it apparently finds the best grounds the small garden spot close to the kitchen at saint michael s seems to be the great and point of attraction for such of these small species as pass that way in spring and fall like some of the other small birds mentioned this is a common interior species it is unknown on the islands and shore of the sea n the small common about the shores of sound during the fall which continues during the month of august although not numerous every season yet from three to a may be taken about the muddy spots in the immediate vicinity of the houses at saint michael s it has not been taken on any of the islands in sea these birds breed in the islands of the lower in great abundance as well as in some of the more favorable along the coast of sound as high up at least as sound their clear rich notes rise from the dense of or in their 
43,favorite haunts in spring the river banks with their wild full tones and dividing the musical honors with the larger fox colored m the yellow in companionship with the yellow this pretty little bird makes its summer home among the patches along the coast especially from the mouth north to sound both this and the species just mentioned extend their summer haunts even to the of the circle both make in the winter to and central america where they and catch flies with the stay and fly of the tropical forests and after a season of and plenty they themselves over the thousands of miles intervening and arrive a merry restless party at their grounds early in june or the last of may they are unknown beyond the and are more in the interior than on the coast the the northern is a very rare to the coast of sea and except at the mouth of the and along the shores of and sounds its occurrence is very unusual in the places mentioned it mast be as rare the mouth of the is apparently the point of most frequent occurrence while elsewhere it is a mere y i an i ir i of a k t i c j hi f v v t t i â â it a i i â â f â m b o â i till t â v â â r ik i j â nm i â â â â â â â i r u v ii i i ii a m â â â â â â â v â â â â j j r â it u i iv i â j â â â i mt j â â â ot n j ii l i i i â as r â t l v o j u i i â i â â â â â m â i i i in â ir c â â â f ih t r m ih i f k j at â â â â â â â â â â â â mr r â j â i t ml i i t â â i â â t i v i it r v t have h ij lt r tl â â â â â t r u â â r â u fl â i u t tr v ar i t j i t t o v b â â â j t â y â i h v d s i â â â i â i l â u i h r the end w j vâ r â â â â i â in i â l showing thâ i â i ii k j t â t h u th â â t â â v j i r m i h y m i s li â t â u â â â â f m v m v h i t arc â â i â â t â i f a u ii â â it â il iâ the â i h v u f j i i â rt i t f v i hi â to th i i â s of ih â i â â â â i f â i j i l â â â i â m la l in im il â n ij t l ii â u m ii v ma t â t r a w â iti â â â li j â â â n i ii t â â â â v â â u â u tt â l w v w i i r u r â â i i f v â â â â j â â ti si â â â â â â u r â i m â y â iâ â is r li i s r o w ful â â â tall i â â â i r â â â op in the the ab the last boat came off from island aud the captain began to prepare for getting clear from the ice that the strong tide was about us with too much force for safety a sailor came up to me in a manner and held out a dried specimen of this bird which he said he had picked up on the and wished to know if i cared for it as might be supposed the was taken in hand and is among the secured during the of the by the aid of it came safely to washington and mr has carefully it in the accompanying plate it has been represented as a fragment of drift wood frozen in the ice with the shores of island in the distance the latter being from sketches taken by myself as we were leaving that place i may refer to the fact that we found fragments of drift wood not only upon this island but in the water about it as several who have seen the drawing have suppose l that the perch must necessarily have been introduced solely by a flight of the artist s imagination this is strictly an bird and its occurrence here upon the far above the tide mark shows that it must have reached here alive probably during some storm and died subsequently of starvation or exposure although the bird was obtained the i th of august yet it is a young of the year in its first of which the following is a description the crown and upper part of the back is slightly dull or chestnut back lighter toward where it is and brown with dark bars the upper tail are or brown with dark near the end and tipped with the feathers of crown and back are edged slightly with showing the the wings are brown with color of the back extending over

seventy of an inch br the swallow one of the most pleasant sights that meet the s eye on landing at saint michael s is the large number of common barn which make their homes about the buildings these birds extend their range to the shores of sea and the ocean their cheerful and graceful motions as they circle and glide in flight about the small collection of log houses recall scenes of a far different character than those which fill the eye at this place here they nest in deserted native houses or under the of the few or log houses and in some instances seek the shelter of rocky and hidden spots on the faces of the cliffs as was seen on the north shore of sound where two nests were found placed far inside of a deep extending into a rocky cliff reaching out into the sea the nests were in close upon a rocky shelf while below them the waves dashed back and forth spray within a few inches of the nests in the islands the swallow is scarce and is said not to occur h ex op steamer in the ocean west of at this latter place its is governed largely by the character of the season a pleasant spring brings them to nest the village while an season prevents a single one from making its appearance the without question to this species as there is nothing else to which it can be referred at as before remarked in some seasons not a swallow is seen at again they are common but thus â ar the in that region have revealed no si of swallow except this which visits this chain of islands the white swallow the present bird occurs quite commonly along the shores of sound during pleasant days the last of may and with the main flight of the it back and forth through the and over the bare but is rarely found in the after a very short stay it leaves for the wooded country in the interior or on the lower parts of the larger streams where it in august it is again seen like various other species straggling along the coast it haunts the vicinity of at this season and may be seen generally n companionship with its cousin the barn swallow for a day or two but rarely remains until the latter starts in its southern i find no record of either this or the preceding extending its range to the coast nor are they known to my knowledge on any of the islands in the straits region the pine an extremely rare to the shore of sea about the head of sound however where forests reach the shore they are not uncommon here as elsewhere in the wooded country it is resident for a discussion of the of this bird i must refer those interested to the more general work i am preparing on the birds of the territory of as lack of space taking up the subject here wiu the an excessively rare species on the shores of sea i know of its occurrence there in but a single instance this was a specimen taken at saint michael s in winter by mr it is of excessive in the region the saint michael s specimen is identical with others obtained at and in the surrounding region which appear to average considerably smaller than the birds of the interior and eastern portion of the continent its occurrence to the north of the can be looked upon as very exceptional the white winged although this species is seen much more frequently on the coast than the former yet it is also a rare bird there except where as about the head of sound the forest of the interior approaches the coast in the interior however this is one of the commonest and most familiar birds and is one of the few hardy species which the in this region during this latter season they may be found moving in small parties through the tree tops or in scattered pairs during the summer attending to the duties of and their young neither this nor the preceding species is known to occur upon any of the islands of sea or upon any part of the shore this might be anticipated from a knowledge of the character of these portions of the region in question op in the ocean the rosy along the entire chain of islands from on the east to and on the west and including saint s and the seal islands on the north this bird is to be one of the most frequent species the delicately blended and with the lovely wash over nearly all the body renders it the richest in color and most attractive species in this region in addition to being the of limited of it is also the giant among its relatives as well it may be to the harsh climate where it has made its home much to the writer s regret he made special effort to find this bird daring both his visits to a hasty glimpse of a single individual flitting along the rugged face of a cliff near the shore in may was the only one seen nearly every 
43,other who has visited this locality has secured specimens and records it as one of the commonest birds even the long harsh winter is not able to make these elegant seek a climate but amid the whirling and desolate scenes of these forbidding islands they make their permanent home in summer among the long and other plants this bird is to be found rendering pleasant the scenes where in winter it alone breaks the dull cheerless monotony it is totally unknown on the of either continent but has near relatives on the american shores and it appears to be a form strictly limited to this peculiar chain of islands although it on the islands it is only known as a summer resident to the north on the seal and saint s islands the white bed all along the coast of sea on the shore from the of north to point as well as upon the islands in s strait and across to the adjoining shore of asia this is perhaps the most abundant of all the land birds their nests re placed indifferently in bushes and of grass or a hole in a piece of drift wood on the barren shore serves as a building site this and the following species in many instances so that it is to separate them accurately my reasons for keeping the two forms separate are given in full in a complete list of the birds of the territory now in preparation over all the of america europe and asia as well as in we find both forms of this handsome little bird giving animation to many of the otherwise lonely and barren spots in summer he is usually engaged in his one or two of dull young and preparing them for the trying experiences they will necessarily face a few months later when the sun draws his short bow across the southern sky and long frosty nights make the very earth crack under the lowering temperature at this season the stars seem each to hang from the by an invisible cord and twinkle clear and bright overhead the sharp of the white fox alone breaks the intense stillness a white frosty fog hangs in the air â the chilled breath of nature â which falls silently to the ground in the lovely crystal of northern in the north a pale arch moves its mysterious and the bosom of the earth silent and chill under its white mantle looks dreary and sad after such a night the sun seems to creep reluctantly above the horizon as though to face the bitter cold the smoke rises slowly and heavily in the fixed atmosphere and warm rooms are doubly appreciated soon small troops of these little red come silently about the houses their feathers puffed out and looking gloomy enough as they search silently among the dead weeds for food an hour or two later they catch the fuller rays of the sun and become more cheerful and busily about though they are far from showing the character which becomes them so well and which later in the season they reveal under the brightening rays of the sun in early spring time towards the last of march and first of april then indeed we learn the true worth of our happy companions they come flitting about the houses on all sides examining the bare spots on the ground searching the old weeds and fences clinging to the and even coming to the window whence they peer in making op in the themselves at home and a hearty welcome for their cheering presence the breast is now a blossom pink and the crown shining scarlet how this bird came to bear these colors is told in one of the indian which is deemed of sufficient interest to relate and after the manner of the tales of our childhood it begins very long ago the whole of mankind were living in cheerless obscurity endless night hid the face of the world and men were without the power of making a fire as all the fire of the world was in the possession of a ferocious bear living in a far off country to the north this bear guarded his charge with vigilance and so was his appearance that no man dared attempt to obtain any of the precious substance while the poor indians were over their misfortunes the bed which at that time was a plain little wood dressed in ordinary dull brown heard their â for in those days men and beasts understood one another â and his heart was touched he prepared himself for a long journey and set out toward the lodge of the cruel bear after many adventures on the long road which he traversed between his starting point and the object of his journey he at length reached the place and by a stole a living from the perpetual fire which glowed close under the breast of the savage guardian and flew away with it in his the glow of the coal was reflected from his breast and crown while his forehead became slightly burned far away he flew and finally arrived safely at the home of mankind and was received with great rejoicing he gave the fire to the thankful people and told them to guard it well and as he did so they noticed the rich glow on his breast and brow and said kind bird wear forever that beautiful mark as a of what you have done for us and to this day the bed wears this in proof of the legend as all may see and mankind has ever since had fire the common this like the preceding bird is found along the entire shore line of sea with the exception of the seal islands and a portion of the chain it in abundance wherever found but is especially numerous along the shore fix m to sound and wherever we 
44,landed from the win like the preceding this bird was also found the former however appears to be the form but the two the same breeding range in this portion of their thus undoubtedly arguing for the distinctness of the two species we found it with the preceding at east cape point and at nearly every place where we landed in winter they band together in flocks and seek the sheltered toward the interior where in and on sheltered hill sides they are found on every hand during mild her they make excursions to the coast and more exposed portions of the country ready to disappear at the approach of an un change some of them like the preceding remain to winter along the sea coast but only a small proportion of the number which is found in summer many doubtless to more southern as they are nowhere found so abundant at this season as during summer although not mentioned by as at his winter quarters yet this bird is known to exist throughout the range of the entire of both and many of the adjacent rendering it certain that it is found in that portion of as well as elsewhere on herald and islands none of them were seen owing doubtless to the scanty vegetation on these barren islands not affording requisite shelter and hospitality to tempt them to cross the icy sea and remain on these forbidding shores the in the north the range and abundance of this species in summer is to a great extent to that of the succeeding species along the more rugged parts of the coast on rocky and barren islands and the bare and desolate shores of the ocean wherever have gone they have found these birds before them the desolate hill tops of saint island op is the ocean tiie bare weather worn sides of the bay and east cape the rocky wind swept islands in strait as well as the lonely shores of herald and islands and the strewn along the north coast of asia and all appear to be chosen as the favorite summer homes of this bird when we landed at any of these places we were certain to be greeted by the clear sharp note of the snow which be running busily a out searching for food or about from place to place its sharply contrasted black and white quickly the eye and usually the first sign of life on the mountain sides at bay its mellow note was heard on june uttering the long clear and rather hard song full of a wild and melody fitted to the surroundings this song consists of four or five dear whistling notes shorter than the song of the long spur and uttered firom a rocky point or the top of some ledge at saint island on june we found them common and and some native children showed us a nest about yards back oi their huts this nest contained one which was obtained with the female after the latter was shot the male kept flying about our heads or from rock to rock close by and continually uttering a loud p p p p in such a plaintive tone that i was glad when we were out of eâ r shot as long as we remained in the vicinity this bird followed us from place to place hovering about not taking the notice of his nest after the female was shot he showed by his actions that he was fully aware of our having his mate in our possession i do not remember ever having seen a bird show such solicitude for his mate as was exhibited on this occasion as we landed upon the shore of island on august were found a pair of these birds with their grown young upon the beach and a number of others we found upon herald island this bird arrived at on april according to and it is known to breed commonly on and as well as throughout the islands and wherever the to the north of continental america have been visited the long one of the most numerous among the summer of the but occurs more on the a islands and along the shores of asia this bird generally portions of the coast least sought by the preceding its northern range appears to be limited and we do not find it either on or herald island although on the of it extends to point where full grown young were seen in august it is much more numerous on the shore than on the adjoining coast it commonly upon saint island but is uncommon at bay on the shore only about ninety miles distant there are and other places there which appear suitable as local yet the birds were not found the long spur occurs in the greatest numbers on the grassy and moss covered stretches of level or rolling along the american coast it was found along the north shore of asia where grassy afford suitable â but everywhere along the american coast the bird appears to be a very common summer resident and most plentiful where the full of the summer was not felt along the shores of n and sounds where the seasons are comparatively mild it is found in greatest abundance thousands of the birds appear on every hand as one about during the breeding season and in early spring at the commencement of the air is filled with music during the winter the long spur is not found in the country north of the islands in which latter region however the bird is a permanent resident although the long spur apparently a or portion of the continent it far to the north as is shown by being found upon southern i of and other far northern lands its southern bi range in appears to be along the chain where it has been found raising its young by mr 
44,and others op in the ocean is the sound on the islands this is a common summer resident and thence east and south along the shore it is also common it has not been recorded from the seal islands hence its northern range appears to be limited to this chain of islands and the adjoining coast aâ given during the it is found along the coast as far south as and washington but its breeding limit in this region is still unknown throughout the northern part of its range it is known to breed and we found it as late as october at and it arrived at this place the first of may some probably remain the entire winter but the majority pass farther south its habits are like those of its keeping to the grassy and the shore close along the water s edge where a portion of its food is this also is one of the several cases in which the islands and adjoining region furnish a longer bird than is found in the closely allied forms of the among these may be named and the and in addition to the case in hand as showing some of the most striking instances of this peculiarity is the western all along the coast of sea at least to point hope and probably to point this is a common bird especially along the coast between the and sound wherever the open moist stretches of comparatively level country afford suitable haunts it is found in large numbers although ant has been recorded saint and the region it is owing to an as is shown by an examination of ae specimens upon which this claim was based all of which are to is strictly limited to the coast of and is unknown to the north of this region on the contrary far to the north extending its breeding range inside the circle and its southern range in summer does not appear to on that of in winter however it is found passing south and mingling with its relatives in the coast region of the along the coast north of the to sound the is a rather common summer visitor and nests in many places it is one of the most musical birds that reaches these high along the coast with the opening spring and appearance of the first flowers comes this handsome whose charming notes and familiar presence about the houses render it an agreeable accompaniment of spring the last of may it appears in the vicinity of saint and taking the wood pile or some other convenient spot for its stage at intervals during the entire day pleasant frosty mornings particularly are by the notes of this bird and i recall pleasure the feeling of always produced by its song which seemed to form a part of the clear fresh frosty atmosphere and the brightening face of nature for a week or so after the bird s arrival its familiar presence is joyfully proclaimed by notes from the places mentioned after which it the vicinity of man for the on the where it the duties of the season a few weeks later during the last of july or the first of august it is ready to come about the houses again a memory of the good things found there early in the season serving to draw the bird from all sides the weed patches and grassy in the vicinity of the fort or the native village are filled with these birds and with their young they wax fat and upon the fare before them the young frequently come into the court yard and make themselves thoroughly at home and if the truth be told now and then one falls a victim to confidence and in the shape of a dried travels to distant parts of the world where among a host of his he as a specimen in autumn old and young alike have but the ordinary of in the ocean to a host of their kind at this season and they carry with them bat little of the interest attending their spring advent in the lower region and to the east these are abundant birds and are said to render the twilight hours of night during the short summer melodious with their songs often complained of their disturbing his rest by their persistent singing while he was down this river on the and other islands of sea and the coast this is an unknown bird it is the only form of white crowned found in the territory of and throughout the north the common bird of the eastern united states does not reach these high the golden spared w a rather rare summer on the shores of sound where it its favorite haunts are the same as those of the preceding species in the fall young and old with again on the feeding ground about the houses upon the and other islands in sea this bird is unknown nor have i any record of it along the coast north of sound the this is perhaps the commonest species of the bushes along the northern coast it arrives early in may or even the last days of april upon the shores of sound and like the white crowned its presence by first appearing about human at this time it especially such weed patches as have the storms of winter the convenient shelter thus formed making a favorite gathering place where the of the tree can be heard at all times and from which they make excursions to the garden spot by the kitchen or come into the yard they are always however and ready to into the of their place at the first alarm before the snow has left the where they make their nests they have taken possession as if in anxiety to commence their housekeeping in the course of time the snow the sturdy begin to open their and 
44,take on a shade of green while about their roots busy family groups are at work upon the soft grassy nest which soon contains their pretty o eggs all goes well unless some wandering breaks rudely in upon the happy pair and leaves a scene of ruin behind early in july the parents have a brood of full grown young which they straightway introduce to the vicinity of the houses where we soon find them in fall possession of the of the fort and ready to join in friendly companionship with the white crowns and young long spurs the crew associate in the most congenial way during this season of plenty and a crew they make all clad in dingy and dull each apparently without an object in life but to himself on the abundance of food which the plants begin to shower down ere long however the cold storms of autumn announce the approach of winter and send many of the more sensitive off to a climate september passes the and cold are more severe and as this month ends and october begins the last of the pass on to a this species on the shores of sound as far north as bushes are found i have no record of its occurrence on the adjacent shore although it is undoubtedly found on the it can scarcely be expected to occur upon any of the islands in sea from their bleak and character ji the black snow this is perhaps the most uncommon found upon the american shore of sea and can be noted merely as a from the interior of pretty regular occurrence in spring of in the ocean it is rarely seen more than two or three times daring the season at saint at the month it is rather more common it at this latter in small numbers and is also found in the vicinity of sound and bay as specimens brought me from those by natives indicate it is unknown from the shore to the islands of sea the among the peculiar birds found on the this is one of the most remarkable it forms the giant among its kin and would scarcely be connected with its eastern relative by one not familiar with the links in the chain which unite them it extends its range from the of the east to island it has been described under various names by the older who secured it during the occupation of the territory but as in many other instances the most of our knowledge of its life history and distribution is mainly the result of work done since the country changed owners during a brief residence at in the islands in may became somewhat familiar with the habits of this bird at that season and during the stay of the at the same place in the fall of i was pleased to renew the at another season they were common in both seasons and frequented in autumn as in spring tlie vicinity of the shore with a preference for points where great masses of rock lie at the water s edge or the rugged slope of the cliff reaches out into the bay it is the habit of this bird to hop from rock to rock and scramble about along their inclined faces searching for their food close to the water s edge where it on the small marine animals by the falling water oi living there between the tide lines the male frequently to the top of some convenient point and his short rather hard but pleasant song this song consists of several loud hard notes the first two the and most musical the others rather harsh as might be expected the size of the bird the song is stronger and louder than that of its relative the familiar song during the entire time of our stay at in september and october the showed their appreciation every pleasant day by passing a considerable portion of their time upon the roof of the at the wharf or other conspicuous position elsewhere uttering their song at short intervals this stood beside the wharf to which we were and the passing to and fro of the men handling cargo or attending to other duty made a scene of bustling activity in spite of this the bird was sure to be found whenever the weather favored at other times he could be found with one or two companions searching the sandy beach close by for food the common in summer along the coast of sound and extends its range north to the shores of sound its loud clear song rises from every patch of of any size along this stretch of coast and the birds upon their first arrival about the last of may come boldly about the dwellings uttering their loud clear song from the roofs of the and other convenient stand points at the mouth it is very common and i found its song one of the most musical and striking among the very scanty choir which the advent of summer at that remote place it is unknown from any of the islands in s sea as well as from the shore its range extends within the interior of the circle although the lack of bushes along the coast limits its occurrence except on the shores of the two sounds named s this species is admitted here solely by reason of the of s a as this bird one thing is certain and that is that since s type no specimen of this bird has been secured at although numerous have visited that op steamer in the ocean and paid special attention to its neither has the bird been found on any of the eastern islands of the chain which renders its occurrence here still more improbable occurs here however in three distinct one of which answers fairly to the very insufficient description given by the nearest where has 
44,been taken is on the islands south of the of of necessity the question of the exact application of s name must remain a matter of individual opinion but in view of the bird in question not having been taken on the island of or any of the neighboring ones it seems but fair to consider the chance of his description applying to one of the of m i allow the name to remain as mr from the fact that there is little possibility of proving the question for one side or the other but the of old names as in this where there is such opportunity for error the rusty along the eastern shore of sea both in the spring and autumn this bird is frequently seen it nests commonly at the mouths of the and as low down as the growth of bushes affords proper shelter it is a common summer resident in suitable places about the sound region extending its area far within the circle it arrives at saint michael s about the middle of may and leaves the coast region about the last of august or first of september it is unknown on the islands of sea and on the coast the american this bird is found abundant in many places and is more or less common everywhere on the islands and about the shores of this region on the islands it is perhaps in its greatest abundance and is remarkably familiar the of houses and the open ground immediately in front of them with as little regard for the presence of man as might be expected from the ordinary barn yard fowl even in this place however it keeps its weather eye out for the deadly gun and the moment one appears with this in his hand the become remarkably scarce in that immediate vicinity their curious high in the air preceding and during a storm are curious to witness and they are one of the most striking features to a new comer in the islands upon the seal islands the crow is absent though it is familiar on all the other islands of sea the and american coast alike are frequented by it both summer and winter found in the vicinity of the on the coast and during my winter journeys along the coast i found them everywhere though less numerous at this season than during the summer hi the black at the lead of bay this bird has been taken on a few occasions and this so far as my knowledge extends limits the range of the bird on the coast of sea although it is f â und in the interior much farther north the smoky in the interior this bird is one of the most common and stray individuals wander to the shore of the and sea from north to the shore of sound h ex e op steamer the ocean they are generally about the months of streams whose borders afford them the sheltered highway which their instinct leads them to favor the only specimen i ever saw close to salt water was on the shore of sea at we had at this cape the night before and were just leaving it as a heavy sea began to pushing off we had gained a few yards from shore when an odd note caused us to look back and there perched on a small bush close by the remains of onr camp fire stood one of these birds uttering his ludicrous cries as if making sport of ns for not finding him earlier the waves rendered the landing so dangerous that we were obliged to leave the bird in possession and whenever i recall the scene at this camp the in the mental picture is occupied by the comic attitude of this bird as he his tail and us from his safe ground e the white shore this bird occurs very rarely on the coast of sea i secured a single specimen at saint michael s â the first of may â and one or two others have been taken in that vicinity besides which i have no record of its occurrence anywhere within the region under discussion the numerous visits made by to these shores during the last few years and the of this bird in their prove it to be a great in this region both on the american and shores farther to the eastward in the interior the bird is more common but is still rare until the interior of the continent is reached all the specimens examined are to the name heading this article and it is that shore fix m would be to the same it is not known to occur on the or any of the other islands in sea it has been found as far north of the old world as and but it was not seen by us on the shores of or herald islands nor on the adjacent coast e the little two specimens of this bird obtained by me at saint michael s in the spring are the only ones found on the shore of sea they add very considerably to the bird s known range e s the the a common species in the interior of makes frequent visits to the sea shore in the north especially during the spring and fall it is then found the patches and rarely visits the houses i obtained a number of specimens from the and sides of the at saint michael s during my residence there it is more numerous at the mouths of the larger rivers as the and here the close approach of the wooded interior to the coast renders its presence common and it even nests close to the sea coast in the bushes on the lower it is not known from any island of sea nor from the coast but is found in the about sound at times ax 
45,w the yellow this is a still more uncommon bird on the shore of sea it approaches the coast about the head of sound and in rare instances on sound during the winter of op m the ocean i obtained a skin fix m a native on the coast near straits and was informed that the bird there rarely in summer and that it among the scattered forests a short distance in the interior it is unknown elsewhere in the region under discussion the although a not uncommon resident in the interior along the numerous water courses this bird is extremely rare on the sea coast a single specimen was brought in by a native from the near the mouth of a small river to the north of michael s and i heard of its capture at one or two other places on the shore of sound elsewhere i do not know of its although it is likely to be found about bay and perhaps the shores of sound where several water streams occur a io the owl along the entire chain and thence north along the of to point this bird is found as a summer resident on the islands it rather com mon and found it in on the in may found a pair of short near the and becoming very active after sunset several times while hunting at this time of day i disturbed the birds and found them extremely shy so much so that they would take flight a hundred yards or more in advance uttering at the same time a loud rolling cry during the several years succeeding this i found they arrived the last of may or first of june along the coast of to the north where they are summer and at times quite numerous there is no record of the bird from the islands in sea with the exception of the chain though its well known wandering habits undoubtedly take it to them at times neither is it recorded from the a coast of but its range extends through this region on the coast of the it is found nearly if not quite to point the great gray owl this fine owl can be reckoned as a very rare to the shores of sea its prefer ence for wooded country its range to those parts of the interior where and other trees afford it congenial shelter stray individuals occur at times along the shores of sound where the near approach of the forests to the sea along the banks of the various streams flowing into the sound afford it a convenient highway as might be inferred from the lack of timber it is a totally unknown species on all the islands of sea and i do not think it is found on the opposite coast unless by accident as the following species the shore la the owl but a single instance is known of this bird s occurrence in the region covered by this paper and tiie only american record as well this record rests upon a specimen secured some years since by l m at saint michael s sound it is a well known species in the wooded parts of north europe and and only occurs on the bare forbidding coast country as a stray wanderer r â op in the ocean s owl this old world form of the northern owl claims to the north american by the capture of a single individual near saint michael by mr l m beyond which there is no other record of it on onr shores it is throughout northern wherever occurs and like the owl reaches the open coast by merest chance its preference being for the shelter forests of the interior s owl this owl although a bird of the wooded interior also along the borders of the various water courses and reaches the shores of sea and sound at rare and irregular intervals it is well known to the natives who called it the blind owl because it cannot see well during the day time and is easily caught alive by the hand in the interior it becomes quite numerous and on the lower nests as low down as the vicinity of whence i have a set of its eggs the bird is found resident here only a few miles to the sea coast but this is exceptional as elsewhere the surroundings are not favorable for its presence the natives of the interior indians catch bird tie a small piece of dried fish to its back and and let it go claiming they will thus secure good fortune in the hunt and in other matters the owl among the which pay occasional visits to the coast of sea in as well as to the southern portion of its shores this bird may be reckoned as the most common scarcely an autumn passes but a number of individuals are seen occupying conspicuous places on piles of drift wood or other prominent places along the shore in the vicinity of saint michael s and thence north where it is well known to the natives occasionally it becomes bold enough to frequent the vicinity of the houses but this rarely occurs like the preceding with the exception of the first mentioned this is unknown on any of the sea islands it is also unknown from the shore so far as any records which i have seen go to show thb snowy owl from the month north along the entire as also on the northern islands in sea the coast of this sea and on the coast of the this is a resident bird perhaps most numerous in winter along the coast it is not uncommon in summer to see this owl perched along the brow of the cliffs the shore to the north of sound it is found to be extremely shy even in these far off regions and it is almost impossible to 
45,approach within rifle shot as we upon island and ascended the slope of the hill rising from the beach one of these birds arose over yards in advance and made off as though his experience of mankind had been anything but agreeable yet it is certain that his habitation at that time had never before been disturbed by man during some seasons when the at any particular point this bird becomes numerous and upon this small at times however it attacks and the northern hare and is one of the most dreaded enemies of the in winter it on noiseless wing close along the of the snow its white so completely with the white landscape that it is followed with the greatest difficulty by the eye ever and anon it and like a shadow as it takes its course along the shore or over the open country of in the ocean rich a ths hawk owl like most of the wood birds this is also a rare to the sea coast of sea aod sound where it occurs at intervals in the fall and spring i secured a fine specimen from the top of the at saint where it sat looking down upon the people moving about and did not show the slightest sign of fear until it was brought down with a broken wing when approached it threw itself in an attitude of aud its eye commanded one s admiration for bold and courage it occurs in about equal with the owl and is well known to the who confound it to a certain extent with s owl x la the hawk owl one specimen of this bird has been taken on the coast by l m near saint michael s in winter it is known from the shore and throughout northern the wooded portions of the country with occasional stray visits to the sea coast both this and the preceding are totally unknown on the islands of sea and of exceeding if they occur at all along the neighboring coast the approach of the wooded country along the sea shore the preceding form more convenient opportunities to the neighborhood of the sea yet their visits in these places are few and very short e am thb white the winter of i obtained a single skin of this fine from a native on the coast near strait this is the only instance i have ascertained of its occurrence on our coast although mr learned from the people at saint michael s during his residence there that the bird occurred at rare intervals and he adds that a little north of island one of these alighted in the of their vessel and remained with them for some time s although the previous variety is of such on the coast of sea the present form is one of the most abundant birds of prey found in this region a single specimen obtained by on the seal islands forms the only record from that group but found it on the chain and from the of north to point on the american shore and across the straits occupying the islands of that region and the coast of this is common and is a resident throughout the year it nests along the cliffs the sea shore or in the interior occupying the along the river banks it is most numerous in autumn when the young are found about almost every rocky cliff on the coast and it carries destruction among the at this season it has been claimed that this has a heavy and slow flight but after one watches the great ease with which it a in full flight its power of wing is readily proved am thb duck hawk a very rare species in the interior of northern this hawk is of still greater on the coast of sea where it is found only as an excessively rare in the spring and it is unknown from the islands and coast of sea and from the a of the on either side op in the s along the islands this bird rather common and at t points in his list of birds west of he heads the list with this species having it identified as mr me that this bird of which he has examined the specimen obtained by and which the was based is in reality a typical on september as the approached from the north six or seven of these birds were seen one after the other approaching from the east and after a about the vessel fi coming within thirty or forty yards they would make off to the west at this time the island was nearly twenty miles distant this was the only time that the bird was observed during the ten days spent at it is unknown north of the islands although it undoubtedly extends farther north along the shore the pigeon hawk this well known hawk occurs along the entire coast north beyond the shores of sound across sea it has been taken at bay and several other points on that coast of the birds of prey this is one of the most common species to visit the barren coast region and may be looked for as a rather and regular along the shores of sound strait and sound in spring summer and autumn a skin was brought on board the from one of the islands in strait in the summer ot although numerous in the portions of this region named it is yet unknown fix m the and seal islands the bleak rugged character of their shores probably proving to this small but bold am the american fish hawk in the interior the fish hawk is a not very uncommon bird as far north as the wooded country extends thence it occasionally visits the shores of sea two were seen the last of may at the mouth in and two specimens were brought me from the 
45,head of sound during the summer of these records include all the information i possess regarding this bird on the treated whether it is found on the shore or not in these high i have no information although its presence to the south in the islands and southward render it probable that it does the hawk a common along the shore of sea occasionally found on the islands and extending its range north beyond sound it undoubtedly occurs upon the adjoining coast of although i do not possess any record of its having been observed there the hawk like the pigeon hawk the sharp hawk occurs during the entire summer season from spring to but unlike the former it is of considerable and found as far as my information goes only i the coast including the shores of sea and sound but not extending to the islands of this sea nor to the coast of of in the the american wherever the is found iu the vicinity of the wooded country and far distant from a tree or this bold hardy bird is found as its unwelcome companion in spring the is occasionally seen passing over saint michael s as the first warm days begin then on until the breeding season is over it is seen no more but in autumn it returns to the sea coast in considerable numbers about the in abundance for a time aud like that species upon the among the many records of this bird s boldness i possess an additional one obtained during the visit of the to sound in september i had winged a on the top of the famous ice cliff of bay and the bird fell just beyond a small from me the instant the struck the ground i was surprised to see a dart out from a small patch near at hand and with a graceful inclination pick up the bird and make off with it which so surprised me that i stood watching the performance until the hawk had made good its escape as it flew away a second bird evidently its mate joined it aud the two passed over the hill and disappeared from view by a comparison of specimens in the institution with the considerable series obtained by me in the north i have reached the conclusion that mr s variety is nothing but the assumed by the older birds as is readily shown by several specimens in which the change made from the to that of the is taking place mr has examined the same series and with me iu this conclusion the american rough legged hawk along the entire coast of sea and the including at least the eastern portion of the islands the rough legged hawk is a common resident in summer at i found a pair breeding upon a cliff near the village and secured one of the birds with their eggs in may at saint michael s it was found npon cliffs on the border of a small lake in the interior of the island and the bird was among the most common of the birds of prey the specimen is in every particular from a european specimen in the collection and the basis for the separation of the american bird from that of europe and the northern portions of the old world generally is merely in the black phase assumed by the american bird in the bay and adjoining region in this phase is unknown as far as my observation goes aud is totally in the considerable series of specimens ob by myself and various others in that region this being the case aud various birds which i have examined being so closely related to the old world form it ap ears necessary to recognize them under the name of the old world bird thus the j to that portion of the continent where it actually occurs the rough leg occurs in aud in china is a species with dark feathers to the but very similar in other respects to s the golden eagle this is one of the among the birds of prey on the shores of sea and the a portion of the ocean i know of no record of its occurrence on the shore nor on the islands of sea but in the winter of i saw portions of one of these birds in a native village near strait and fragments of their skins were brought to me in one or two instances from the shore of sound daring my residence at saint michael s the and tail of this bird like those of the bald eagle are highly by the for use iu their religious op steamer in the ocean the bald eagle among the islands this eagle is very abundant and as many as ten or fifteen may be seen in a single day over a limited area it is a here finding an abundance of high and upon which to rear its young and about which it in fine weather north along tbe coast this eagle is rather uncommon owing mainly to the very low flat character of the country wherever the coast becomes or on the one is pretty certain to find one or more pairs of these birds in the vicinity it considerably within the wherever the character of the country is such as to attract the abundance of and other game has its influence as well during my residence at saint michael s a number of birds were seen passing over and quite a number of skins were brought me by the from various points along the coast to straits and sound the great sea eagle of the coast and islands has been reported from the chain but the bald eagle was mistaken for it e can ace the this one of the of oar occurs from the northern states through british america to the shores of sea at the head of 
45,sound where the forests approach and directly border on the shore it is not abundant here but is a resident and farther in the interior it becomes more numerous its range may approach the sea shore again about the head of bay where the forest reaches within a short distance of the coast but we have no from that region in the wooded interior of this fine is represented by a closely relate l form which is not known to approach any of the shores under discussion the from the vicinity of straits is identical in every way with specimens from and new and thus shows less to influence than the following species i s x the in the same as the preceding is found occurs this bird which forms the northern variety of the familiar or of the entire eastern north america i had no opportunity to learn anything of special interest concerning the habits of either this or the preceding species along the coast region mentioned with the exception of the wooded country at the head of bay there is no portion of the sea coast where either the or would occur as the remainder of the shore and all the islands are destitute of trees and the white the white or willow occurs in greater numbers in northern than all the other species of combined along the northern portion of the country wherever open country occurs it is found in and especially along the shores of sea and the ocean where it in great numbers the last of april and first of may throughout this region from the mouth of the river north to point the loud notes and peculiar movements of the form one of the most characteristic features at this season and render the birds very conspicuous it is found on the a coast of as well as on the american shore but does not occur on the islands with the single exception of steamer in the ocean perhaps of the island adjoining the of where two s of are said to occur to the west of the island on the chain it is not found being replaced by the species mentioned below neither is it found on the fur seal nor any of the other islands in sea with the possible exception of saint in the autumn just previously to the severe winter storms there is a of this from the coast south to the valleys of the and where the of willow and it refuge during the winter as spring re opens it passes to the north and itâ breeding grounds some the among these however remain during the entire winter in the extreme north on while the lay in sound these were gathering in considerable flocks preparing for their southern they were found along the shore where the abundant supply of afforded them food they were attended as usual by numerous and several were seen in the vicinity in spring while the are paying court to the objects of their choice they select some slight elevation such as a prominent or a snow bank upon which they take their stand and utter their loud harsh note of defiance or do battle with some free lance of their kind ri the rock along the eastern shore of sea and the ocean in wherever the mountains or high hills approach the sea this occurs it is found in the immediate vicinity of saint michael s the hill tops in summer and seeking the shelter of the and about their in winter on the coast to the north reaching the vicinity of strait i found them numerous in the winter of they are much more than the preceding species and will allow a very close approach standing with their heads raised and a pretty air of about them in winter their beautiful milk white with the sharply contrasted jet black bill and bar through the eye renders them very handsome objects particularly when seen in life their shape and movements on the ground are also much more graceful and elegant than those of the ordinary they exist in far smaller numbers than the white and their range is more owing to the low and little varied character of the northern coast country wherever low mountains or hills occur throughout the northern portion of the territory however this bird may be confidently expected to occur on the islands it is represented by forms which are mentioned below and the shore has a form x identical with this but as professor records those taken by the party at their winter quarters as l this name is accepted as applying to the bird since there are no specimens at hand from that region ri on the island of thence to the eastward and also to the westward for an uncertain distance occurs the handsome above of this form there are but two specimens in existence in the summer these are a male and female obtained by me on the hills back of in the spring of the winter bird of which the l a single example obtained by mr is from the winter of the ordinary rock this specimen the black border through the eye but this character appears to be merely individual this is the species which in mr ball s papers on the birds of the islands he as the white and in the of the club for i recorded the capture of the two i previously mentioned under the name of beyond the mere capture of the bird there is little known of its habits the only which i can furnish being that it the mountain tops and slopes among the eastern islands and is common there breeding during june the detailed description of this form will be given in the of the birds of now in course of preparation h ex of steamer in the ocean at the western end of the chain occurs 
46,another form of as is shown by specimens secured on the island of by mr l m during his residence at that place this form in several important from the birds as it does also from the bird of the mr has his interesting variety as given at the head of this paragraph and describes it in his to the of which at the present writing is being prepared concerning the habits of this form i possess no information its distribution however must be limited since it is found only on the western extremity of the chain and very probably forms merely a local race peculiar to the island where obtained perhaps extending its range to the few adjoining islands on the north coast of occurs this form according to the narrative of the s voyage in which records finding this species resident at their winter quarters on the coast to the of straits in the middle of december he found a flock of fifty of them at still farther to the west along the shore occurs this or an allied species as records a species of upon the new islands which is the same as is found on the adjacent coast of it seems remarkable that these birds should be able to sustain life during the intense cold and fierce storms which sweep over these desolate islands in his voyage of the states that they found a fell in the winter of just south of the parallel on where about of these birds he thinks some of these at times in among the rocks or pass the winter in a kind of state whether this theory is justified by the facts or not it certainly appears very curious that these are able to winter in o north latitude passing safely through the several weeks of continuous total darkness which occurs there in and be found fat and vigorous as soon as the sun appears above the horizon yet such are the recorded facts just how the bird to exist during this time remains to be satisfactorily accounted for the x found in to which this relates is the la just what the relationship is which the rock of bears to those found on the adjacent coast of north america and to the islands races remains a question to be solved only when a series of the birds from the various regions in question may be brought together at present the material in this group is entirely insufficient to make any definite statement on the matter and it will remain for some future to solve the problem it is to be hoped that some of the present parties now in that region will bring material which will aid in settling this interesting subject h pall the black the black although one of the most robust of the found in the north does not extend its range beyond the shores of the islands and thence across to the islands and adjoining coast where it is recorded by the common along the entire coast from the islands north to point this bird is a summer resident although it does not occur in abundance at any point its habits are very similar to those of the other small with which it associates during this season in autumn of in the ocean it passes to the south and is found on the various islands of sea except perhaps the chain where it is yet to be recorded although as it has been found abundant during the on the seal islands by there is no doubt whatever that it also visits the chain in addition to along the west coast of america it also passes along the coast by way of the islands to and southward where it has been recorded in winter and the has recently received spring birds in breeding firom to the north along this coast it occurs as far as strait if not beyond a number of pairs were seen and with nests on saint island the last of june and while the was in the vicinity of cape during the first of august found these birds quite numerous on the hills back from the coast where they had been breeding earlier in the season the young were on the wing at the time of our visit and were found with their parents seeking their food about the dry portions o the country in preference to their usual haunts along the sea shore or low grassy they were seen afterwards near point and at sound the black this species is far more numerous on the coast of during the summer than is the preceding it abundantly about the coast of sound and its familiar form is met everywhere on the flat grassy and about the borders of pools in this region as the approached island during the first of august on her several attempts to i each that land small parties of these birds came off and about the ship with wistful curiosity as if to inquire the cause and purpose of this invasion into these heretofore shores they c also observed once or twice in the vicinity of herald island on shore at island we did not see a single example of these birds although our hasty visit might readily account for this they occur on both of sea their winter home so far as recorded appears to be confined to the west coast of america a a no instance is known to me of its capture during this season on the coast of asia it may be remarked here that among the very large collection of these two species of obtained by me in the north and compared with the extensive series from that region which exists in the collection there does not appear to be the slightest of the characters showing an approach of the two forms so there is every reason for agreeing with mr and the 
46,black a distinct species the common of the sea coast and eastern asia perhaps including those which are found on the islands of the south pacific appear to show an average much darker than birds from middle and america and it is possible that it may be necessary to separate it from its eastern relative as a race in which case the is proposed for the new form gray the surf during several successive at saint michael s i had the good fortune to secure specimens of this widely spread and interesting bird it had previously been taken along the coast of the north pacific reaching the shore of and thence southward but the i resent record is the first of its occurrence in sea and places its range beyond north latitude and it undoubtedly reaches the vicinity of strait which lies but a short distance farther to the north in the vicinity of saint michael s it the rocky shores of the small islands and the whose rugged beach lines afford them congenial haunts their habits and feeding grounds are exactly those of the wandering and both species occur in autumn or during the entire month of august which answers in this latitude to the beginning of autumn in more southern they are never common but appear as stray individuals and are not shy of steamer in the ocean s the black this er reaches the shores of sea in may and remains to bi at various points the vicinity of the larger river mouths by preference although it occurs at various other along the t its range also extends to the shore where it is not numerous and north to point in it has not been recorded from any of the islands of sea although from its known range on the it undoubtedly occurs on many of them the american golden the large form of the golden which is so familiar to all in the eastern united states extends its summer range north and to the shores of the ocean and thence to the entire coast of sea occasionally to the adjacent shore and the islands in this sea whence specimens have been obtained along this portion of its range including the sea islands and the north coast its with that of the small form which also comes to these northern in summer to rear its young the golden is one of the as well as most interesting of the in the north and its gentle habits and sweetly mo notes make it a very welcome visitor during the season the have a rich liquid song of the most musical character and their beautifully blended black white and golden renders them very conspicuous the pacific golden the first record of this form on american territory was in s condition of affairs in here is described a single specimen of typical w which he obtained upon saint paul island during my residence in the north i gathered a large series of golden mainly from the coast of sound and among these i found every step of between the large eastern american and small eastern form a strange fact to be noted here is that the taken on the sea coast of average large and show characteristics which render them more closely allied or identical with the eastern american form whereas the young birds taken in the same are so covered with rich golden spots an l that they would be referred to the variety along the entire shore of sea this form occurs as a summer resident wherever the country is sufficiently level to it i feeding l and breeding places it was also one of the few birds we found on island a single specimen in breeding being seen when we made our landing on the th of august as in the case of the the golden is yet to be recorded from the islands although it must necessarily visit them during its while between and the st of october a small of these birds were seen passing overhead their course directly for the islands which were about one thousand miles distant at the time they make this long flight twice passing to and fro across the entire north and winter upon the islands north of the chain the semi on both shores of sea extending on the coast from the of north to point and along the entire coast to the of strait wherever we landed from the during the summer of these birds were found although it was not seen abundantly in any locality but a pair of were of in the ocean found in almost every instance where we made the land except on and herald islands it was found on saint island in sea and i noted it as a regular but not numerous summer resident on the shore of sound the there is a single record of this bird s occurrence in two specimens were obtained on in sound during the summer of by the english search ship and were for a long time in sir john s collection presented a few years since to the university museum at oxford where the examples are to be found at present the record of this is in the proceedings of the society of page where mr j e makes various interesting remarks concerning the different birds in this collection s this bird is abundant in the interior of the fur where it it is among the most uncommon of the found along the

47,by the last species there is no record of its occurrence on the shore nor is it known from any of the sea islands the red backed sand about the entire sea shore of north of sound and across along the adjoining coast of wherever we landed during the summer of this bird was found abundant a number of specimens were secured at cape on august and are identical with specimens secured on the american coast it wherever found in this region and is one of the commonest arriving at saint michael s early in may and it appears throughout this region as rapidly as the snow leaves the ground sufficiently bare for birds to secure their food it was also noted as common on saint island in sea but it is unknown elsewhere on the islands of this sea except as an occasional to the seal islands during the the semi sand along the entire coast from the of to point as well as on the coast of asia and saint island sea this small sand is a common summer resident breeding wherever the land the coast is level and dotted with pools or it is perhaps the most abundant of the throughout this region and its rapid note is heard on every hand during the day in the season the in mr s list of the birds of he gives the present species as common at and thence down the to the sea coast during the time of my residence in the territory and including the various points visited during the of the on both the and american shores not a single individual of this l was seen it occurs however in this region but is irregular and i am inclined to think somewhat rare we learn from a letter in the new york herald from mr that while the party were passing to the op steamer in the ocean of the there was a considerable number of these birds seen upon island one of the group on august and they secured twelve of th birds this is not a bird in these regions but specimens have been seen and procured by nearly every expedition and its distribution renders still more strange the great of the bird on the sound shore where during the four years i passed there not an individual was seen it is known however from the eastern coast of asia on the shores of and china as well as on the islands and along the pacific coast of america in the middle gray the pacific during both on the islands and thence north along the other islands of sea and abundant on the sea shore of during the breeding season it is not known to nest however except on the merely during its passage to and fro upon the islands mentioned it is also known from although no examples were seen during the summer of at the points we visited in the nor was it seen to the north of straits either on the shore of sound or beyond and i do not know of its occurrence there the loud notes of this bird and its large size render it one of the most conspicuous among the of the sea coast of its presence there in considerable numbers makes it a characteristic and important member of the they arrive in the vicinity of saint michael s the last of may or first of june and after leave for the south during august a few only remaining until september the mr secured two specimens of this bird at the mouth during his in that region beyond which there is no record of its presence on the coast of sea i did not see a single individual in that region and it must be of considerable nor is it known from any of the sea islands and the coast the yellow legs this bird is an extremely rare accidental to the coast of sea in it is perhaps more numerous at the mouth than elsewhere in the vicinity of saint michael s two or three specimens were secured during four mainly in august after the breeding season was over when like other birds these appear to wander from their breeding grounds visiting parts of the country unknown to them in the breeding season the wandering every summer as the end of july approaches or august begins this bird makes its appear ance about the rocky and along sound in the vicinity of saint michael s its habits are very retired and unless its haunts were visited not a single individual would be seen in spring it occurs very and ha been taken at this season even up the to and and undoubtedly a few breed in this region but the majority are birds which have wandered from more southern points it occurs quite frequently on all the islands of sea their rocky shores and isolated position apparently rendering them favorite grounds when disturbed on their feeding grounds these usually show but little but fly on easy wings a short distance and when they alight are readily they are seen except singly although several may be found at times in the same vicinity the young birds obtained in fall are less brightly marked than the spring their note is a loud ringing whistle which seems specially fitted to the bird and the haunts it and as the shrill cry re echoes h ex â t of steamer in the ocean from tbe towering cliffs and at the base of which it its peculiar character and might lead one to fancy some of the rocks was its cry when the birds are approached by boat as they are feeding along the water s edge they ascend gradually with an expression of mild curiosity and pass from ledge to ledge until they a point on the face of the cliff or its brow where they stand in relief like 
47,beautiful clear cut and do not utter a sound or move until they are still further alarmed when they take flight uttering at the same moment their loud note before mentioned this bird is as common upon the sea shore of as it is upon the coast but it is not known to the north of strait on either coast the sand like the preceding species this handsomely bird is a great wanderer it is found over nearly the entire globe especially the continental portions and its way regularly in spring to nest in the far northern regions on the of sea it is rare a single pair obtained at saint michael s in spring being the only two that i saw during a four years residence there on the north side of however it was found quite common in the vicinity of cape early in august although it is so in the sea region it is very abundant at various points on the coast and the lower course of the river in british america may be especially mentioned as it has been found breeding there in the greatest abundance the this is mainly known on the shore of sound as a in the spring and autumn a few however remain to breed there as the snow in spring towards the end of may the loud clear whistle of this species is a welcome sound as it the mild weather of early summer remaining but a short time at this season the majority pass still further to the north in autumn they return early in august or the last of july and feed upon the various until into september when they depart for the south it is unknown on the islands of sea and adjoining shores of it is however found on the shore north to the vicinity of point an l undoubtedly visits saint island and the coast during the summer the though much smaller than the latter this bird considerably it and is much more common during all the summer season on the coast of sound its habits and haunts are almost identical with those of its larger relative except that it more frequently in the southern of its range both forms appear at the mouth in spring and during the breeding season both reach high northern at least to the limit of continental lands at on the north coast august four specimens of this bird were seen passing over and were the only seen upon the coast during our various visits to that shore has recorded its presence on the seal islands during the and it probably visits most of the sea islands at this time it occurs all along the coast of wherever suitable occur the although is the largest found on the sea coast of it is as well the most uncommon the only of its presence there rests upon the capture of a single male in the spring of when i saw a pair feeding upon the last year s which covered the op steamer the i l slightly land an extensive series of it lad a load clear note very similar to that of the and was not shy i readily approached them and secured the male and afterwards severely wounded the female the only other instance of its capture in the north is the single specimen secured at by in â it is a well known bird on the islands of the south pacific where it exists in great numbers but its presence in the north is rather unexpected and like that of several other birds the pacific golden and pacific which wander to regions in summer its winter home is among those islands the south pacific ill the red the present handsome species is extremely abundant on the and coast of the north to and herald islands and thence south along both shores of sea it from the mouth of the river north along the coast of and on the coast mainly along the northern shore throughout the breeding season it is l rather closely to the shore but when the young are and able to follow their parents all leave the shore behind or frequent the and lakes in the immediate vicinity of the sea the few vessels which break the monotony of these northern waters in summer find the waves on every hand these and graceful birds their quick and elegant movements attention while their numbers render them conspicuous as they wheel and circle in flocks about the vessel their wings flashing in the to the in this region they are known with the next species birds from their habit of feeding upon minute which afford the right whale or its food hence a community of interests these and the largest of the north to prey upon the same fare a logical follows based upon experience by which the the presence of wherever this elegant bird is to be found in great numbers we saw it repeatedly while in the ice oft and herald islands and thence across the to point or the sea coast the calm spaces between the large fields and blocks of ice afford favorite tor the members of the numerous bands of along the edge of the pack they are quite plentiful around the entire and are familiar to and who visit this dreary region they are among the few species which the forbidding climate of the highest does not appear capable of from making their summer home there found this bird s eggs laid on the bare ground of and reports it as the species along the north coast of asia the northern like its relative just mentioned the northern is an extremely abundant bird in the north although its disposition is perhaps less and less northern than the one just described on the sea coast of the northern is in great excess of its relative thence north the red is the more numerous 
47,and especially so i n various parts of the on the northern coast of the northern was found whereas the other species was in the greatest abundance both forms unite in the same flocks and were found throughout the sea as far as the penetrated during the summer of but in this part of the range the northern in spite of its name was less and less numerous the farther north we advanced while the other species was in equal number throughout both birds occur during the about the and other islands of sea but the northern appears to be the only species breeding in the chain and thence north to saint island where the red nests we learn from that the northern on and at the new islands besides being found all along the north coast v of steamer in the ocean the little from the of north along the of to sound this small northern representative of the well known sand hill is found breeding in abundance especially towards the northern portion of this range it also occurs on saint and saint islands though it occurs in small numbers at these points during his visit to saint s island on august saw a few of these birds and it has been found on the east coast in the vicinity of saint bay where saw a considerable number of them as he was passing south in july after in the until very recently this bird has been confounded with the larger sand hill and various authors who have referred to from the northern region of america according to our present knowledge referred to the present bird which this territory exclusively on the coast of sound it is extremely common and throughout the summer from early in may until toward the end of september its loud rolling note and tall figure over the are among the most sights and sounds of this region they are not very shy and i have frequently approached them within by merely appearing not to notice them but continuing in a circuit to walk round their position until within sixty or seventy five yards the bird continuing to stare at me and uttering its long note and appearing as if doubtful whether it was worth while to take wing or not until its thoughts were by a shot they are extremely curious at this season and i have frequently them within by lying upon the ground and waving a hand or some conspicuous article in the air as the birds approach from a distance they will almost invariably turn and try to investigate the matter before passing on their way in many cases they only make a slight from their course and pass on but i have frequently had six or eight of the birds about until some would approach within thirty five or forty yards offering an easy prize their food is composed of the various which grow so abundantly on the of the north with an addition of whatever other are found such as a stray or mouse or even insects and other small that chance may afford they are not very good eating although takes its turn in varying the of the fare in the north â ducks whistling swan during the of the this fine bird was observed but once this occasion was on july while we were at the head of sound where it was found with feathers as were the at that place although the swan was seen so rarely during this expedition yet the bird is to be found in large numbers along the coast of sea here it especially from the mouth south to the mouth of the river where the flat land dotted with innumerable lakes affords a favorite resort it was not seen on the coast and i have no record of its occurrence there but this or an allied species occurs there on the american shore but a single species of swan occurs the large swan not being known west of fort we learn from mr s paper on the birds of the islands that several specimens of this swan were shot upon island in september some years ago but they are unknown from the chain proper and from the other islands in sea of steamer in the ocean h pall snow on the american coast of the and sea this bird is not very abundant it occurs however in considerable flocks for a few days daring the spring and fall and each season a f w are killed in the vicinity of saint michael s on sound its occurrence upon the north coast of asia is by specimens captured by s party at in the spring of these birds are at present like the swan unknown from the islands of sea their apparently taking an inland course rather than along the shore lines although the snow are known to nest in the greatest abundance in the river and surrounding region along the northern coast of british america yet their place in is unknown they certainly do not remain to nest anywhere along the sea coast and we did not see any of these birds along the shore to point so that if they nest at all in this region it must be on those the shore east of point in autumn they leave for the south among the last of the finding their way to the vicinity of saint michael s towards the end of september although in some seasons they appear before the middle of this month they linger here in autumn from ten days to three weeks depending upon the weather to a great extent the great abundance of tliis bird in during the winter season would testify to its breeding in great numbers somewhere to the north of this region but according to my observations on the sea coast of the bird must take some other route towards its northern 
47,breeding ground and it must undoubtedly pass north from and soon after cross the mountain to reach their eastern slope after which the pass to the by an inland course otherwise the snow would be found in greater abundance on the of this northern territory the american goose this is the most widely distributed and abundant goose throughout northern extending its across to the coast of sea and as well upon saint we found it in considerable numbers at the head of sound the middle of july and found many of the with their wing feathers and unable to fly and the young still in at that time it is extremely common from the mouth of the river to the head of sound everywhere thence north to the extreme coast of the territory wherever one goes in suitable places this bird is certain to be found during the spring and fall the white goose is found rather throughout the chain having been taken at and but their visits are only made at this season as none are known to remain and breed the white goose the distribution of this bird along the shores of northern is almost identical with that of the white goose with the addition however of the chain which is contained within the breeding range of the present bird like the last species it was found at the head of on july where it was very numerous it occurs in the greatest abundance in the vicinity of the mouth and along the adjoining portion of that coast there is no record of its presence on saint island but on the western portion of the chain it is a regular summer resident its young in considerable numbers upon the isolated islands there the natives at these western islands have considerable numbers of these birds and whether caused by confinement or otherwise the white collar on the neck di the brown op steamer in the ocean of the body color from the jet black of the head and neck was very conspicuous and an inch in width in some specimens seen at the autumn of the small flock of these seen at with their dark handsomely contrasted colors and gentle ways made very interesting and fine looking they were noted upon the seal islands by who tells us that they occurred there as irregular or straggling which remained but a short time before their line of there is no record of this species from the shore where however it undoubtedly occurs it reaches the extreme northern coast of where it a the larger white goose the present bird although with the latter species in ordinary examples sufficiently to be readily distinguished mainly by its lighter colors and larger size its distribution is somewhat different as well do not know of its occurrence on the chain and in fact its abundance appears to be greatest at the mouth and thence up this river and perhaps to the southward north of the mouth it is much less common than the smaller form and at saint ten of the smaller birds were secured to every one of the larger form at the mouth the proportion of the two forms is about equal all of the birds seen sufficiently near to ascertain their identity while we were in sound were of the smaller form and i doubt if the larger bird the subject of the present notes occurs in any considerable numbers north of the sea coast except in the interior where it is found along the course of the the true canada goose so well known in eastern north america is unknown anywhere on the lower y and the coast of either on the sea or shores the black on the shores of sea including the various islands and coast the black occurs in large numbers during the spring during this season it is in such numbers that it affords better sport than all of the other combined and is the bird which most frequently on the fur s table at that season in autumn it occurs much more rarely only straggling parties being found along the shore as autumn in ball s notes on the of the islands he speaks of securing the eggs of this bird on the islands near and at and this note however is to be referred to the white goose which on these islands but the black is unknown there during the breeding season its farthest south breeding point which i have been able to ascertain is the mouth where i saw a single bird in june thence north it is extremely rare until the vicinity of strait is passed after which occasional pairs occur with more or less during the breeding season until the low northern coast from beyond cape to point is reached and thence eastward the bird in great abundance wherever the flat country affords it suitable grounds while at point in august a considerable number of these birds were brought off by the natives and an examination showed that they were their feathers thus proving that they were summer in the vicinity captain smith an experienced and in these waters has me of having seen these birds going and coming to the northward of point thus proving the existence of land farther north in that direction they are also known to breed in the greatest abundance along the northern shores of british america selecting the lower of the large rivers which flow into the in that region the natives informed me that occasional pairs were found breeding in the vicinity of saint michael s but that they were extremely rare on the first of june a single pair were seen by me a few miles south of that place and by their anxiety showed plainly that their nest was in the vicinity this with the single individual seen at the mouth is the only instance which came directly to my knowledge of 
48,its occurrence during the breeding season south of the straits although it undoubtedly occurs on the shore of steamer in the ocean jet it was not by us daring our along that coast in the summer of nor was it seen on island although on this island we saw evidences of the presence of some species of but our short stay prevented our their identity mr tells us that upon his return to the coast of in the latter part of october enormous flocks of these birds were seen about one hundred miles off shore as they were flying south frequently in the water near the ship goose this strange and handsome bird has the most limited range of any species of it and raises its young on the sea coast of from the mouth of the river north ta strait but north from the mouth it is l very rarely from the mouth south to cape may l e taken as the i of its greatest abundance here it occurs in thousands every summer from this point it extends its range to the westward an l occurs in considerable numbers upon saint island where we saw considerable numbers of them while we were lying at anchor off the end of the island during this time flocks of birds were passing and along this end of the island ai on their way to and from some favorite feeding ground at cape several birds were seen the first of july and they were found by arriving at his winter quarters at on the northern coast of in the spring as soon as the snow left and he speaks of them in his account of the s voyage as the painted goose of there is a record of two or three instances of their occurrence in port on the american shore of strait and i know of two pairs being taken in bay on the north coast of sound and others at on bay with the chain of continued south by saint michael s to the mouth but at all these points except the last this bird is very rare just how numerous it is on the coast is still unknown but from its large numbers along the american shore and its mainly to the islands where it is found in the greatest abundance at this season on the various parts of the it may be confidently as an american species which extends its range during the summer to portions of the coast my first acquaintance was made with this bird on island just east of in may when a native brought one on board the vessel and we learned from him that it is more or less common wherever open are found along these islands and in consequence are called beach by the natives those groups of rocky to the south of the chain known as the and islands and others lying nearer the south shore of the form the principal ground of this thence to the west along the entire chain it occurs but in less numbers than on that portion just mentioned the duck on the entire sea coast of the common is a comparatively rare duck it is most numerous from the northern shore of sound in the vicinity of saint michael s south to the mouth of river but is nowhere abundant it was not seen by us during the of the nor is it recorded from tlie coast or the within the region treated in this paper a pair of these birds which reared their young on the saint paul island of the fur seal group during the season of and several others were seen later in the season he also noted the bird on saint s island but not as a regular it is recorded by mr as one of the most abundant winter visitors among the ducks at in considerable numbers by october and from then until the succeeding month of april it was very numerous it is not known to breed on the but only along the coast and islands to the northward op ik the ocean the duck this is perhaps the most abundant fresh water duck found on the coast of sea and the shores to the north it nests yearly in the greatest abundance all along the coast from the of to the farthest northern extreme of in the vicinity of point being perhaps in greatest lance on the shores of and sounds we found them numerous about sound during our there and several were seen on saint island in sea during our visits there they also occur on the north coast and in fact were noted at almost every place we landed where the surrounding country affords them the proper tracts while at sea between the islands and san on october a bird which at a distance appeared very much like the female of this species was seen about overhead for ten or fifteen minutes after which it started off toward the south whether this was the present species or not it was of course impossible to say but from its form and motions it was evidently some species of fresh water duck in autumn these birds become extremely fat and well and they are the finest table duck afforded in the north while their abundance renders them easily and large numbers are secured by the fur in autumn and stored for winter use they move south among the latest of the water fowl the last ones in october and they return again in spring when the open spaces begin to appear in the ice along the shore â sometimes by the first of may or even before in unusually early i have seen several of them about one of these holes in the ice caused by several springs on the shore when the whole country was covered with a deep of snow and winter still appeared in full 
48,force the european the only record of this si in is that given by who secured specimens upon the seal islands he tells us that he saw but a few specimens and these were apparently solitary examples never in pairs and the few he observed his two years residence on the fur deal islands were apparently or straggling specimens this species is also recorded by as obtained at on the th of october who adds that it is not uncommon among the ducks brought in by the native hunters at that season and tells us that it about the st of may it has not been recorded from any other points or islands on the american side of the sea but the records quoted render it highly probable that its capture on the is a matter of time and further work in that region in the vicinity of saint michael s it must be extremely rare as i carefully examined all the ducks brought in during my residence at that place with the hope of securing some of these birds but failed american on the sound coast of sea this is a com non bird it is found breeding along the entire coast of sea and north to sound and the c a t beyond it was not noted by us upon any of the islands visited in the vicinity pf strait during the summer of nor on the shore but on september of that year when we visited the shore at in sound a number were obtained from the natives who told us that they were numerous in that vicinity at the time they leave for the south a little earlier than the pin duck and arrive later in spring cl spoon duck along the coast of sea mainly limited to that portion between the head of sound and mouth of the river this duck is not uncommon although it is of in the ocean nowhere abundant in the of saint michael s it arrives in spring about the middle of may with the majority of other water fowl and nests on the surrounding leaving for the south towards the end of september it has not been recorded from any of the sea islands nor do i know of its having been taken on the shore of it is found however on the shore of north to sound if not beyond and a few were observed bj us towards the middle of september at the head of bay blue winged during the time of my residence on sound not a single individual of this bird was taken among the many hundreds of ducks secured by the various about the station it occurs however very rarely at this place and is recorded by as being found at the mouth mr notes it as not at saint michael s in early spring but there must be some error in this record from the great of the bird at the same locality during the period of my residence there captain smith saw the bird and obtained its eggs from near cape and this com our record of this within the region treated in the present paper it is mentioned by mr as perhaps at in winter but this was merely as no specimens were and the habits of this species are such that there is little probability of its there winged this handsome bird is the smallest duck found in the north and occurs rather frequently along the shore of sea and north nearly if not quite to point along the shore of the it has been found as a summer resident of the islands as far west as and is occasionally at near the western extreme of the chain mr tells us that it was upon this species they relied mainly for supplying their table during their surveying in the western portion of the chain and he found the young ones abundant at in july further to the north however it is less numerous and although generally distributed and rather common yet during a day s shooting one would scarcely see more than a half dozen or so of this species at most they arrive early in the spring â about the middle of may or â before the ice and snow have more than partly disappeared it is not known from the shore nor from the islands of sea except the chain although it undoubtedly upon saint island a number of these birds were bought from the natives of in sound september where they were apparently numerous at the time duck this is one of the most abundant ducks in the north being found breeding almost everywhere on the and lake dotted of the and extending its range to such islands as it suitable feeding grounds both this and the smaller species are recorded by as at the mouth but according to the observations i was enabled to make at tliat locality and in the region among hundreds of ducks seen not a single individual could be referred to anything but the common large species and i do not think reaches the sea shore of northern the large however as before noted is extremely numerous and its young on the borders of almost every and pool along the entire coast it occurs on saint island and north about the shores of sound and probably beyond to the extreme north coast of the territory it was not noted by us upon the shore of but undoubtedly occurs there during the summer h ex of steamer in the ocean american golden eye this is a very rare species on the shores of sea the only instance where i met with it alive was late in autumn near saint michael s where a party of four was seen in a small i three of which were secured it occurs more commonly along the streams of the interior but it is rare along the 
48,sea shore and i have no of its presence about sound although it undoubtedly reaches that point it is unknown from the islands of sea and the shore of butter ball duck this beautiful little duck is reported by mr as not uncommon at the mouth where it but no specimens of it were noted during my residence at saint nor did i see it on my visit to the mouth in the spring of mr s record is the only one this species to the shore of sea and no further records are at hand of its occurrence in that region it is also unknown from the shores of the coast of and sound in addition to the islands and coast visited by the duck this richly marked bird is found on the shores and islands of sea extending into the but north of the straits it is much loss numerous on the islands it is an abundant species especially in winter and spring during may at they were extremely numerous in large flocks the inner but were too shy to allow close approach mr us that they remain later than most other ducks and also notes their occurrence in summer on the islands it along the coast to the northward from these islands and records it as being extremely numerous about the fur seal islands where it occurred close along the beach in flocks of hundreds keeping closely together and comparatively heedless of approach this author records his total inability to secure any of the eggs of this bird although they were permanently resident there in summer and he offered large to the natives the females appeared to the two to one and he was at a loss to account for not securing its nest the probability is that these b were barren females or young of the preceding ear which for some cause did not pass to their northern breeding ground but remained here feeding upon the abundant animal life found in these waters it haunts the clear cold streams of the interior which flow down the mountains and empty into the and its the bird seeks secluded pools in these waters and the natives when wishing to hunt them proceed up a considerable distance on the course of the stream in their and then float silently down with the current gun in hand and secure the birds before they become aware of being approached otherwise if the birds attention is attracted they are said to with such rapidity that it is almost an impossibility to secure them but by remaining perfectly quiet in the they are easily approached and killed around the shore of i s sound this duck is not common in spring very rarely as a and only along the streams flowing into this body of water when the young are ready to take wing â during august or from the last of july until september â they become more and more common on the rocky portions of the shore the same and often joining in flocks of the i have generally found them thus associated or themselves upon the projecting rocks and at low tide during this season they are used by the natives of the interior as toys the bird being stuffed with moss and decorated with and bright colored threads to serve as for the children their handsomely the eyes of the savages of steamer in the ocean the is also found along the shore of and visits all the sea islands during the summer it was not seen by us however in the during the of the and if it occurs there it must be as a or very rare summer old duck everywhere around the islands of sea and the coast extending through the straits and along both the and shores to the farthest limit of land this peculiar duck is found in abundance it is a noisy bird in spring with a loud and note and occurs everywhere on the sea among the drifting ice or on shore in secluded pools and small streams it occurs as a resident on the fur seal islands and upon the chain it was also seen about saint island during our visits there in june and july and was common at east cape as well as along the north coast of this land it is reported as being a common species at by and a recent letter in the new york herald from the of the reports them common august on island one of the group as the party were making their way to the mouth of the after losing their vessel its habits are a combination of the salt and fresh water ducks in as it appears to frequent indifferently the rocky islands surrounded by the sea with an entire lack of fresh water or is found far up the where fresh water alone exists it has a peculiar and rather musical note making it one of the most conspicuous birds on the and streams of the sea coast and about the mouth of the where in spring it loud cries and lively manners make it a very amusing and interesting bird it arrives in the sea with the first in the ice during april each spring or in earlier seasons the last of march these ducks are very much at this date but gradually regain their flesh until in may the open on shore and them to seek their grounds in the autumn they remain until the sea over and thus their only means of gaining after which they are forced to depart for the south s the present i i widely distributed over the of sea on both the as well as about all the islands of this water it was found merely as a upon the fur seal islands by but is extremely numerous on the chain in winter where it occurs as a very abundant resident at 
48,this season joining sometimes in flocks with the king us that it pairs early in may and upon the chain the larger number however pass farther north at this season during my visit to in may these birds were found in small numbers scattered over the inner but were extremely shy and notwithstanding repeated efforts to secure them they invariably took flight long before my approach within they have been reported as in great abundance upon island and as in large numbers on the north coast of during the summer north along the coast of sound they are only known as each fall just before the inner over in october a number of these birds are found sometimes in considerable flocks feeding about the tide and at this season i secured a number of specimens but no were ever noted at this locality and i do not know of the bird s occurrence in spring although it may be taken as a rare it was not noted by us anywhere along the coast of from saint michael s north through strait but we found a number of them the first of july in the on saint island where they were evidently breeding and again on the north coast of they were excessively numerous flocks of thousands were found about during our stay there the first of august and in company with an equal number of king and a few of the pacific were seen passing out and in each evening to and from the large back of the native village this village was built upon the spit cutting this from the sea at this of steamer in the ocean place and lay directly in the track of flight followed by these as they passed to or from the sea as these flocks passed back and forth the birds were being continually brought down by the thrown into the midst of the passing birds by the natives yet ta g this the birds continued from day to day the entire season to pass and this place their in this respect may be accounted for from the fact that these people were without guns of any kind and were thus unable to frighten them by the noise of the discharge the birds were easily called from their course of flight as we repeatedly observed if a flock should be passing a hundred yards or more to one side the natives would utter a long peculiar and the flock would turn instantly to one side and sweep by in a circuit thus affording the opportunity for bringing down some of their number these flocks generally contained a mixture of about one twentieth of the number pacific and the remainder about equally divided of and the king at times the entire community of these birds which made this vicinity their haunt would pass out in a solid body and the flock thus formed in size anything of the kind i ever witnessed the first night of our arrival was calm and misty the water having that peculiar seen at such times and the landscape indistinct at a short distance by a slight soon after we came to anchor before the native village this body of birds arose from the a mile or two beyond the natives huts and came streaming out in a flock which endless it was fully three to four miles in length and considering the species which made up this gathering of birds it was enough to make an enthusiastic wild with a desire to possess some of the beautiful specimens which were seen by within of the vessel a little later in the evening the natives brought off a considerable number of the birds which they had killed with their and during our stay at this place the following day we saw large numbers of them killed with these implements and a few were obtained with our guns this portion of the coast appears to be the grand summer resort of this as the islands form its ground one of the remarkable facts in the history of its distribution however is shown in its total absence on the opposite american coast of the where the surroundings appear to be almost identical with those found on the shore yet for all the thousands of these birds seen on this latter coast not one was noted on the american shore although the king occurs equally numerous upon both sides of the â along the shore of the sea from the mouth of the north to the head of sound the present bird is a rather common and in some places abundant summer resident and its young along the borders of the numerous pools which are found so abundantly in the low land of this region it was not seen elsewhere during the of the and it is doubtful if it ever reaches the shores of the ocean although it may occur occasionally about sound records it as rarely at and we learn from him that it is a rather rare and very shy winter early in may to its breeding grounds to the north the southern limit of its winter is unknown and from the known range of this species at present it appears to be one of the most narrowly limited of our sea fowl even having a territory than is covered by the goose which with it in a great portion of its range september when we were approaching saint michael s and about twenty five miles off the outer end of s island in sound a large flock of these were seen consisting almost entirely of they were in fall with the dark much more extended than in spring and appearing considerably different from the bird as seen then but readily by the large white patch surrounding the eye unlike the common of the north v the do not pass the most of their time at sea during the 
49,ling season but keep near their mates the and tide along the shore until the young are op steamer in the ocean v gray this species of is found everywhere about the shores and islands of sea and nests throughout nearly all this range while at island near the eastern end of the chain the middle of may considerable numbers of these birds were found upon the and exposed rocks they were then in numbers as we were told by the that they visit this portion of the territory in greatest abundance during the winter season as is well known the range of this extends from its highest northern point south to the islands off san and perhaps still farther to the south mr reports them as abundantly at and breeding in large numbers along the western portion of the chain during the summer at bay on the shore june a few pairs were seen and again the first of july at east cape it was found along the entire shore from bay around through the straits and nests nearly to cape north as previously mentioned it was joined with the king and duck in the immense flocks of these birds which were the of the river near cape but the present species was very decidedly in the a few of these birds were also found at point on august and thence south along the coast they were found much less numerous than the king until sound is reached and thence south along the coast of the king is replaced almost entirely during the summer by the present species the last of august as we left point hope and were between that place and strait several of these passed us on their way south showing that the very early in tlie season with them this species is said to be extremely abundant on the north coast of british america especially between the mouths of the and rivers where it is said to occur in greatest numbers from the western limit of that portion of the the strait region west to and the north atlantic the common duck is found the pacific on it nests in colonies and the hunters of that sea credit the females with stealing eggs from one another the male bird is said to remain in the vicinity and watches while the female sits upon the eggs giving the alarm at the approach of any danger the king the king is found in great abundance along the islands during winter some remaining to breed and thence north in summer along the coast of sea and the shore of although so numerous on the coast in summer yet on the sea coast of it is a very rare bird only as a among the large number of secured by me during my residence at saint michael s not a single individual this bird was obtained although it was well known to the natives and reported by them as being seen occasionally while they were seal hunting far ofl shore after strait is passed however following along the north shore in the to point the king is found to be very abundant becoming more and more numerous the farther north we reached until along the stretch of coast between icy cape and point we found them in large flocks in the summer of off cape of the strait large numbers of these birds were seen on july and they were again found various points along that coast where we touched n reports it as at but as being more numerous on the shores of august as the was making her way towards island a number of these birds were seen sitting upon the ice and remained gazing at the vessel until she op win in the ocean approached within fifty or sixty yards when they off into the water and took wing again the next morning as we landed at the mouth of the river on island a female with her young swam away from the beach and passed out of sight around the adjacent point thus proving that the bird nests upon this land at cape august the same summer the natives brought off to us large numbers of these birds which they killed with as described under the s this latter species with the king formed the main body of the great flocks of which were continually passing and during the time of our stay at that place at point on august they were also in great abundance and appeared to have the same habit as observed at of flying to and from the sea across the low sandy spit separating the bay at the point from the sea a rich american along the coast of sea this species nests in considerable numbers wherever the low character of the coast affords it proper ground it occurs upon saint island and thence north through strait to the shores of sound in the s nd upon the coast of mainly south of strait in the islands it is a common winter resident but is not known to breed there velvet like the preceding this bird is rather numerous along the coast of sound but occurs mainly in autumn after the breeding season is finished it is not found so commonly as the american in this region but probably passes farther to the north it was seen in the vicinity of sound during the of the and across the to the shore where at cape on august a considerable number of these birds were seen upon the rocks at the points of the cape later in the summer as we south along the shore of from strait quite a number of these birds with the last named species were seen in the sea off shore a month earlier in the season none had been seen at this point but these birds were probably those which had on shore at these 
49,points and were now returning to their usual habits of the sea this species is also found at where obtained specimens in october and at the last of may they were quite ous there and i secured several individuals during my stay at that place the surf duck this is perhaps the least common of the on the shores of sea but occurs rather commonly in the vicinity of saint michael s sound every autumn and again in spring a number of individuals were seen off the coast of the last of august as we passed out of the in the it was also seen with the preceding species on the rocks at cape the st of august and several times along the american shore of the in autumn it was not observed by me during the breeding season at the mouth in nor in the vicinity of saint michael s but as its eggs were obtained by in the vicinity of it undoubtedly the entire coast thence north in its breeding range american records several specimens killed on december at in the outer bay after a storm and states that it cannot be considered as more than an accidental visitor although it is of steamer in the reported to be common in winter at the seal islands this is probably an error as makes no of this l have not observed this species anywhere along the or and it must be exceedingly rare upon the former coast as the natives were unable to give me any information concerning it notwithstanding repeated inquiries made both at the month and in the vicinity of saint michael s nor was it observed anywhere at the various points we landed both on the and the american of sea and the during the of the fish duck this is the commonest species of upon both shores of sea it nests upon saint island and along both the american and on the former coast it is common and in many places is an abundant bird it has also been taken upon the islands by who secured specimens at along the coast of the to point it is also found in varying abundance although we did not observe it on the coast of the during the summer of yet its known distribution on the adjoining shores and islands would indicate that it is found there as well tes a single large flock of this handsome bird was seen by mr in the vicinity of saint michael s in october just before the harbor became frozen over this is the only record i possess of the occurrence of this bird in the waters of sea it was not seen by us during the of the on either shore and as not a single example was observed during my residence at saint michael s the species is undoubtedly extremely rare on the western coast of violet green this handsomely colored is the commonest of its kind along the chain and about the shores of the various islands in sea visiting both shores in addition wherever the coast a bold rocky character affording the birds suitable places it is found on the islands in strait and thence extends through into the being found upon both shores there as in sea it is not numerous in the vicinity of saint michael s and the mouth mainly owing to the low character of the coast but towards the head of sound it nests in large numbers upon the bold cliffs the sea in that vicinity at bay during our visits in june and july these birds were very numerous and were noted at various other points along the coast on june scattered individuals of a species of to which i refer this bird were seen in the sea off cape but none were secured a species of either this or the following was seen at herald island and again one or two individuals near island and on the american shore in the vicinity of cape on july but as they were shy at all these no specimens were secured and it was impossible to ascertain definitely to which species they should be referred pall red faced records the capture of several of these birds at north cape where they were upon the cliffs in large numbers at the time of the s visit there on september op steamer ts the s this is au extremely bird over all the deep water portions of sea extending into the ocean to the vicinity of the ice pack it rarely visits the eastern shore of the sea however from the mouth of the north to the head of sound the shallow and muddy character of the water here apparently not being suitable for the presence of food upon which this bird exists on the western shore of the sea in the vicinity of bay and saint island thence north through strait the bird was found in the g abundance during the visit of the to that region it was also abundant north beyond the straits along the shore the shallow character of the water on the american coast north of the straits had the same effect in not presenting suitable ground for these wide birds tells us that the common which is the north atlantic representative of the bird under consideration at present is much more common on bear island and than it is upon it abundantly on bear island on some of the sloping cliffs not difficult of access one case is mentioned where on may the eggs were seen deposited directly upon the bare ice which covered the rocks at the time in one place a bird was found frozen fast by one leg as it sat upon the eggs in august as recorded by one of the old dutch which that coast on the northern part of found some upon a piece of ice covered with a little earth in both 
49,of these cases the of the egg during could not be warmed above the point during the of the in sea and the it was observed that on some days s would be seen in large numbers and again in passing over the same area not a single individual would be noticed these birds breed on the islands of sea and i am inclined to think some nest upon herald island in the ocean although in our hasty visit to that island none were seen yet the cliffs on the side opposite our landing were eminently suitable for places such as these delight to choose and the abundance of the bird up to within a comparatively short distance of this land rendered the supposition probable found them breeding in greatest abundance upon the fur seal islands where he secured their eggs as we approached the harbor of on september hundreds of these birds were seen in the ordinary light colored which were in company with about an equal number of birds either of the same species or a closely related one of exactly the same size which were clad in a brown or brown both birds were sitting in the water in immense flocks covering acres and as we among them they appeared totally unable to rise the vessel almost running down numerous individuals as they along the surface of the water trying to rise the perfectly calm sea at the time apparently rendered the birds almost helpless mr suggests that the dark colored birds seen at that time were the slender may be the case but if so it shows that these birds exist in large numbers in the north although they have not been secured by the numerous who have visited that region a number of these dark birds were also seen north of strait on two occasions and undoubtedly be referred to the same species as those seen in the vicinity of of which unfortunately no specimens were secured aud there is but a single record of this bird s capture on the coast of this was at sound whence mr secured a single skin during his in the territory â several times during our in the in the summer of a dark colored was seen in company with the common species and of about the same size this may perhaps be of steamer win in the ocean the slender i although it was impossible to identify them since no specimens were secured as we approached in september large numbers of dark were also seen in company with the common species but then as before it was impossible to secure specimens the intensity of the dark in many of these specimens seemed to the idea of their being to s and it is to be hoped that any visiting the territory hereafter may pay especial attention to securing some of these birds and thus settle the for if these dark colored birds were the slender species it must be a very common bird notwithstanding its having escaped the notice of every who has visited the territory within the last ten or fifteen years s these birds are very numerous in the vicinity of the islands but are soon lost sight of when these islands are left in passing to the north south from these islands they occur over the entire pacific from the chain to san they are yet unknown even north to the seal islands although they undoubtedly reach that group occasionally the f as we left the islands on our way to san in october and thence on for several hundred miles a large black was repeatedly seen the size of this bird would indicate that it was the species mentioned above although no specimens were secured it was repeatedly seen in company with s and the species and excellent opportunities were afforded for judging of its relative size this elegant is found over all sea reaching saint michael s and about the head of s sound as well as strait it was found on some in the middle of pass near by mr and is numerous along the entire chain to the north the bird is less and less abundant the farther one goes and perhaps never to the side of strait several specimens were secured in the vicinity of saint michael s during my residence there and they are well known to the natives who find them while they are seal hunting far off shore the birds rarely coming close to the coast these are among the most beautiful of the the delicate shade of the entire and the bird s graceful motions are marked even among this group of birds for their grace and elegance upon the wing white from the time we left the islands in october until we were eight or nine hundred miles distant to the south scarcely a day passed but a with the white and answering closely in all its to the description given of this bird was seen about they were frequently quite close to the vessel and were carefully examined with glasses and peculiar were such as to distinguish them from the other almost as far as they could be seen they were in company with other and appeared less numerous than any of the other species h ex of in the ocean american red these are quite numerous along the entire american coast of sea and breeding from the of to the vicinity of the straits are most numerous however in autumn when they are found the sea and some years from ten to a dozen specimens may be secured while in others but one or two will be seen it is unknown from the islands and the shore of this sea and the only portion of the coast of which i have proof of its occurrence is in sound where it also nests in summer like the preceding this bird is found all 
49,along the shore of this sea where however it very being mainly an inland species it is found quite frequently in the interior where it nests and visits the sea coast during the it is also found on the shore of sound but is not known from the islands of this sea nor the coast col the this bird is found along the sea coast on both sides and also upon the shore of the breeding wherever found it is not abundant in this region neither is it rare there is no record of its occurrence upon any of the islands of this sea although as noted it occurs on both shores gray great white this bird the largest of the has a distribution although it is not known to occur in abundance at any locality it is found breeding about sound whence the natives brought me several specimens and reported the bird to be rather common there in summer i secured a young bird at saint michael s in autumn and it is known to occur on the shore there is no record of its presence about the sea islands but like the other species of it undoubtedly visits these islands during the at least the difficulty of studying the birds which frequent the sea about these storm beaten islands is apparent and accounts for the little progress which can be made in the full number of species which are found in their vicinity black this bird is found everywhere along the shore of sea on the american coast and is very abundant along the shore from the of north to sound it was also seen in strait the first of july and noted on several occasions along the shore where it also it has not been recorded from the islands of this sea although undoubtedly there in the this bird is very rare on the coast of sea among the large number of black secured by me only one proves to belong to this bird and the same proportion is found to hold good with other which have been brought m that country specimen was op steamer in the ocean taken at saint s the of probably holds good for all the sea red this bird is present in about equal numbers with the black species and is extremely familiar its loud note and peculiar habits like that of the other rendering it well known to any one who becomes familiar with the of the north it nests abundantly all along the coast from the of to sound extending across the sea to the shore but is not known from the islands of this sea although it undoubtedly occurs there gray this is one of the most common birds found in sea it nests abundantly all along the chain and upon all the rocky of this sea as well as almost every rocky cape which projects along the coast line it was seen by us in small numbers off cape on june and a few were noted at east cape the first of july at herald island a single specimen was seen and in the vicinity of cape and cape on the american shore a few were seen but tbey were not abundant island a small rocky in bay sound is literally alive with these birds which cover the rocks as they perch along the slope of the rocky shore while visiting this a bird was seen coming in from the sea carrying four in its mouth the fish were placed in the bill and the bird looked very odd as it came swiftly along with the fish so held it flew directly to a in the rocks and disappeared while walking over the island the growling and noises made by the birds is distinctly heard and the entire ground appears to be alive with them the representative of this bird in the north atlantic the large n in small numbers about the end of and on which with the record firom herald island forms the we concerning their distribution pall these birds are very common all along the chain and thence north to strait they are however much less abundant in nearly every place than their relative the which has the same distribution a few of the present species were seen at cape on the coast of the july but they were far more scarce than the other species they were also seen oft cape the last of june and again at east cape the first of july the same proportion was found to hold in sound so it is evident that this bird is a more southern species than its relative pall these odd birds are very common in sea from the islands north breeding in great abundance upon the fur seal group and all the other islands of this sea they also swarm by thousands about the and other islands of strait besides along the shore where at bay we found them in the greatest abundance they were also seen off cape on june it rarely extends its range beyond the straits however on august while on an excursion to the head of bay we secured quite a number of these birds and in every case found them with the small which in of steamer in the ocean the water there they were extremely here as well as all along this portion of the coast their oddly shaped bill is well adapted for the with which the waters in this region though it would not answer the purpose for opening as suggested by some of the older authors early in july it was found upon the islands and its eggs were secured it lays but a single one which is white and about the size of that of a pigeon pall like the preceding species this bird is extremely numerous in sea but like the latter prefers those portions of the sea in which the 
50,water is very deep and cold hence along the shore the birds are rare but upon the islands and the fur seal group the in strait and the shore north through the straits they are very numerous like bees around a hive over the steep rocky islands which are found in these waters several of these birds were seen in the vicinity of herald island during our visit there but they appeared to be very rare as compared with the and at island also on august and others were seen but only two or three individuals in all these birds are found along the chain but are not known from the islands to the north of that and were not observed by us during the of the the habits and distribution of this species are little known and it did not fall under my observation during the time of my residence at saint michael s nor upon either of my visits to the islands least these birds are extremely abundant breeding by millions along the chain and upon all the other islands of sea thence north to strait rarely however upon the american coast but found very commonly along the shore a pair were seen august off icy on the coast of which is the farthest northern record known of this small species a few were seen off on june and these two records are all we have of their presence in the this is another species on the islands which however was not noted by us during the of the and whose range does not extend far if any into sea beyond the immediate vicinity of these islands gin this is also a species in the islands which did not fall under our notice however more or less commonly there this is an extremely abundant species throughout the islands where it and extends its range northward along the west coast of sea to strait it was found â ery numerous during our visits to bay and thence along the shore to the straits but was not observed to north of this latter point b op steamer in the s this extremely rare bird was observed by me at in the spring of where i secured a single specimen in the breeding it was also taken towards the western end of this chain by mr a few years later and with these two specimens ends the known history of this species on these islands up to the present date black these birds occur throughout sea and are numerous they extend their range also well into the reaching herald and islands and specimens were noted by the of the who records them in the vicinity of those islands discovered during the made by the people of that vessel in that portion of the north of the atlantic the black is found breeding north to in some cases although it is more numerous south of this it was found with s in â east by during his voyage during the drift of the it was seen passing to the westward on may and at various other places was observed upon island it was found iu great numbers the th of july on april it was found in about latitude â â during its residence in these high it is reported to feed upon the small tom which the of the reports to have seen the bird kill by beating them upon the water and shaking them in their bills these birds were quite numerous at herald island as we approached through the ice on the th of july flock after flock of them joined with the came oft towards the when we were making a landing large numbers of them were seen bringing fish from three to four inches in length to their young and as the waters surrounding this island were seen to swarm with there appeared to be an abundance of food pigeon this is the most abundant of the small throughout the north from the islands to those of and herald where we found it breeding abundantly during our visit there on the we found it near cape where it was and also in great abundance upon island where it was perhaps the most abundant bird present tea the it was also upon east the islands and along the entire portion of the coast wherever and slopes occurred the sea none was observed on the western portion of the new islands by but the reported it to him as at wherever open water was found during that season these birds are found along the pacific coast reaching to the islands beyond which it is uncertain how far their range extends they were not observed by us during the of the in the although among the millions of which breed upon the g on the shores of this sea both north and south of strait it is very probable they may occur thick this bird occurs in greatest abundance throughout sea and the portions ox the reaching herald and islands where we found it breeding by thousands of in the ocean the bird also occurs along both shores of sea in the greatest numbers wherever cliffs afford proper at of strait we found it in large numbers just off shore and again at east on the rocky faces of the cliffs as well as upon the islands in the middle of the straits it was rather scarce however among the islands in sound on july as we drew near herald island on the this bird became more and more abundant about us or in small parties and singly among loose blocks of ice sometimes standing upon the ice or sitting upright near its edge flocks came swinging about us in circles apparently filled with curiosity at the strange apparition breaking in upon

general level to publish its wealth no great valley or lake is seen or river or group of well marked features of any kind standing out in distinct pictures even the summit peaks so clear and high in

of from to feet in which once flowed majestic and in which now flow and sing a band of beautiful rivers though of such depth these famous are not raw gloomy jagged walled savage and inaccessible with rough passages here the of and there they still make delightful for the conducting from the fertile to the highest icy fountains as a kind of mountain streets full of charming life and light and by

lofty retiring walls infinitely varied in form and are fringed with plants of many species oaks and which find on a thousand narrow steps and benches while the whole is and made glorious with

besides forming the scattered a heavy shower over the woods for miles to a depth of from six inches to several feet the history of this last is also preserved in the traditions of the river indians

blood less recent in great the adjacent region some of them with lakes in their throats others overgrown with trees and flowers nature in these old and having literally given beauty for ashes on the side of mount there is a the mountains of about feet below the summit which has been active subsequent to the breaking up of the main ice cap that once covered the mountain as is shown by its comparatively and the streams of from it the main summit is about a mile and a half in bounded by small crumbling peaks and among which we seek in vain for the outlines of the ancient these masses and the deep that the sides of the mountain show that it has been considerably lowered and wasted by ice how much we have no sure means of knowing just below the extreme summit hot and issue from in mixed with spray derived from melting snow the last feeble expression of the mighty force that built the mountain not in one great was given birth the of the summit and the sections exposed by the down the

mountain with alternate haste and deliberation succeeded till the old surpassed even its present sublime height standing on the icy top of this the of all the fire mountains of the we can hardly fail to look forward to its next gardens homes have been planted on the of which after remaining stead the mountains of fast for ages have suddenly blazed into violent action and poured forth overwhelming floods of fire it is known that more than a thousand years of cool calm have between violent like gigantic rock instead of water work and rest and we have no e means of knowing whether they are dead when still or only sleeping along the western base of the range a telling series of i containing the early history of the are now being studied but leaving for the present these first chapters we see that only a very short time ago just before coming on of that winter of called the period a vast of rocks poured from many a chasm and on the and of the range filling lake and river channels and nearly eveiy existing feature on the northern portion at length these all destroying floods ceased to flow but while the great built up along the still burned and smoked the whole passed under the domain of ice and snow then over the bald blackened mountains began to crawl covering them from the to the sea with a mantle of ice and then with deliberation the work went on of the range anew these mighty agents of halting never through centuries crushed and gi the and gi beneath their folds wasting and building in the of time the a was 
51,bom again brought to light nearly as we behold it to the day with and snow crushed pines at the top of the range wheat fields and orange groves at the foot of it this change from icy darkness and death to life and beauty was slow as we count time and is still going on north and south over all the world wherever exist whether in the form of distinct rivers as in the mountains of asia and the pacific coast or in continuous folds as in portions of joseph land and the lands about the south pole but in no country as far as i know may these majestic changes be studied to better advantage than in the plains and mountains of toward the close of the period when the snow clouds became less fertile and the melting waste of became gi the lower folds of the ice sheet in of into the sea began to shallow and from the and then move slowly up the of the in compliance with the changes of climate the great white mantle on the mountains broke up into a series of more or less distinct and river like

magnitude of the work done on these mountains during the last period by which are only streams of closely snow careful study of the phenomena presented goes to show that the pre condition of the range was comparatively simple one vast wave of stone in which a thousand mountains etc lay concealed and in the development of these nature chose for a tool not the earthquake or lightning to and split asunder not the stormy torrent or rain but the tender noiselessly falling through centuries the offspring of the sun and sea laboring in united strength they and ground and wore away the rocks in their march making vast beds of soil and at the same time de the and fashioned the into the delightful variety of hill and and mountain that mortals call beauty perhaps more than a mile in average depth has the range been thus the last period â a quantity of mechanical work almost great and our must be excited again and again as we toil and study and learn that this vast job of so far reaching in its influences was done by agents so fragile and small as are these flowers of the mountain clouds strong only by force of numbers they carried away entire mountains by block by block and cast them into the sea ed fashioned all the range and developed its beauty all these new were evidently for the physical structure of the rocks on which the features of the scenery depend was acquired while they lay at least a mile deep below the pre surface and it was while these features were taking form in the depths of the range the of the rocks marching to their appointed places in the dark with reference to the coming beauty that the of icy in the sky marching to the same music assembled to bring them to the light then after their gi and task was done these bands of snow flowers these mighty were melted and removed as if of no more importance than dew destined to last but an hour few however of e s agents have left monuments so noble and enduring as they the gi eat granite a mile high the as deep the noble peaks the valleys these and indeed the mountains of nearly all other features of the scenery are monuments contemplating the works of these flowers of the sky one may easily fancy them endowed with life messengers sent down to work in the mountain mines on errands of divine love silently flying through the darkened to their appointed places they seem to have taken counsel together saying come we ai e feeble let us help one another we are many and together we will be strong marching in close deep ranks let us roll away the stones from these mountain and set the free let us these here let us a lake basin there a valley here a channel for a river with steps and brows for the plunge of yonder let us spread broad sheets of soil that man and beast may be fed and here pile trains of for pines and giant here make ground for a meadow there for a garden and grove making it smooth and fine for small and and beds of it well with and thus and so on it has seemed to me sang and planned and labored the hearty snow flower and nothing that i can write can possibly the grandeur and beauty of their work like morning mist they have vanished in sunshine all save the few small companies that still linger on the and as are still busily at work the last of the lake the 
51,last beds of soil and the of some of the highest peaks chapter ii the of the small mentioned in the preceding chapter i have found sixty five in that portion of the range lying between latitude and

the ocean to the mountains as strikingly shows the number of in the according to the brothers is of which may be regarded as and the total area of ice snow and is estimated at square miles or an average for each of uttle more than one square mile on the same authority the average height above sea level at which they melt is about feet the below feet and one of the reaches nearly as low a point one of the largest of the on the head waters of the does not according to captain descend below feet the largest of the on mount to within feet of the level of the sea which as far as i have observed is the lowest point reached by any within the bounds of the average height of all being not far from feet the changes that have taken place in the conditions of the from the time of greatest

something of the changes that have taken place in and will throw light on the of the high prior to the autumn of the of the were unknown in october of that year i discovered the black mountain in a shadowy between black and red mountains two of the peaks of the group this group is the highest portion of a spur that out from the main of the range in the direction of valley at the time of this interesting discovery i was exploring the of the group and tracing the courses of the ancient that once poured from its ample fountains through the basin and the the valley not expecting to find any

time consumed in their study the monuments of the that ed its ice from between red and black mountains i found to be the most interesting of them all and when i saw its magnificent extending in majestic cm from the between the mountains i 
51,was with the work that lay before me it was one of the golden days of the indian summer when the rich sunshine every landscape however rocky and cold and suggests anything rather than s the path of the vanished was warm now and shone in many places as if washed with silver the tall pines gi owing on the stood in the glowing light the gi on the of the basin were masses of orange yellow and the added gold to gold pushing on over my rosy highway i passed lake after lake set in solid of granite and many a thicket and meadow watered by a stream that issues from the and links the lakes together now through knee deep in yellow and now passing over bare rock the main that bounded the view on either hand are from to nearly feet high and about as regular as artificial em the mountains of and covered with a superb growth of silver fir and pine but this garden and forest was speedily left behind the trees were as i ascended patches of the and began to appear and pressed into flat carpets by the winter snow the which a few miles down the valley were so richly embroidered with meadows had here at an elevation of feet only small brown of leaving bare rocks around more than half their shores yet amid this the mountain pine bravely tossed his storm beaten branches on the and of red mountain some specimens being over feet high and feet in seemingly as fresh and vigorous as the giants of the lower evening came on just as i got fairly within the of the main it is about a mile wide and a little less than two miles long the crumbling spurs and of red mountain bound it on the north the rudely of black on the south and a around from mountain to mountain it in on the east i chose a gi on the brink of one of the lakes where a thicket of sheltered me from the night wind then after making a tin of tea i sat by my camp fire reflecting on the grandeur and significance of the records i had seen as the night advanced the mighty rock walls of my mountain mansion seemed to come nearer while the sky in glorious brightness stretched across like a ceiling from wall the to wall and fitted closely down into all the ii of the then after a long fireside rest and a glance at my note book i cut a few leafy branches for a bed and fell into the clear death like sleep of the tired early next morning i set out to trace the grand old that had done so much for the beauty of the region back to its farthest fountains enjoying the charm that every feels in nature s the voices of the mountains were still asleep the wind scarce stirred the pine needles the sun was up but it was yet too cold for the birds and the few owing animals that dwell here only the stream from pool to pool seemed to be wholly awake yet the spirit of the opening day called to action the came streaming through the jagged of the glancing on the and lighting the silvery lakes while eveiy sun touched rock burned white on its edges like melting iron in a furnace passing round the north shore of my camp lake i followed the

mountains of of tons in weight are left here and there out in the middle of the channel here also i observed a series of small ranged along the south wall of the corresponding in size and form with the shadows cast by the highest portions the meaning of this between and shadows was afterward made plain tracing the stream back to the last of its chain of i noticed a deposit of fine gray mud on the bottom except where the force of the entering current had prevented its settling it looked like the mud worn from a and i at once suspected its origin for the stream that was carrying it came out

structure of the ice the uppermost or where the was attached to the mountain was from to feet wide and was in a few places the by the remains of snow creeping along the edge of the holding on with fingers i discovered clear sections where the structure was beautifully revealed the surface snow though sprinkled with stones shot down from the cliffs was in some places almost pure gradually becoming and changing to ice of different shades of color and this again changing at a depth of or feet to blue ice some of the ribbon like bands of which were nearly pure and blended with

delicious music of the water and the lovely light coming again to the surface i noticed of every size on their journeys to the â journeys of more than a hundred years without a single stop night or day winter or summer the sun gave birth to a of sweet that ran gracefully down the curling and in their shining channels and cut the mountains of ting clear sections through the surface ice into the solid blue where the structure of the was beautifully illustrated the series of small which i had observed in the morning along the south wall of the correspond in every way with the of this and their distribution with reference to shadows was now understood when the changes came on that caused the melting and retreat of the main that filled the a series of were left in the cliff shadows under the protection of which they lingered until they formed the w are studying then as the snow became still less abundant all of them vanished in succession except the one just described and the cause of its longer life is sufficiently apparent in the greater area of snow basin it and its more perfect protection from wasting sunshine how much longer this little will last depends of course on the amount of snow it receives from year to year as compared with melting waste after this discovery i made excursions over all the high pushing my summer after summer and discovered that what at first sight in the distance looked like extensive were in great part busily at work the of the summit peaks so blocked out by their giant on august i set a series of in the near mount and found its rate of motion to be little more than an inch a day in the middle showing a great contrast to the the in which near the front flows at a rate of from five to ten feet in twenty four hours mount has three but mount

evidence of motion its sides however are and polished in many places by the action of its ancient that flowed east and west as of the great that once filled the valleys of the and s rivers chapter iii

light covering mostly from the slopes exposed to the sun and causes but little apprehension on the part of who may be lingering among the high peaks at this time the first general winter storm that snow that is to form a lasting portion of the season s supply seldom breaks on the mountains before the end of november then warned by the sky cautious together with the wild sheep deer and most of the birds and bears make haste to the or foot hills and owing mountain and such people go into winter quarters some of them not again to see the light of day until the general awakening and of the spring in june or july the first heavy fall is usually from about two to four feet in depth then with intervals of splendid sunshine storm storm snow on snow until thirty to fifty feet has fallen but on account of its settling and compact the snow ing and the almost constant waste from melting and the average depth actually found at any time seldom ten feet in the forest region or fifteen feet along the slopes of the summit peaks even during the weather never wholly ceases and the sunshine that between the storms is sufficiently powerful to melt the surface more or less through all the winter months waste from melting also goes on to some extent on the bottom from heat stored up in the and given slowly to the snow in contact with them as is shown by the rising of the streams on all the higher regions after the first and their steady sustained flow all winter the gi portion of the snow deposited around the lofty of the range falls in small crisp and broken or when accompanied by strong winds and low temperature the instead of being locked together in their fall to form are beaten and broken into meal and fine dust but down in the forest region the greater portion comes gently

during the progress of gentle storms is loaded with fairy bloom at the and darkest time of year bending the branches and every singing needle but as soon as the storm is over and the sun shines the snow at once begins to shift and settle and fall from the in the mountains of miniature and the white forest soon becomes green again the snow on the ground also 
52,settles and every bright day and at night until it becomes and loses every trace of its structure and then a man may walk firmly over its frozen surface as if on ice the forest region up to an elevation of feet is usually in great part free from snow in june but at this time the regions are still heavy laden and are not touched by spring weather to any considerable extent before the middle or end of july one of the most striking effects of the snow on the mountains is the burial of the rivers and small lakes as the fa s in the river a moment white then lost forever sang in the fleeting character of human pleasure the first that fall into the rivers vanish thus suddenly but in great storms when the temperature is low the abundance of the snow at length the water nearly to the point and then of course it ceases to melt and the snow so suddenly the falling and form cloud like masses of blue which are swept forward with the current and carried down to warmer many miles distant while some are lodged against logs and rocks and projecting points of the banks and last for days piled high above the level of the water and show white again instead of being at once lost forever while the rivers themselves the snow are at length lost for months during the the snow is first built out from the banks in over curling and until the streams are they then flow in the dark beneath a continuous covering across the snowy which is about thirty miles wide all the rivers and their in these high regions are thus lost every winter as if another period had come on not a drop of running water is to be seen excepting at a few points where large falls though the rush and of the heavier currents may still be heard toward spring when the weather is warm during the day and frosty at night repeated and and new of snow render the masses dense and firm so that one may safely walk across the streams or even lead a horse across them without danger of falling through in june the parts of the winter ceiling and those most exposed to sunshine begin to give way forming dark rugged edged pit like sinks at the bottom of which the rushing water may be seen at the end of june only here and there may the find a e snow bridge the most lasting of the winter bridges from below as well as from above because of wai m currents of air passing through the are strikingly arched and and by the occasional of the dripping water of the they become brightly and icy in some of the reaches where there is a free margin we may walk through them small appearing here and there these are not very dark the the mountains of roaring river fills all the way with loud music which is at times by the a bird that is not afraid to go wherever a stream may go and to sing wherever a stream sings all the small pools and are in like manner from the winter either by being first frozen and then covered by snow or by being filled in by the first of the season shot into a lake basin may perhaps find the sm face frozen then there is a grand crashing of breaking ice and dashing of waves mingled with the low deep of the detached masses of the snow mixed with fragments of ice drift about in island like heaps while the main body of it forms a with its base wholly or in part resting on the bottom of the basin as controlled by its depth and the size of the the next of course still farther and so on with each in succession until the entire basin may be filled and its water up or this huge mass of more or less mixed with sand stones and perhaps timber is frozen to a considerable depth and much sun heat is required to it some of these unfortunate are not clear of ice and snow until near the end of summer others are never quite free opening only on the side opposite the entrance of the some show only a narrow of water lying between the shore and sheer of icy snow masses of which breaking off float in front like in a miniature ocean while the the snow heaps leaning back against the mountains look like small the cliffs are in some instances quite picturesque and with the waters in front of them lighted with sunshine are exceedingly beautiful it often that while one side of a lake basin is hopelessly snow buried and frozen the other enjoying sunshine is adorned with beautiful flower gardens some of the smaller lakes are extinguished in an instant by a heavy either of rocks or snow the sliding ponderous mass entering on one side sweeps across the bottom and up the op i side the water and even the basin clean and the accumulated rocks and up the farther bank and taking full possession the water is in part absorbed but most of it is sent around the front of the and down the channel of the outlet roaring and hurrying as if frightened and glad to escape snow the most magnificent storm phenomenon i ever saw surpassing in gi the most imposing effects of clouds floods or was the peaks of the high back of valley decorated with snow many of the snow flowers out of which these are made fall before they are ripe while most of those that do attain perfect development as six and against one another in their fall through the frosty air and are broken into the of fragments this dry snow is still farther prepared for the 
52,formation of by the action of the wind for instead of rest at once like the snow which falls into the depths of the forests it is rolled over and over beaten against rock and in and hollows like pebbles and sand in the pot holes of a river until finally the delicate angles of the are worn and the whole mass is reduced to dust and whenever storm winds find this prepared snow dust in a loose condition on exposed slopes where there is a free upward sweep to it is tossed back into the sky and borne onward from peak to peak in the form of or cloudy according to the of the wind and the of the slopes up or around which it is driven while thus flying through the air a small portion makes good its escape and remains in the sky as but far the greater part after being driven into the sky again and again is at length locked fast in or in the of some of it to remain silent and rigid for centuries before it is finally melted and sent singing down the to the sea yet notwithstanding the abundance of winter snow dust in the mountains and the of high winds and the length of time the dust remains loose and exposed to their action the occurrence of well formed is for causes we shall hereafter note comparatively rare i have seen only one display of this kind that seemed in every way perfect this was in the winter of when the the snow snow laden were swept by a wild i happened at the time to be in valley that sublime temple where every day one may see the sights yet even here the wild day of the north wind seemed glorious i was awakened in the morning by the rocking of my cabin and the beating of pine on the roof detached torrents and from the main wind flood overhead were rushing wildly down the narrow side and over the walls with loud roar rousing the pines to enthusiastic action and the whole valley as though it were an instrument being played but afar on the lofty exposed peaks of the range standing so high in the sky the storm was expressing itself in still characters which i was soon to see in all their glory i had long been anxious to study some points in the structure of the ice that is formed every winter at the foot of the upper fall but the blinding spray by which it is invested had hitherto prevented me from making a sufficiently near approach this morning the entire body of the fall was torn into and blown along the face of the leaving the and while making my way to the top of an overlooking ledge to seize so favorable an opportunity to examine the interior of the the peaks of the group came in sight over the shoulder of the south dome each waving a banner against the blue sky as regular in form and as firm in texture as if woven of fine silk so rare and splendid a the mountains of of course all other considerations and i at once let the ice go and began to force my way out of the valley to some dome or ridge sufficiently lofty to command a general view of the main feeling assured that i should find them still more nor was i in the least disappointed indian through which i was choked with snow that had been shot down in from the high cliffs on either side rendering the ascent difficult but by the roaring storm the tedious brought no fatigue and in four hours i gained the top of a ridge above the valley feet high and there in bold relief like a clear painting appeared a most imposing scene innumerable peaks black and sharp rose into the dark blue sky their set in solid white their sides and with snow like ocean rocks with foam and from every all free and was streaming a beautiful silvery banner from half a mile to a mile in length slender at the point of attachment then gradually as it extended from the peak until it was about or feet in breadth as near as i could estimate the cluster of peaks called the crown of the at the head of the and rivers â q with their nameless â each had its own banner waving with a clearly visible motion in the and there was not a single cloud in the sky to mar their simple grandeur fancy yourself standing on this ridge looking eastward you notice a strange the snow glitter in the air the gale drives overhead with a fierce roar but its violence is not felt for you are looking through a sheltered opening in the woods as through a window there in the immediate of your picture rises a majestic forest of silver fir blooming in eternal freshness the yellow green and the snow beneath the trees strewn with their beautiful plucked off by the wind beyond and extending over all the ground are of pine interrupted by huge swelling and and just beyond the dark forest you see the of the high waving their magnificent they are twenty miles away but you would not wish them nearer for every feature is distinct and the whole glorious show is seen in its right proportions after this general view mark how the dark ribs and and of the peaks are defined excepting the portions veiled by the and how their sides are with snow where it has come to rest in narrow and mark too how gi the wave as the wind is against their sides and how each is attached to the very summit of its peak like a at a how smooth and they are in texture and how finely their fading are on the 
52,sky see how dense and they are at the point of attachment and how and toward the end so that the peaks back of them are seen dimly as though you were looking through ground glass yet again observe how some of the the mountains of longest belonging to the stream perfectly free all the way across intervening and passes from peak to peak while others and partly hide each other and consider how keenly every of this wondrous cloth of snow is flashing out of these are the main features of the beautiful and terrible picture as seen from the forest window and it would still be glorious were the fore and altogether leaving only the black peaks the white and the blue sky glancing now in a general way at the formation of snow we find that the main causes of the wondrous beauty and perfection of those we have been contemplating were the favorable direction and great force of the wind the abundance of snow dust and the peculiar of the slopes of the peaks it is essential not only that the wind should move with great and to supply a sufficiently copious and continuous stream of snow dust but that it should come from the north no perfect banner is ever hung on the peaks by a south wind had the gale that day blown from the south leaving other conditions unchanged only a dull confused fog like drift would have been produced for the snow instead of being up over the tops of the peaks in concentrated currents to be drawn out as would have been shed off around the sides and piled down into the the cause of the concentrated action of the north wind is found in the peculiar form of the north sides of the peaks where the of the the snow are in general the south sides are and irregular while the north sides are both in their and sections the wind in ascending these curves toward the carrying the snow in currents with it shooting it almost straight up into the air above the peaks from which it is then away in a direction this difference in form between the north and south sides of the peaks was almost wholly produced by the difference in the kind and quantity of the to which they have been subjected the north sides having been by shadow of a form that never existed on the sun beaten sides it appears therefore that shadows in great part determine not only the forms of lofty icy mountains but also those of the snow that the wild winds hang on them chapter iv a view of the high early one bright morning in the middle of indian summer while the meadows were still crisp with frost i set out from the foot of mount on my way down to valley to my exhausted store of bread and tea i had spent the past summer as many preceding ones exploring the that lie on the head waters of the san and s rivers measuring and studying their movements etc and the part they had played during the period of their greater extension in the creation and development of the of this the time for this kind of work was nearly over for the year and i began to look forward with delight to the approaching winter with its wondrous storms when i would be warmly snow bound in my cabin with plenty of bread and books but a tinge of regret came on when i considered that possibly i might not see this favorite region again until the next summer excepting distant views from the heights about the walls to artists few portions of the high are strictly speaking picturesque the whole massive a view of the high of the range is one great picture not into smaller ones much in this respect from the older and what may be called mountains of the coast range all the of the as we have seen were born again from base to summit by the developing of the last winter but all these new were not brought forth simultaneously some of the highest where the ice lingered longest are of younger than those of the warmer regions below them in general the younger the mountain â younger i mean with reference to the time of their from the ice of the period â the less are they into artistic bits capable of being made into warm sympathetic es with humanity in them here however on the head waters of the is a gi of wild peaks on which the may say that the sun has but just begun to shine which is yet in a high degree picturesque and in its main es so regular and balanced as almost to appear conventional â one cluster of snow laden peaks with gray granite around its base the whole free into the sky from the head of a magnificent valley whose lofty walls are away on both sides so as to embrace it all admitting anything not strictly belonging to it the was now with autumn colors brown and purple and gold ripe in the mellow sunshine brightly with the deep blue of the sky and the black and gi ay and pure the mountains of spiritual white of the rocks and down through the midst the young was seen pouring from its crystal fountains now resting in pools as if changing back again into ice now leaping in white as if turning to snow gliding right and left between gi then sweeping on through the smooth of the valley swaying from side to side with calm stately gestures past dipping and and around groves of pine and throughout its whole course whether flowing fast or slow singing loud or low ever filling the landscape with spiritual animation and the of its sources in every movement and tone pursuing my lonely 
53,way down the valley i turned again and again to gaze on the glorious picture throwing up my arms to it as in a frame after long ages of growth in the darkness beneath the through sunshine and storms it seemed now to be ready and waiting for the elected artist like yellow wheat for the and i could not help wishing that i might carry colors and with me on my travels and learn to paint in the mean time i had to be content with photographs on my mind and sketches in my note books at length after i had rounded a that puts out from the west wall of the valley eveiy peak vanished from sight and i pushed rapidly along the frozen meadows over the divide between the waters of the and and down through the forests that clothe the slopes of cloud s best arriving in in due time â which a near view of the high with me is any time and strange to say among the first people i met here were two artists who with letters of introduction were awaiting my return they inquired whether in the course of my in the adjacent mountains i had ever come upon a landscape suitable for a large painting whereupon i began a description of the one that had so lately excited my admiration then as i went on further and further into details their faces began to glow and i offered to guide them to it while they declared that they would gladly follow far or near i could spare the time to lead them since storms might come breaking down through the fine weather at any time the colors in snow and cutting off the artists retreat i advised getting ready at once i led them out of the valley by the and falls thence over the main dividing ridge to the big meadows by the old trail and thence along the upper river to its head this was my companions st excursion into the high and as i was almost always alone in my the way that the fresh beauty was reflected in their faces made for me a novel and interesting study they naturally were affected most of all by the colors â the intense of the sky the of the granite the red and of dry meadows and the purple and crimson of the flaming yellow of gi the silvery flashing of the streams and the bright green and blue of the lakes but the general the mountains of sion of the scenery â rocky and savage â seemed sadly and as they the forest from ridge to ridge eagerly the as they were unfolded they said all this is huge and sublime but we see nothing as yet at all available for effective pictures art is long and art is limited you know and here are middle gi all alike bare rock waves woods groves of meadow and of water never mind i replied only bide a and i will show you something you like at length toward the end of the second day the crown began to come into view and when we had fairly rounded the projecting before mentioned the whole picture stood revealed in the flush of the their enthusiasm was excited beyond bounds and the more impulsive of the two a young dashed ahead shouting and and tossing his arms in the air like a madman here at last was a typical landscape after awhile on the view i proceeded to make camp in a sheltered grove a little way back from the meadow where pine boughs could be obtained for beds and where there was plenty of wood for fires while the artists ran here and there along the river and up the sides of the choosing for sketches after dark when our tea was made and a rousing fire had been built we began to make our plans they decided to remain several days at the least while i con a view of the high to make an excursion in the mean time to the untouched summit of bitter it was now about the middle of october the of snow flowers the first winter clouds had already and the peaks were strewn with fresh without however affecting the climbing to any dangerous extent and as the weather was still profoundly calm and the distance to the foot of the mountain only a little more than a day i felt that i was running no great risk of being storm bound mount is king of the mountains of the middle portion of the high as of the north and of the south sections moreover as far as i know it had never been i had the adjacent wilderness summer after summer but my studies thus far had never drawn me to the top of it its height above sea level is about feet and it is round by inclined and of tremendous depth and which render it almost inaccessible but difficulties of this kind only the next morning the artists went heartily to their work and i to mine former experiences had given good reason to know that passionate storms invisible as yet might be brooding in the calm therefore before bidding farewell i warned the artists not to be alarmed should i fail to appear before a week or ten days and advised them in case a snow storm should set in to keep up big fires and shelter themselves as best they could and the mountains of on no account to become frightened and attempt to seek their way back to alone through the my general plan was simply this to scale the wall cross over to the eastern flank of the range and then make my way southward to the northern spurs of mount in compliance with the intervening for to push on directly southward from camp through the innumerable peaks 
53,and that adorn this portion of the of the range however interesting would take too much time besides being extremely difficult and dangerous at this time of year all my first day was pure pleasure simply indulgence crossing the dry of the ancient tracing happy streams and learning the habits of the birds and in the groves and rocks before i had gone a mile from camp i came to the foot of a white that beats its way down a rugged in the wall from a height of about nine hundred feet and its throbbing waters into the i was acquainted with its fountains which fortunately lay in my course what a fine companion it proved to be what songs it sang and how passionately it told the mountain s own joy gladly i climbed along its dashing border absorbing its divine music and bathing from time to time in of spray higher higher new beauty came streaming on the sight painted meadows late blooming gardens peaks of rare architecture lakes here and there shining like silver and glimpses of the a near view of the high middle region and the yellow far in the west beyond the range i saw the so called desert lying silent in thick light â a desert of heavy sun glare beheld from a desert of ice granite here the waters divide shouting in glorious enthusiasm and falling eastward to vanish in the sands and dry sky of the great basin or westward to the great valley of and thence through the bay of san and the golden gate to the sea passing a little way down over the summit until i had reached an elevation of about feet i pushed on southward toward a group of savage peaks that stand guard about on the north and west groping my way and dealing instinctively every obstacle as it presented itself here a huge would be found cutting across my path along the dizzy edge of which i scrambled until some less point was discovered where i might safely venture to the bottom and then selecting some portion of the opposite wall with the same slow caution massive flat spurs alternate with the plunging abruptly from the shoulders of the snowy peaks and planting their feet in the desert these were everywhere marked and adorned with characteristic of the ancient that swept over this entire region like one vast ice wind and the polished produced by the ponderous flood are still so perfectly preserved that in many places the sunlight reflected from them is about as trying to the eyes as sheets of snow god s mills grind slowly but they have the mountains of been kept in motion long enough in to grind soil for a glorious abundance of life though most of the has been earned to the leaving these high regions comparatively lean and bare while the post agents of have not yet furnished sufficient available food over the general surface for more than a few of the plants chiefly and and it is interesting to learn in this connection that the and repressed character of the vegetation at this height is caused more by want of soil than by of climate for here and there in sheltered hollows beneath the general sm f ace into which a few rods of have been we find groves of and pine thirty to forty feet high trimmed around the edges with willow and bushes and still further by an outer ring of tall bright with and suggesting a climate by no means severe all the streams too and the pools at this elevation are furnished with uttle gardens wherever soil can be made to lie which though making scarce any show at a distance constitute charming surprises to the observer in these bits of a few birds find grateful homes having no acquaintance with man they fear no ill and flock curiously about the stranger almost allowing themselves to be taken in the hand in so wild and so beautiful a region was spent my first day every sight and sound inspiring leading one far out of himself yet feeding and building up his individuality a near view of the high now came the solemn silent evening long blue shadows crept out across the snow while a rosy glow at first scarce gi deepened and eveiy mountain top flushing the and the harsh above them this was the to me one of the most impressive of all the of god at the touch of this divine light the mountains seemed to to a religious consciousness and stood hushed and waiting like devout just before the began to fade two crimson clouds came streaming across the summit like wings of flame rendering the sublime scene yet more impressive then came darkness and the stars icy was still miles away but i could proceed no farther that night i found a good on the rim of a basin about feet above the sea a small lake in the bottom of it from which i got water for my tea and a thicket near by furnished abundance of fire wood peaks and shattered half way around the horizon wearing a savage aspect in the and a solemnly across the lake on its way down from the foot of a the fall and the lake and the were almost equally bare while the pines in the were so and by storm winds that you might walk over their tops in tone and aspect the scene was one of the most desolate i ever beheld but the darkest of the mountains are with bright passages of love the mountains of that never fail to make themselves felt when one is alone i made my bed in a nook of the pine thicket where the branches were pressed and overhead like a roof and bent down around the sides these are the best the high mountains d â snug 
53,as nests well fuu of and with plenty of wind played needles to sing one asleep i little expected company but creeping in through a low side door i found five or six birds among the the night wind began to blow soon after dark at first only a gentle breathing but increasing toward midnight to a rough gale that fell upon my leafy roof in ragged like a bearing wild sounds from the ci overhead the sang in chorus filling the old ice fountain with its roar and seeming to increase in power as the night advanced â fit voice for such a landscape i had to creep out many times to the fire during the night for it was biting cold and i had no blankets gladly i welcomed the morning star the dawn in the dry wavering air of the desert was glorious everything encouraged my undertaking and success there was no cloud in the sky no tone in the wind breakfast of bread and tea was soon made i fastened a hard crust to my belt by way of provision in case i should be compelled to pass a night on the mountain top then securing the remainder of my little stock against wolves and wood rats i set forth free and hopeful how glorious a greeting the sun gives the a view of the high to behold this alone is worth the pains of any excursion a thousand times over the highest peaks burned like islands in a sea of liquid shade then the lower peaks and caught the glow and long of light streaming through many a and pass fell thick on the frozen meadows the majestic form of was full in sight and i pushed rapidly on over rounded rock and my iron shod shoes making a sound suddenly hushed now and then in of and lake soft as moss here too in this so called land of desolation i met growing in among the battered rocks her blossoms had faded long ago but they were still clinging with happy memories to the and still so beautiful as to thrill every of one s being winter and summer you may hear her voice the low sweet melody of her purple bells no among all the mountain plants speaks nature s love more plainly than where she dwells the of the solitude is complete the very rocks and seem to feel her presence and become with her own fountain sweetness all things were warming and awakening frozen began to flow the came out of their nests in piles and climbed sunny rocks to and the headed were flitting about seeking their the lakes seen from every ridge top were brilliantly and like the of the low dwarf pines the rocks too seemed to the vital heat â rock and snow thrill the mountains of ing alike i strode on as if never more to feel fatigue limbs moving of themselves every sense like the flowers to take part in the new day harmony all along my course thus far excepting when down in the the were mostly open to me and at least on one side on the left were the purple plains of and warm on the right the near peaks springing keenly into the thin sky with more and more impressive but these larger views were at length lost rugged spurs and and huge projecting began to shut me in every feature became more rigidly however producing any effect for going to the mountains is like going home we always find that the strangest objects in these fountain are in some degree familiar and we look upon them with a vague sense of having seen them before on the southern shore of a frozen lake i encountered an extensive field of hard snow up which i in fine tone intending to follow it to its head and cross the rocky spur against which it hoping thus to come direct upon the base of the main peak the surface was with oval hollows made by stones and drifted pine needles that had melted themselves into the mass by the of absorbed sun heat these afforded good but the surface curved more and more at the head and the became and less abundant until i found myself in danger of being a view of the high shed off like snow i persisted however creeping on all and shuffling up the places on my back as i had often done on granite until after slipping several times i was compelled to my course to the bottom and make my way around the west end of the lake and thence up to the summit of the divide between the head waters of creek and the of the san arriving on the summit of this dividing crest one of the most exciting pieces of e wilderness was disclosed that i ever discovered in all my there immediately in front loomed the majestic mass of mount with a down its face nearly to my feet then westward and pouring its frozen flood into a dark blue lake whose shores were bound with of snow while a deep chasm drawn between the divide and the separated the massive e from everything else i could see only the one sublime mountain the one the one lake the whole veiled with one blue shadow â rock ice and water close together without a single leaf or sign of life after gazing i began instinctively to every and and of the mountain with reference to making the ascent the entire front above the appeared as one tremendous precipice slightly receding at the top and with and set above one another in formidable an ay massive stood forward here and there the mountains op at the top with and separated by frosty and recesses that have been veiled in shadow ever since their creation while to right and left as far as i 
53,could see were huge crumbling offering no hope to the the head of the sends up a few finger like branches through narrow but these seemed too steep and short to be available especially as i had no ax with which to cut steps and the numerous narrow down which stones and snow are seemed hopelessly steep besides being interrupted by while the whole front was rendered still more terribly forbidding by the shadow and the gloomy blackness of the rocks descending the divide in a hesitating mood i picked my way across the yawning chasm at the foot and out upon the there were no meadows now to cheer with their brave colors nor could i hear the headed whose cheery notes so often the silence of our highest mountains the only sounds were the of small down in the veins and of the and now and then the rattling report of falling stones with the echoes they shot out into the crisp air i could not distinctly hope to reach the summit from this side yet i moved on across the as if driven by fate with myself the season is too far spent i said and even should i be successful i might be storm bound on the mountain and in the cloud darkness with the cliffs and covered with snow how could i escape f a view of the high q no i must wait till next i would only approach the mountain now and inspect it creep about its learn what i could of its history holding myself ready to flee on the approach of the first storm cloud but we little know until tried how much of the there is in us urging across and torrents and up dangerous heights let the judgment forbid as it may i succeeded in gaining the foot of the cliff on the eastern extremity of the and there discovered the mouth of a through which i began to climb intending to follow it as far as possible and at least obtain some fine wild views for my pains its general course is to the plane of the mountain face and the of which the mountain is built are cut by in such a way that they weather off in blocks giving rise to steps that gi climbing on the sheer places i thus made my way into a wilderness of crumbling and built together in bewildering and glazed in many places with a thin of ice which i had to hammer off with stones the situation was becoming gradually more perilous but having passed several dangerous spots i dared not think of descending for so steep was the entire ascent one would inevitably fall to the in case a single were made knowing therefore the tried danger beneath i became all the more anxious concerning the to be made above and began to be conscious of a vague of what actually not that i was given to fear q the mountains of but rather because my instincts usually so positive and true seemed in some way and were leading me astray at length after an elevation of about feet i found myself at the foot of a sheer drop in the bed of the channel i was tracing which seemed absolutely to bar further progress it was only about forty five or fifty feet high and somewhat by and but these seemed so slight and as that i tried hard to avoid the precipice altogether by the wall of the channel on either side but though less steep the walls were than the rock and repeated efforts only showed that i must either go right ahead or turn back the tried dangers beneath seemed even greater than that of the cliff in front therefore after its face again and again i began to scale it picking my holds with intense caution after gaining a point about to the top i was suddenly brought to a dead stop with clinging close to the face of the rock unable to move hand or foot either up or down my doom appeared fixed i must fall there would be a moment of bewilderment and then a lifeless down the one general precipice to the below when this final danger flashed upon me i became nerve shaken for the first time since setting foot on the mountains and my mind seemed to fill with a stifling smoke but this terrible lasted only a moment when life forth again with clearness i seemed suddenly to become possessed of a new sense the other self a view of the high experiences instinct or guardian angel â call it what you will â came forward and assumed control then my trembling muscles became m again eveiy and flaw in the rock was seen as through a and my limbs moved with a and precision with which i seemed to have nothing at all to do had i been aloft upon wings my could not have been more complete above this memorable spot the face of the mountain is still more savagely and torn it is a of yawning and in the angles of which rise and piles of detached that seem to have been gotten ready to be launched below but the strange of strength i had received seemed inexhaustible i found a way without effort and soon stood upon the in the blessed light how truly glorious the landscape around this noble summit â giant mountains valleys innumerable and meadows rivers and lakes with the wide blue sky bent tenderly over them all but in my first hour of freedom from that terrible shadow the sunlight in which i was seemed all in all looking southward along the of the range the eye is first caught by a row of exceedingly sharp and slender which rise openly to a height of about a thousand feet above a series of short that lean back against 
54,their their fantastic and the with which they spring out of the ice rendering them peculiarly wild and striking these the mountains of are the beyond them you behold a sublime wilderness of mountains their snowy towering together in crowded abundance peak beyond peak swelling higher higher as they sweep on southward until the point of the range is reached on mount near the head of the at an elevation of nearly feet above the level of the sea westward the general flank of the range is seen flowing away from the p in smooth a sea of huge gray granite waves dotted with lakes and meadows and with that grow steadily deeper as they in the distance below this gray region lies the dark forest broken here and there by and and yet beyond lies a yellow belt marking the broad plain of the san bounded on its farther side by the blue mountains of the coast turning now to the northward there in the immediate is the glorious crown with cathedral peak a temple of architecture a few degrees to the left of it the gi ay massive form of mountain to the right while tower peak castle peak silver mountain and a host of noble companions as yet nameless make a sublime show along the of the range eastward the whole region seems a land of desolation covered with beautiful light the basin of with its one bare lake fourteen miles long s valley and the broad table land at its head dotted with and the mountains op the massive range even the in height these are spread map like beneath you with countless beyond passing and one another and fading on the glowing horizon at a distance of less than feet below the summit of mount you may find of the san and s rivers sting forth from the ice and snow of the that load its while a little to the north of here are found the highest of the and thus the fountains of four of the principal rivers of are within a of four or five miles lakes are seen gleaming in all sorts of places â round or oval or square like very others narrow and drawn close around the peaks like silver the highest reflecting only rocks snow and the sky but neither these nor the nor the bits of brown meadow and that occur here and there are large enough to make any marked impression upon the mighty wilderness of mountains the eye rejoicing in its freedom about the vast expanse yet returns again and again to the fountain peaks perhaps some one of the multitude special attention some gigantic castle with and or some cathedral more abundantly than s but generally when looking for the first time from an all embracing like this the inexperienced observer is oppressed by the incomprehensible grandeur variety and abundance of the mountains rising shoulder to shoulder a view of the high beyond the reach of vision and it is only after they have been studied one by one long and lovingly that their far reaching become manifest then penetrate the wilderness where you may the main telling es to which all the is subordinate are quickly perceived and the most complicated clusters of peaks stand revealed and fashioned like works of art â eloquent monuments of the ancient ice rivers that brought them into relief from the general mass of the range the too some of them a mile deep wildly through the mighty host of mountains however lawless and at first sight they appear are at length recognized as the necessary effects of causes which followed each other in harmonious â nature s poems carved on tables of stone â the simplest and most emphatic of her could we have been here to observe during the period we should have overlooked a wrinkled ocean of ice as continuous as that now covering the of filling every valley and with only the tops of the fountain peaks rising darkly above the rock ice waves like in a stormy sea â those the only hints of the glorious now smiling in the sun standing here in the deep brooding silence all the wilderness seems motionless as if the work of creation were done but in the midst of this outer we know there is incessant motion and change ever and anon are falling from yonder peaks these cliff bound the mountains of seemingly and immovable are flowing like water and grinding the rocks beneath them the lakes are their granite shores and wearing them away and every one of these and young rivers is the air into music and the mountains to the plains here are the roots of all the life of the valleys and here more simply than elsewhere is the eternal of nature manifested ice changing to water lakes to meadows and mountains to plains and while we thus contemplate nature s methods of landscape creation and reading the records she has carved on the rocks however imperfectly the of the past we also learn that as these we now behold have succeeded those of the age so they in tm n are withering and vanishing to be succeeded by others yet but in the midst of these fine lessons and i had to remember that the sun was far to the west while a new way down the mountain had to be discovered to some point on the timber line where i could have a fire for i had not even myself with a coat i first the western spurs hoping some way might appear through which i might reach the northern and cross its or pass around the lake into which it flows and thus strike my morning track this route was soon sufficiently unfolded to show that if practicable at all it would require so much time that reaching camp that night would be out of the question 
54,i therefore scrambled back eastward descending the southern slopes at the same time here the seemed less f a near view op the high able and the head of a that flows came in sight which i determined to follow as far as possible hoping thus to make my way to the foot of the peak on the east side and thence across the intervening and to camp the inclination of the is quite moderate at the head and as the sun had softened the i made safe and rapid progress running and sliding and keeping up a sharp outlook for about half a mile from the head there is an where the over a sharp and is shattered into massive blocks separated by deep blue to thread my way through the slippery of this portion seemed impossible and i endeavored to avoid it by climbing off to the shoulder of the mountain but the slopes rapidly and at length fell away in sheer compelling a n to the ice fortunately the day had been warm enough to the ice so as to admit of hollows being dug in the rotten portions of the blocks thus me to pick my way with far less difficulty than i had anticipated continuing down over the and along the left was only a confident showing that the ascent of the mountain by way of this is easy provided one is armed with an ax to cut steps here and there the lower end of the was beautifully waved and barred by the edges of the ice which represent the annual and to some extent the of structure caused by the of the walls of and by separate which have been the mountains op followed by rain hail and etc small were gliding and over the melting surface with a smooth appearance in channels of pure ice â their quick movements most with the rigid invisible flow of the itself on whose back they all were riding night drew near before i reached the eastern base of the mountain and my camp lay many a rugged mile to the north but ultimate success was assured it was now only a matter of endurance and ordinary mountain craft the sunset was if possible yet more beautiful than that of the day before the landscape seemed to be fairly with purple light the peaks along the summit were in shadow but through every and pass streamed vivid soothing and their rough black angles while companies of small luminous clouds hovered above them like very angels of light darkness came on but i found my way by the of the and the peaks projected against the sky all excitement died with the light and then i was but the joyful sound of the across the lake was heard at last and soon the stars were seen reflected in the lake itself taking my bearings from these i discovered the little pine thicket in which my nest was and then i had a rest such as only a tired may enjoy after lying loose and lost for awhile i made a sunrise fire went down to the lake dashed water on my head and dipped a for tea the revival brought about by bread and tea was as complete as the exhaustion a near view of the high from excessive enjoyment and toil then i crept beneath the pine to bed the wind was frosty and the fire burned low but my sleep was none the less sound and the evening had swept far to the west before i awoke after and resting in the morning sunshine i sauntered home â that is back to the camp â bearing away toward a cluster of peaks that hold the fountain of one of the north of rush creek here i discovered a gi of beautiful lakes together in a grand toward evening i crossed the divide separating the waters from those of the and entered the basin that now holds the fountain of the stream that forms the upper this stream i traced down through its many and meadows and reaching the brink of the main at dusk a loud for the artists was answered again and again their camp fire came in sight and half an hour afterward i was with them they seemed glad to see me i had been absent only three days nevertheless though the weather was fine they had already been weighing chances as to whether i would ever return and trying to decide whether they should wait longer or begin to seek their way back to the now their curious troubles were over they packed their precious sketches and next morning we set out homeward bound and in two days entered the valley from the north by way of indian chapter v the passes sustained grandeur of the high a is i strikingly illustrated by the great height of the passes between latitude â and the lowest pass gap or of any kind cutting across the of the range as far as i have discovered feet in height above the level of the sea while the average height of all that are in use either by indians or is perhaps not less than feet and not one of these is a carriage pass farther north a carriage road has been constructed through what is known as the pass on the head waters of the and s rivers the summit of which is about feet above the sea substantial wagon roads have also been built through the and johnson passes near the head of lake over which immense quantities of freight were hauled from to the regions of before the construction of the central pacific railroad still farther north a considerable number of comparatively low passes occur some of which are accessible to wheeled and through these rugged during the exciting years of the gold the passes period long trains with foot sore cattle 
54,wearily toiled after the toil worn had escaped a thousand dangers and had crawled thousands of miles across the plains the snowy at last loomed in sight the eastern wall of the land of gold and as with shaded eyes they gazed through the tremulous haze of the desert with what joy must they have the pass through which they were to enter the better land of their hopes and dreams between the pass and the southern extremity of the high a distance of nearly miles there are only five passes through which conduct from one side of the range to the other these are barely practicable for animals a pass in these regions meaning simply any or through which one may by the exercise of unlimited patience make out to lead a mule or a sure footed animals that can slide or jump as well as walk only three of the five passes may be said to be in use the and virginia creek the tracks leading through the others being only obscure indian not in the least and scarcely by white men for much of the way is over solid rock and earthquake where the of the indians leave no sign only skilled are able to detect the marks that serve to guide the indians such as slight of the rocks the of stones here and there and bent bushes and weeds a general knowledge of the is then the main guide one to determine where the mountains of the trail ought to go â go one of these indian crosses the range by a nameless pass between the head waters of the south and middle forks of the san the other between the north and middle forks of the same river just to the south of the this last being about feet high is the lowest of the five the is the highest crossing the summit near the head of the south fork of king s river about eight miles to the north of mount through the midst of the most rock the summit of this pass is over feet above nevertheless it is one of the safest of the five and is used every summer from july to october or november by s and and to some extent by also for besides the surpassing grandeur of the scenery about the summit the trail in ascending the western flank of the range through a grove of the giant and through the magnificent valley of the south fork of king s river this is perhaps the highest pass on the north american continent the pass lies to the east of valley at the head of one of the of the south fork of the this is the best known and most of all that exist in the high a trail was made through it about the time of the gold excitement in the year by adventurous and â men who would build a trail down the throat of darkest on the way to gold though more than a thousand feet lower than the s i f t j p ot â y â c l i i ax c im j l j s â b m fc w f map of â â g i â r t d n a the mountains of it is scarcely less sublime in rock scenery while in snowy falling water it far it being so situated for the stream of travel the more adventurous cross over through this glorious to the region around lake it has therefore gained a name and fame above every other pass in the range according to the few observations made upon it its highest point is feet above the sea the other pass of the five we have been considering is somewhat lower and crosses the of the range a few miles to the north of the pass at the head of the of s river it is used chiefly by bands of the indians and but leaving wheels and animals out of the question the free with a sack of bread on his shoulders and an ax to cut steps in ice and frozen snow can make his way across the range almost everywhere and at any time of year when the weather is calm to him nearly every between the peaks is a pass though much patient step cutting is at times required up and down inclined with cautious climbing over that at first sight would seem hopelessly inaccessible in pursuing my studies i have crossed from side to side of the range at intervals of a few miles all along the highest portion of the chain with far less real danger than one would naturally on and what fine was thus revealed â storms and lakes and the passes and meadows and interesting animals â only those will ever know who give the and most portion of their lives to climbing and seeing for themselves to the timid fresh from the of the these however picturesque and grand seem forbidding â cold dead gloomy in the bones of the mountains and of all nature s ways the ones to be most cautiously avoided yet they are full of the finest and most telling examples of nature s love and though hard to travel none are safer for they lead through regions that lie far above the ordinary haunts of the devil and of the that walks in darkness true there are innumerable places where the careless step will be the last step and a rock falling from the cliffs may crush without warning like lightning from the sky but what then accidents in the mountains are less common than in the and these mountain are decent delightful even divine f to die in compared with the chambers of civilization few places in this world are more dangerous than home fear not therefore to try the mountain passes they will kill care save 
54,you from deadly set you free and call forth every faculty into vigorous enthusiastic action even the sick should these so called dangerous passes because for every they kill they cm e a thousand all the passes make their on the eastern flank on this side the average rise is not far from a thousand feet to the mile while on the mountains of the west it is about two hundred feet another marked difference between the eastern and western portions of the passes is that the former begin at the very foot of the range while the latter can hardly be said to begin lower than an elevation of from seven to ten thousand feet approaching the range from the gray of and s valley on the east the sees before him the steep short passes in full view in by rugged spurs that come plunging down from the shoulders of the peaks on either side the courses of the more direct being disclosed from top to bottom without interruption but from the west one sees nothing of the way he may be seeking until near the summit after days have been spent in the forests growing on the main dividing between the river it is interesting to observe how sm the animals of every kind fall into the same the more rugged and inaccessible the general character of the of any particular region the more surely will the of white men indians bears wild sheep etc be found into the best passes the indians of the western slope e cautiously over the passes in settled weather to attend dances and obtain loads of pine nuts and the of a small fly that in and s lakes which when dried forms an important article of food while the cross over from the east to hunt the deer and obtain supplies of and it is truly astonishing to see what immense loads the haggard old make out to carry bare the passes footed through these rough passes for a distance of sixty or seventy miles they are always accompanied by the men who stride on and erect a little in advance kindly stooping at difficult places to pile stepping stones for their patient pack animal wives just as they would e the way for their bears great sagacity as but although they are and they seldom cross the range i have several times them through the pass but only in late years after cattle and sheep had passed that way when they doubtless were following to feed on the and on those that had been killed by falling over the rocks even the wild sheep the best of all choose regular passes in making journeys across the deer seldom cross the range in either direction i have never yet observed a single specimen of the mule deer of the great basin west of the summit and rarely one of the black species on the eastern slope notwithstanding many of the latter ascend the range nearly to the summit eveiy summer to feed in the wild gardens and bring forth their young the are the pass makers and it is by them that the courses of all are without exception every pass in the was created by them without the slightest aid or guidance from any of the agents i have seen elaborate statements of the amount of and accomplished in the construction of the railroad the mountains of across the above lake but for every pound of rock moved in this way the which descended east and west through this same pass crushed and carried away more than a hundred tons the so called practicable road passes are simply those portions of the range more degraded by action than the adjacent portions and degraded in such a way as to leave the rounded instead of sharp while the peaks from the superior strength and hardness of their rocks or from more favorable position having suffered less degradation are left towering above the passes as if they had been heaved into the sky by some force acting from beneath the scenery of all the passes especially at the head is of the wildest and description â lofty peaks together and laden around their with ice and snow chains of lakes streams in endless variety with glorious views westward over a sea of rocks and woods and eastward over strange plains and the dead looking of the great basin every pass however possesses treasures of beauty all its own having thus in a general way indicated the height leading features and distribution of the principal passes i will now endeavor to describe the pass in particular which may i think be regarded as a fair example of the higher passes in general the main portion of the pass is formed the passes by bloody which begins at the summit of the range and in a general east direction to the edge of the plain the first white men who forced a way through its depths were as we have seen eager gold but the was known and as a pass by the indians and mountain animals long before its discovery by white men as is shown by the numerous which come into it from every direction its name well with the character of the early times in and may perhaps have been suggested by the color of the in which it is in gi eat t or more probably by blood made by the unfortunate animals which were compelled to slip and awkwardly over its rough cutting rocks i have never known an animal either mule or horse to make its way through the either in going up or down without losing more or less blood from wounds on the legs occasionally one is killed outright â falling headlong and rolling over pre like a but such accidents are than from the terrible appearance of the trail one would be led to 
55,expect the more experienced when di loose find their way over the dangerous places with a caution and sagacity that is truly wonderful during the gold excitement it was at times a matter of considerable pecuniary importance to force a way through the with pack trains early in the spring while it was yet heavily blocked with snow and then the mountains of the with their loads had sometimes to be let down over the and beds by means of ropes a good bridle path leads from through many a grove and meadow up to the head of the a distance of about thirty miles here the scenery a sudden and startling mountains red gray and black rise close at hand on the right around their with banks of enduring snow on the left the huge red mass of mount while in front the eye down the shadowy and out on the warm plain of where the lake is seen gleaming like a with clusters of lofty to the south of it when at length we enter the mountain the rocks seem aware of our presence and seem to come closer about us happily the and the old familiar robin are here to sing us welcome and beam with and sympathy us to feel something of nature s love even here beneath the gaze of her rocks the effect of this expressive on the part of the rocks is greatly by the quiet aspect of the meadows through which we pass just before entering the narrow the forests in which they lie and the mountain tops rising beyond them seem quiet and tranquil we catch their spirit yield to the soothing influences of the sunshine and on thi flowers and bees scarce touched by a definite thought then suddenly we the passes find ourselves in the shadowy with nature in one of her wildest after the first bewildering impression begins to wear we perceive that it is not altogether terrible for besides the birds and flowers we discover a chain of shining hanging down from the very summit of the pass and together by a silvery stream the highest are set in bleak rough fringed with brown and yellow winter blow snow through the in blinding and shoot from the heights then are these sparkling filled and leaving not a hint of their existence in june and july they begin to and out like sleepy eyes the thrust up their short brown the bloom in turn and the most profoundly buried of them all is at length and as if winter were only a dream red lake is the lowest of the chain and also the largest it seems rather dull and forbidding at first sight lying motionless in its deep dark bed the wall rises sheer from the water s edge on the south but on the opposite side there is sufficient space and sunshine for a garden the of which is brilliantly lighted with lilies s and sheltered from the wind by leafy and forming a most joyful outburst of plant life keenly by the chill of the cliffs after indulging here in a lake rest the happy stream sets forth again the mountains of ling and like an ever delightfully confiding no matter how dark the way leaping gliding hither thither clear or foaming the beauty of its

into a diamond pattern by following the joints that the face of the precipice over which it viewed in front it a strip of of definite pattern varying through the seasons with the temperature and the volume of water scarce a flower may be seen along its snowy border a few bent pines look on from a distance and small of and are growing in the head but these are so lowly and that only the attentive observer will be likely to notice them on the north wall of the a little below the diamond a glittering side stream makes its appearance seeming to leap directly out of the sky it first a ribbon of silver hanging loosely down the wall but gi wider as it and the dull rock with foam a long rough cm up against this part of the cliff own with snow pressed in which the fall with many an eager and and

joined by the taller yellow and mountain pines these with the and rapidly gi ow larger as the sunshine becomes richer forming groves that block the view or they stand more apart here and there in groups that make beautiful and obvious harmony with the rocks and with one another blooming becomes abundant â and the rose weaving for the streams and shaggy to relieve the stern rock through this delightful wilderness creek without any channel throbbing and wavering now in sunshine now in thoughtful shade falling flashing from side to side in of energy a glorious way of is thus developed of

the glad creek gi own strong with tribute gathered from many a snowy fountain on the mountains of the heights sings richer strains and becomes more human and

branches and drooping kept in motion by the current fringe the brow of the in front from this leafy covert the stream leaps out into the light in a curve thick sown with sparkling and falls into a

beauty from the stream in passing over it â bright of notes of falls solemn of smooth gliding sheets all and in glorious harmony when at length its impetuous life is done it slips through a meadow with scarce an audible whisper and falls asleep in lake this water bed is one of the finest i ever saw wave soothingly about it and the breath of flowers over it like incense here our blessed stream rests from its rocky wanderings au its done â no more foaming rock leaping no more wild song it falls into a smooth sleep stirred only by the night wind which coming down the makes the passes it and

much higher level than now the principal characters in which the history of the ancient is ed are displayed here in freshness and simplicity furnishing the student with extraordinary advantages for the acquisition of knowledge of this sort the most striking passages are polished and which in many places reflect the rays of the sun like smooth water the dam of red lake is an of slate brought into relief because of its superior strength and because of the greater intensity of the of the rock immediately above it caused by a which entered the main trunk with a heavy down thrust at the head of

sides are groves the former devoted chiefly to and gi a square rod containing five or six of several species about the same number of and and a few gi ass each species being planted apart with bare gravel between as if cultivated my first visit to bloody was made in the summer of under circumstances well calculated to the impressions that are the peculiar of mountains i came from the blooming of and out into the plant gold of the great valley of when its was as yet never before had i beheld of social flowers half so extensive or half so glorious golden covered all the ground from the coast to the like a of sunshine in which i for weeks watching the rising and setting of their innumerable then i gave myself up to be borne forward on the crest of the summer wave that sweeps up the and itself on the snowy â the passes at the big meadows i remained more than a month and climbing among the mountains the with whom i then happened to be was one of those remarkable men one so frequently meets in the hard angles and of whose characters have been brought into relief by the grinding of the gold period until they resemble but at this late day my friend s had subsided and his craving for rest caused him to become a gentle shepherd and literally to lie down with the lamb the of my scotch instincts he threw out some hints concerning bloody and advised me to explore it i have never seen it myself he said for i never was so unfortunate as to pass that way but i have heard many a strange story about it and i warrant you will at least find it wild enough then of course i made haste to see it early next i made up a bundle of bread tied my note book to my belt and strode away in the air full of eager indefinite hope the that lay in my path to soothe my morning haste the sod in many places was with and blue over which i lingered i traced the paths of the ancient over many a shining pavement and marked the in the upper forests that told the power of the winter climbing higher i saw for the first time the gi of the pines in compliance with climate and on the summit discovered creeping of the willow overgrown with the mountains of and patches of the dwarf with its round flowers in the grass like hail while in every direction the landscape stretched away in fresh â a manuscript written by the hand of nature alone at length as i entered the pass the huge rocks began to close around in all their wild mysterious when suddenly as i was 
55,gazing eagerly about me a drove of gi ay beings came in sight toward me with a kind of motion like bears i never turn back though often so inclined and in this particular instance amid such sun seemed singularly for the calm acceptance of so a company my fears i soon discovered that although as hairy as bears and as crooked as summit pines the strange creatures were sufficiently erect to belong to our own species they proved to be nothing more than indians dressed in the skins of sage both the men and the women begged persistently for and tobacco and seemed so accustomed to that i found it impossible to convince them that i had none to give excepting the names of these two of civilization they seemed to understand not a word of english but i af ward learned that they were on their way to valley to feast awhile on and procure a load of to back through the pass to their huts on the shore of lake occasionally a good countenance may be seen among the indians but these the first the passes i had seen were mostly ugly and some of them altogether hideous the dirt on their faces was fairly and seemed so ancient and so undisturbed it might almost possess a significance the older faces were moreover strangely and divided into sections by that looked like the joints of rocks suggesting exposure on the mountains in a condition for ages somehow they seemed to have no right place in the landscape and i was glad to see them fading out of sight down the pass then came evening and the cliffs were inspired with the beauty of the a solemn calm fell upon all the lower portion of the was in shadow and i crept into a hollow near one of the upper to smooth the ground in a sheltered nook for a bed when the short twilight faded i kindled a sunny fire made a cup of tea and lay down to rest and look at the stars soon the night wind began to flow and pour in ton among the jagged peaks mingling strange tones with those of the sounding far below and as i drifted toward sleep i began to experience an uncomfortable feeling of to the then the full moon looked down over the edge of the wall her countenance seemingly filled with intense concern and apparently so near as to produce a startling effect as if she had entered my bedroom forgetting all the world to gaze on me alone the night was full of strange sounds and i gladly welcomed the morning breakfast was soon done and i set forth in the freshness the mountains of of the new day rejoicing in the abundance of pure so close about me the rocks and with centuries of storms stood sharply out in the thin early light while down in the bottom of the and polished heaved and like swelling sea waves telling a grand old story of the ancient that poured its crushing floods above them here for the first time i met the in all their perfection of purity and â gentle face to face with the stormy sky kept safe and warm by a thousand miracles i leaped lightly from rock to rock in the eternal freshness and of nature and in the tenderness with which she her mountain in the very fountains of storms fresh beauty appeared at every step rock and groups of the fairest flowers now another lake came to view now a never fell light in brighter never fell water in foam i seemed to float through the enchanted feeling nothing of its and was out in the before i was aware looking back from the shore of lake my morning seemed all a dream there curved bloody a mere feet deep with smooth rocks projecting from the sides and together in the middle like swelling muscles here the lilies were higher than my head and the sunshine was warm enough for palms yet the snow around the was plainly visible only four miles away and be the passes were narrow specimen of all the principal of the globe on the bank of a small brook that comes down the side of the left i found a camp e still burning which no doubt belonged to the gray indians i had met on the summit and i listened instinctively and moved cautiously foi ward half expecting to see some of their grim faces peering out of the bushes passing on toward the open plain i noticed three well defined curved gracefully across the stream and joined by long to the two noble these mark the of the vanished when it was retreating into its summit shadows on the breaking up of the winter five below the foot of lake just where the lose themselves in the plain there was a field of growing in magnificent waving six to eight feet high bearing heads from six to twelve inch es long rubbing out some of the i found them about five of an inch long dark colored and sweet indian women were gathering it in baskets bending down large beating it out and it in the wind they were quite picturesque coming through the as one caught glimpses of them here and there in winding lanes and with splendid above their heads while their incessant chat and laughter showed their heedless joy like the field i found the so called desert of blooming in a high state of natural the mountains of with the wild rose cherry and the delicate also innumerable and bush i observed then gestures and the various expressions of their inquiring how they could be so fresh and beautiful out in this desert they told as happy a life as any plant company i ever met and seemed to enjoy even the hot sand and the wind 
55,but the vegetation of the pass has been in great part destroyed and the same may be said of all the more accessible passes throughout the range immense numbers of starving sheep and cattle have been driven through them into the wild gardens and meadows almost out of existence the lofty walls are untouched by any foot and the falls sing on unchanged but the sight of crushed flowers and stripped bitten bushes goes far toward destroying the charm of the should be seen in winter a good strong who knows the way and the weather might easily make a safe excursion through it from valley on snow shoes during some tranquil time when the storms are hushed the lakes and falls would be buried then but so also would be the traces of destructive feet while the views of the mountains in their winter garb and the ride at lightning speed down the pass between the snowy walls would be truly glorious chapter vi the lakes among the many for treasures that j are bound up and hidden away in the depths of a none more surely charm and surprise all kinds of than the lakes the forests and the and the snowy fountains of the streams their wealth in a more or less telling manner even in the distance but nothing is seen of the lakes until we have climbed above them all the upper branches of the rivers are fairly laden with lakes like orchard trees with fruit they lie in the deep woods down in the of high on bald and around the feet of the icy peaks back their wild beauty over and over again some conception of lavish abundance may be made from the fact that from one on the summit of red mountain a day s journey to the east of valley no fewer than forty two are displayed within a of ten miles the whole number in the can hardly be less than fifteen hundred not counting the smaller pools and which are innumerable perhaps two thirds or more lie on the western flank of the range and all are to the and the lakes regions at the close of the last period the middle and foot hill regions also in lakes all of which have long since vanished as completely as the magnificent ancient that brought them into existence though the eastern flank of the range is excessively steep we find lakes pretty regularly distributed throughout even the most portions they are mostly found in the upper branches of the and in the around the peaks occasionally long narrow specimens occur upon the steep sides of dividing their swung like and very rarely one is found lying so exactly on the of the range at the head of some pass that its waters are discharged down both when the snow is melting fast but however situated they soon cease to form surprises to the for like all the love work of nature they are related to one another and to all the other features of the mountains it is easy therefore to find the bright lake eyes in the and most looking of any landscape countenance even in the lower regions where they have been closed for many a century their rocky are still filled in with the of flood and a beautiful system of in correspondence with the is soon perceived also their extension in the direction of the of the ancient and in general their dependence as to form size and position t on the character of the rocks in which the mountains of their have been and the quantity and direction of application of the force expended upon each basin in the upper we usually find them in pretty regular succession strung together like beads on the bright of their which pour white and gray with foam and spray from one to the other their perfect mirror stillness making impressive with the gi and and glare of the connecting in lake hollow on the north side of the spur immediately above the great there are ten lovely lying near together in one general hollow like eggs in a nest seen from above in a general view with and fringed with they seem to me the most singularly beautiful and lake cluster i have ever yet discovered lake miles long by about wide and from to over feet in depth is the largest of all the lakes it lies just beyond the northern limit of the higher portion of the range between the main and a spur that puts out on the east side from near the head of the river its shores go cm in and out around many an bay and pine crowned and its waters are everywhere as keenly pure as any to be found among the highest mountains lake rendered memorable by the terrible fate of the party is about three miles long and lies about ten miles to the north of at the head of one of the of the a few miles farther north lies lake independence the lakes about the same size as but far the greater number of the lakes lie much higher and are quite small few of them exceeding a mile in length most of them less than half a mile along the lower edge of the lake belt the smallest have disappeared by the in of their leaving only those of considerable size but all along the upper margin of the lake bearing eveiy hollow however small lying within reach of any portion of the close of streams contains a bright pool so that the landscape viewed from the seems to be sown with them many of the larger lakes are encircled with smaller ones like central gems with sparkling in general however there is no marked dividing line as to size in order therefore to prevent confusion i would state here that in giving numbers i include 
56,none less than yards in in the basin of the river i counted of which are upon the that fall so into valley creek which forms the fall of that name takes its rise in a beautiful lake lying beneath the shadow of a lofty granite spur that puts out from vista peak this is now the only lake left in the whole basin the has sixteen the no fewer than sixty seven the eight creek five and creek fourteen there are but two other lake bearing of the the south fork with fifteen and creek with five both of which unite with the main trunk below the mountains of the river as a whole is remarkably like an elm tree and it requires but little effort on tbe part of the imagination to picture it standing upright with all its lakes hanging upon its spreading branches the eighty miles in height now add all the other lake bearing rivers of the each in its place and you will have a truly glorious an avenue the length and width of the lake op the range the long slender gi ay shafts of the main trunks the way of branches and the silvery lakes all clearly defined and on the sky how excitedly such an addition to the scenery would be gazed at yet these ul the lakes ers are still more beautiful and impressive in their natural positions to those who have the eyes to see them as they lie in their meadows and forests and rocks when a mountain lake is born â when like a young eye it first opens to the light â it is an irregular in banks of rock and ice â bare rock on the lower side the of a on the upper in this condition it remains for many a year until at length toward the end of some cluster of seasons the l the upper margin of the basin leaving it open from shore to shore for the first time thousands of years after its conception beneath the that its basin the landscape cold and bare is reflected in its pure depths the winds its surface and the sun fills it with throbbing while its waves v to lap and murmur around its shores â sun during the day and reflected stars at night its only flowers the winds and the snow its only visitors meanwhile the continues to and numerous still younger than the itself down sand gi and pebbles giving rise to and of soil to these fresh soil beds come many a waiting plant first a hardy with leaves and a of brown flowers then as the seasons gi ow warmer and the soil beds deeper and wider other take their appointed places and these are joined by blue and many a lowly moss shrubs also hasten in to the new the mountains of gardens â with its glossy leaves and purple flowers the willow making soft woven carpets together with the and the fairest and dearest of them all insects now the air pipe cheerily in the soon followed by the which is the first bird to visit a lake as the is the first of plants so the young lake grows in beauty becoming more and more from century to century groves of up and hardy pines and the until it is richly and but while its shores are being enriched the soil beds creep out with incessant gi its area while the lighter mud deposited on the bottom cause it to gi ow constantly until at length the last remnant of the lake â closed forever in ripe and natural old age and now its feeding stream goes winding on without halting through the new gardens and groves that have taken its place the length of the life of any lake depends ordinarily upon the capacity of its basin as compared with the carrying power of the streams that flow into it the character of the rocks over which these streams flow and the relative position of the lake toward other lakes in a series whose lie in the same and are fed by one and the same main stream the uppermost will of course vanish first unless some other lake filling agent comes in to the result because at first it receives nearly all of the that the stream brings the lakes down only the finest of the mud being carried through the highest of the series to the next below then the next higher and the next would be filled and the lowest would be the last to vanish but this simplicity as to duration is broken in upon in various ways chiefly through the action of side streams that enter the lower lakes direct for notwithstanding many of these side are quite short and during late summer feeble they all become powerful torrents in when the snow is melting and carry not only sand and pine needles but large trunks and tons in weight sweeping them down their inclined and into the lake with many of these side also have the advantage of access to the main of the vanished that occupied the and upon these they draw for lake filling material while the main trunk stream flows mostly ov t dean where but little matter is ever left for them to thus a small rapid stream with abundance of loose material its reach may fill up an extensive basin in a few centuries while a large trunk stream flowing over clean enduring though ordinarily a hundred times larger may not fill a smaller basin in thousands of the comparative e of gi eat and small streams as lake is strikingly illustrated in valley through which the flows the bottom of the valley is now composed of level meadow lands and dry soil beds planted the mountains op with oak and pine but it was once a lake stretching from wall to wall 
56,and nearly from one end of the valley to the other forming one of the most beautiful cliff bound sheets of water that ever existed in the and though never perhaps seen by human eye it was but yesterday speaking since it disappeared and the traces of its existence are still so fresh it may easily be restored to the eye of imagination and viewed in all its gi about as and vividly as if actually before us now we find that the which fills this magnificent basin was not brought down from the distant mountains by the main streams that here to form the river however powerful and available for the purpose at first sight they appear but almost wholly by the small local such as those of indian the and the three brothers and l y a few small which lingered in the shadows of the walls long after the main trunk had beyond the head of the valley had the that once covered the range been melted at once leaving the entire surface bare from top to bottom simultaneously then of course all the lakes would have come into existence at the same time and the highest other circumstances being equal would as we have seen be the first to vanish but because they melted gi from the foot of the range upward the lower lakes were the first to see the light and the first to be therefore instead of finding the lakes of the present day at the foot of the range we find them at the top most of the lower lakes van the lakes thousands of years before those now brightening the were and in general owing to the deliberation of the upward retreat of the the lowest of the existing lakes are also the oldest a gradual transition being apparent throughout the entire belt from the older meadow and forms all the mountains of the way up to those that are new bom lying bare and among the highest peaks a few small lakes unfortunately situated are extinguished suddenly by a single of an carrying down immense numbers of trees together with the soil they were growing upon others are by land earthquake etc but these lake deaths compared with those from the deliberate and incessant of may be termed accidental their fate is like that of trees struck by lightning the lake is of course still rising its present elevation being about feet above sea level somewhat higher than this toward the southern extremity of the range lower toward the northern on account of the difference in time of the of the due to difference in climate specimens here and there considerably below this limit in specially protected from or exceptional in size these however are not sufficiently numerous to make any marked in the line the highest i have yet found lies at an elevation of about feet in a at the foot of one of the highest of the summit peaks a few miles to the north of mount bitter the of perhaps twenty five or thirty are still in process of formation beneath the few lingering but by the time they are bom an equal or greater number will probably have died since the beginning of the close of the ice period the whole number in the range has perhaps never been greater than at present a rough to the average the lakes of these mountain lakes may be made from already suggested but i cannot stop here to present the subject in detail i must also forego in the mean time the pleasure of a full discussion of the interesting question of lake basin formation for which fine clear material in these mountains in addition to what has been already given on the subject i will only make this one statement every lake in the is a lake their were not merely and ed out by this mighty agent but in the first place were from the solid i must now make haste to give some nearer views of representative specimens lying at different on the main lake belt myself to descriptions of the features most characteristic of each w lake this is a fine specimen of the oldest and lowest of the existing lakes it lies about eight miles above valley on the main branch of the at an elevation of about feet above the sea and is everywhere so securely cliff bound that without artificial only wild animals can get down to its rocky shores from any direction its original length was about a mile and a half now it is only half a mile in length by about a fourth of a mile in width and over the lowest portion of the basin ninety eight feet deep its crystal waters are clasped around on the north and south by majestic granite walls in true style into the mountains of and which on the south come plunging down sheer into deep water from a height of from to feet the south this magnificent basin out of solid granite while forcing its way westward from the summit fountains toward and the exposed rocks around the shores and the projecting of the walls ground and beneath the vast ice flood still glow with silvery radiance notwithstanding the innumerable storms that have fallen upon them the general of the basin as well as the laid along the top of the walls and the gi and on the bottom and sides indicate in the most unmistakable manner the direction pursued by this mighty ice river its great depth and the tremendous energy it exerted in thi itself into and out of the basin bearing down with superior pressure upon this portion of its channel because of the greater consequently it deeper than the other portions about it and producing the lake bowl as the necessary result with these magnificent ice characters so vividly before us it is not easy 
56,to realize that the old that made them vanished of centuries ago for excepting the vegetation that has sprung up and the changes effected by an earthquake that hm led rock from the weaker the basin as a whole presents the same appearance that it did when first brought to light the lake itself however has undergone marked changes one sees at a glance that it is gi owing old more the lakes than two ds of its original area is now dry land covered with meadow and groves of pine and fir and the level bed of stretching across from wall to wall at the head is out all along its margin and will at length close the lake forever every lover of fine would delight to on a summer day through the groves now occupying the filled up portion of the basin the shore is traced by a ribbon of w sand upon which the play then comes a belt of broad interrupted here and by impenetrable of beyond this there are groves of trembling then a dark belt of two pine with here and there a round meadow nest like in its midst and lastly a narrow outer margin of majestic silver fir feet high the gi beneath the trees is covered with a luxuriant crop of chiefly and with purple and to one s shoulders while the open meadow patches glow throughout the summer with flowers â and and form favorite hiding and feeding grounds for bears and deer the rugged south wall is darkly along the top with an imposing array of silver while the all the way down to the water s edge are adorned with picturesque old their colored bark showing finely upon the gray of the gi these with a few dwarf pines and lean the mountains of out over ribs and or stand erect back in shadowy in an wild and fearless manner moreover the white and dwarf oak form graceful along the wherever the slightest hold can be effected rock too are here such as and making handsome on the and the delicate and hide back in by some and then the orange wall flower holds up its here and there in the sunshine and makes of gold but notwithstanding all this plant beauty the general impression in looking across the lake is of stern the and flowers are scarcely seen and not one of the whole surface is with plant life the north wall is more varied in but the general tone is the same a few flat and soil covered support of and pine and up of and live oak growing on rough earthquake their small streams come down between them their foaming brightened with gay and and close along the shore on this side there is a strip of rocky meadow with and white and the gi out on its border dip their leaves into the water the lower edge of the basin is a dam like swell of solid granite heavily by the old the lakes but scarce at all cut into as yet by the stream though it has flowed on since the lake came into existence as soon as the stream is fairly over the lake lip it breaks into never for a moment halting and scarce one of its glad energy until it reaches the next filled up basin a mile below then and through meadow and grove it breaks forth anew into gray and falls leaping and gliding in glorious of wild bound and dance down into another and yet another filled up lake basin then after a long rest in the of little it makes its display in the famous fall out of the clouds of spray at the foot of the fall the battered roaring river its way makes another mile of and rests a moment in pool then over the gi and cliff of the fall and goes thundering and down a choked of tremendous depth and into the tranquil reaches of the old lake basin tlie color beauty about shadow lake during the indian summer is much richer than one could hope to find in so young and so a wilderness almost every leaf is tinted then and the are in bloom but most of the color is given by the ripe gi and at the foot of the lake you stand in a trembling gi every leaf painted like a butterfly and away to right and left round the shores sweeps a ribbon of meadow red and brown dotted with pale yellow off here and there into the mountains of purple the walls too are dashed with bits of bright color that gleam out on the granite gray but neither the walls nor the margin meadow nor yet the gay fluttering grove in which you stand nor the lake itself flashing with can long hold your attention for at the head of the lake there is a gorgeous mass of orange yellow belonging to the main belt of the basin which seems the very fountain whence all the color below it had flowed and here your eye is filled and fixed this glorious mass is about thirty feet high and extends across the basin nearly from wall to wall rich of willow flame in front of it and from the base of these the brown meadow comes forward to the water s edge the whole being relieved against the green of the while thick sun gold is poured over all these blessed color days no cloud the sky the winds are gentle and the landscape rests hushed everywhere and impressive a few ducks are usually seen sailing on the lake apparently more for pleasure than anything else and the at the head of the sing always while gi and the are busy in the groves making delightful company and the feeling of gi without the deep hushed calm and peace this usually lasts the end of november 
56,then come days of quite another kind the winter clouds gi ow and bloom and shed their on every leaf and rock and all the colors vanish like a sunset the deer gather the lakes and hasten down their well known fearful of being snow bound storm storm snow on the and meadows and bending the slender pines to the ground in wide arches one over the other and like lodged wheat rush and boom from the heights immense heaps upon the frozen lake and all the summer glory is buried and lost yet in the midst of this hearty winter the sun shines warm at times calling the to in the snowy pines and seek out his hidden stores and the weather is never so severe as to drive away the and little nut and toward may the lake begins to open the hot sun sends down innumerable streams over the cliffs them round and with foam the snow slowly and the meadows show of gi then spring comes on flowers and flies the air and the sod and the deer come back to the upper groves like birds to an old nest i first discovered this charming lake in the autumn of while on my way to the at the head of the river it was rejoicing then in its colors hidden in the glorious like gold year after year i walked its without discovering any other trace of humanity than the remains of an indian camp fire and the bones of a deer that had been broken to get at the it lies out of the regular ways of indians who love to hunt in more accessible fields adjacent to their knowledge of deer haunts had probably them here some the mountains op hunger time when they wished to make sure of a feast for hunting in this lake hollow is like hunting in a park i had told the beauty of shadow lake only to a few friends fearing it might come to be trampled and improved like on my last visit as i was along the shore on the strip of sand between the water and sod reading the tracks of the wild animals that live here i was startled by a human track which i at once saw belonged to some shepherd for each step was turned out or â from the general course pursued and was also run over in an uncertain fashion at the heel while a row of round on the right indicated the staff that carry none but a shepherd could make such a track and after tracing it a few minutes i began to fear that he might be seeking for what else could he be seeking returning from the shortly afterward my worst fears were realized a trail had been made down the mountain side from the north and all the gardens and meadows were destroyed by a of as if swept by a fire the money were in the temple orange lake besides these larger lakes fed by the main streams there are many smaller ones lying aloft on the top of rock benches independent of the general channels and of course drawing their supplies from a very limited the lakes area notwithstanding they are mostly small and shallow owing to their from and the of powerful streams they often endure longer than others many times larger but less situated when very shallow they become dry toward the end of summer but because their are ground out of stone they no loss save from alone and the gi eat depth of snow that falls lasting into june makes their dry season short in any case orange lake is a fair illustration of this bench it lies in the middle of a beautiful pavement near the lower margin of the lake about a mile and a half to the of shadow lake it is only about yards in next the water there is a of with wide leaves then in regular order a shaggy of bushes a of with here and there a of the mountain ash then a of with a few pines around the outside these are of course and together form a wall l which the naked granite stretches away in every direction leaving it relieved uke a bunch of palms in a desert in autumn when the colors are ripe the whole circular gi at a little distance looks like a big handful of flowers set in a cup to be kept fresh â a of its feeding streams are exceedingly beautiful notwithstanding their and extreme they have no channel whatever and consequently are left free to spread in thin sheets upon the shining granite the of and wander at in many places the current is less than a fourth of an inch deep and flows with so little it is scarcely visible sometimes there is not a single foam bell or drifting or of any sort to manifest its motion yet when observed narrowly it is seen to form a web of gliding exquisitely woven giving beautiful reflections from its minute and and from the of large in being everywhere transparent in when the snow is melting the lake bowl is full and sends forth quite a large stream that slips for yards or so until it comes to an almost precipice feet high down which it in a fine then it its scattered waters and goes smoothly over folds of gently dipping granite to its with the main stream during the greater portion of the year however not a single water sound will you hear either at head or foot of the lake not even the whispered of ripple waves along the shore for the winds are out but the deep mountain silence is now and then by birds that stop here to rest and drink on their way across the lake king a beautiful variety of the bench top lakes occurs 
57,just where the gi eat of the main have been forward in rings by small the mountains of instead of being by a narrow ring of trees like orange lake these lie in dense woods so dense that in seeking them you may pass them by again and again although you may know nearly where they lie concealed lake king lying to the north of the of that name above the little valley is a fine specimen of this variety the pass it by and so do the ducks they could hardly get into it if they would without straight down inside the trees yet these isolated gems lying like fallen fruit detached from the branches are not altogether without inhabitants and joyous visitors of course fishes cannot get into them and this is generally true of nearly every lake in the range but they are all well with happy how did the get into them in the st place f perhaps their was carried in on the feet of ducks or other birds else their must have made some exciting excursions through the woods and up the sides of the down in the still pure depths of these hidden you may also find the of innumerable insects and a great variety of while the air above them is thick with humming wings through the midst of which fly are constantly darting and in autumn when the are ripe bands of and come to feast forming altogether delightful little for the pushing our way upward toward the of the range we find lakes in greater and gi abundance and more youthful in aspect at an the lakes tion of about feet above sea level they seem to have arrived at middle age â that is their seem to be about half filled with broad sheets of meadow are seen extending into them imperfect and in many places and more nearly level than those of the older lakes below them and the vegetation of their shores is of course more and fringe the meadow rocks while the luxuriant waving groves so characteristic of the lower lakes are represented only by of the dwarf pine and these however are very gi on rocky around the outer rim of the meadows or still more striking effect crown some rocky moreover from causes that we cannot stop here to explain the cliffs about these middle aged lakes are seldom of the massive type but are more broken and loss sheer and they usually stand back leaving the shores comparatively free while the few rocks that do come forward and plunge directly into deep water are seldom more than three or four hundred feet high i have never yet met ducks in any of the lakes of this kind but the is never wanting where the feeding streams are wild sheep and deer may occasionally be seen on the meadows and very rarely a bear one might camp on the rugged shores of these bright fountains for weeks without meeting any animal larger than the that beneath along the edges of the meadows the highest and youngest of all the lakes lie the mountains op in at first sight they seem pictures of pure desolation miniature seas bound in perpetual ice and snow and by harsh gloomy crumbling their waters are keen blue in the deepest parts lively grass gi een toward the shore and around the edges of the small usually floating about in them a few hardy frost pinched every night are occasionally found making soft along the sun touched portions of their shores and when their northern banks slope openly to the south and are soil covered no matter how they are sure to be brightened with flowers one lake in particular now comes to mind which the of the banks of these icy gems close up under the shadow of the on the eastern slope of the range lies one of the of these lakes at an elevation of about feet a short ragged edged into it from the south and on the opposite side it is and by a series of made by the when it entirely filled the basin half a mile below lies a second lake at a height of feet about as cold and as pure as a snow crystal the waters of the first come down into it over and through the dam while a second stream into it direct from a that lies to the sheer of snow rise out of deep water on the south keeping perpetual winter on that side but there is a fine spot on the other notwithstanding the lake is only about yards the lakes wide here on august found a company of flowers not pinched crouching scarce able to look up but warm and standing erect in rich cheery color and bloom on a narrow strip of close to the s edge there were a few of gone to seed and a little way back up the rocky bank at the foot of a wall so inclined as to and as well as reflect a considerable quantity of sun heat was the garden containing a thicket of covered with large yellow flowers several bushes of the with nearly ripe and wildly a few handsome belonging to two distinct species and one a few hairy and radiant whose blue and rose colored flowers were set off to fine advantage amid gi een and along a narrow in the very warmest angle of the wall a perfectly gorgeous fringe of with flowers ah inch wide crowded together in lavish profusion and colored as royal a purple as ever was worn by any high bred plant of the and best of all and greatest of all a noble in full bloom standing erect head and shoulders above his companions and thrusting out his in sturdy vigor as if growing on a all this brave warm bloom among the raw stones right in 
57,the face of the as far as i have been able to find out these upper lakes are snow buried in winter to a depth of about thirty five or forty feet and those most exposed to to a depth of even a hundred feet or more these last are of course nearly lost to the the mountains of landscape some remain buried for years when the is great and many open only on one side in the season the snow of the closed side is composed of coarse and frozen into a faintly mass like the of a the waves of the open portion gradually and cause it to break off in large masses like which gives to a front like the wall of a entering the sea the play of the lights among the crystal angles of these snow cliffs the white of the the drifting in front in the sun and edged with green water and the deep blue of the lake itself extending to your feet â this forms a picture that all and is never forgotten but however perfect the season and the day the cold of these yoimg lakes is always keenly felt we approach them with a kind of mean caution and steal around their crystal shores dashed and ill at ease as if expecting to hear some forbidding voice but the of the and the love looks of the gradually us and manifest the warm fountain humanity that the and most solitary of them all chapter vn the meadows after the lakes on the high come the xx meadows they are smooth level lying in the upper forests on the floors of the valleys and along the broad backs of the main dividing at a height of about to feet above the sea they are nearly as level as the lakes whose places they have taken and present a even surface free from rock heaps and the of rank coarse and vegetation the sod is close and fine and so complete that you cannot see the gi and at the same time so brightly with flowers and that it may well be called a or meadow garden for the sod is in many places so crowded with and various species of that the grass is scarcely noticeable while in others the flowers are only pricked in here and there singly or in small ornamental the most influential of the the sod is a delicate with fine leaves and loose that seem to float above the lawn like a mist but the mountains of write as i may i cannot give anything like an adequate idea of the exquisite beauty of these mountain carpets as they lie smoothly in the savage wilderness what words are fine enough to picture them f to what shall we them f the of the of the old west the luxuriant of the south and the finest of cultivated meadows are coarse in comparison one may at first sight compare them with the carefully tended of pleasure grounds for they are as free from weeds as they and as smooth but here the likeness ends for these wild with all their exquisite have no trace of that painful licked repressed appearance that pleasure ground are apt to have even when viewed at a distance and not to mention the flowers with which they are brightened their are very much finer both in color and texture and instead of lying flat and motionless together like a dead green cloth they respond to the touches of every breeze rejoicing in pure blooming and in the vital light meadows abound throughout all the and regions of the in still numbers than the lakes probably from to exist between latitude and â distributed of course like the lakes in with all the other features of the landscape on the head waters of the rivers there are what are called big meadows usually about from five to ten miles long these occupy the of the ancient ice seas where many came together to form the grand trunks most however the meadows are quite small perhaps but little more than three of a mile in length one of the very finest of the thousands i have enjoyed lies hidden in an extensive forest of the pine on the edge of the basin of the ancient de about eight miles to the west of mount imagine yourself at the springs on the bank of the river a day s journey above valley you set off northward through a forest that stretches away before you seemingly unbroken by of any kind as soon as you are fairly into the woods the gray mountain peaks with their snowy and hollows are lost to view the ground is with fallen trunks that lie crossed and like storm lodged wheat and besides this close forest of pines the rich soil a luxuriant growth of ribbon â etc which rear their handsome and above your waist making your way through the fertile wilderness â finding lively bits of interest now and then in the and and perchance in a deer or bear â after the lapse of an hour or two bars of sunshine are seen ahead between the brown shafts of the pines showing that you are approaching an open space and then you suddenly from the forest shadows upon a delightful purple lawn lying smooth and free in the light like a lake this is a meadow it is about a mile and a half long by a quarter of a mile the trees come pressing forward all around in close ranks the mountains of planting their feet exactly on its mai gin and holding themselves erect strict and orderly like soldiers on parade thus bounding the meadow with exquisite precision yet with free cm lines such as nature alone can draw with delight you out into the grassy sun lake feeling yourself contained in one of nature 
57,s most chambers withdrawn from the influences of the mountains e from all intrusion e from yourself free in the universal beauty and notwithstanding the scene is so spiritual and you seem dissolved in it yet about you is beating with warm human love and life delightfully substantial and familiar the pines are types of health and the feeding on the sod belong to the same species you have known since childhood and surely these and are the very friend flowers of the old home garden bees hum as in a hai noon flies above the flowers and like them you lave in the vital sunshine too richly and joy filled to be capable of partial thought you are all eye through and through with light and beauty along the brook that silently through the meadow from the east special flowers call you back to

see with vision the fountains among the summit peaks to the east whence flowed the that ground soil for the forest and down at the foot of the meadow the which formed the dam which gave rise to the lake that occupied this basin before the meadow was made the meadows and around the margin the stones that were back and piled up into a rude wall by the of the lake ice during long and along the sides of the streams the slight hollows of the meadow which mark those portions of the old lake that were the last to vanish i would fain ask my readers to linger awhile in this fertile wilderness to trace its history from its earliest and learn what we may of its wild inhabitants and s how happy the birds are all summer and some of them all winter how the drive under the snow and how fine and brave a life the lives here and the deer and bears i but knowing well the difference between reading and seeing i will only ask attention to some brief sketches of its varying aspects as they are presented throughout the more marked seasons of the year the summer life we have been lasts with but little until october when the night begin to sting the gi and the leaves of the creeping along the banks of the stream to purple and crimson while the flowers disappear all save the and a few that continue to bloom on until the beginning of snowy winter in still nights the grass and every leaf and stalk are laden with frost through which the morning t i each to a precious diamond the colors of the rainbow the brook are across and across with slender of ice the mountains of but both these and the grass are melted before midday and notwithstanding the great elevation of the meadow the are still warm enough to revive the chilled and call them out to enjoy the late the divine the surrounding forest every evening followed by a crystal night with hosts of lily stars whose size and brilliancy cannot be conceived by those who have never risen above the thus come and go the bright sun 
57,days of autumn not a cloud in the sky week after week until near december then comes a sudden change clouds of a peculiar aspect with a slow crawling gait gather and grow in the throwing out and becoming gradually darker until every lake like and opening is closed and the whole bent is ed in equal gloom then comes the snow for the clouds are ripe the meadows of the sky are in bloom and shed their radiant blossoms like an orchard in the spring lightly lightly they lodge in the brown and in the needles of the pines falling hour after hour day after day silently lovingly â all the winds hushed â glancing and hither thither against one another rays in as large as and then the and the trees and the stones are all equally again thunder showers occur here ing the summer months and impressive it is to watch the coming of the big transparent drops each a small world in itself â one unbroken ocean without islands free through the air like i the meadows through space but still more impressive to me is the coming of the snow flowers â falling stars winter â giving bloom to all the ground alike blossom brilliantly in the rainbow and change to flowers in the sod but snow comes in full flower direct from the dark frozen sky the later snow storms are accompanied by winds that break up the when the temperature is low into single and irregular dusty fragments but there is comparatively little drifting on the meadow so securely is it in the woods from december to may storm storm until the snow is about fifteen or twenty feet deep but the surface is always as smooth as the breast of a bird hushed now is the life that so late was beating warmly most of the birds have gone down below the snow line the plants sleep and all the fly wings are folded yet the sun beams many a day in casting long lance shadows the dazzling expanse in june small of the dead sod begin to appear gradually and with one another covered with creeping rags of water the day and ice by night looking as hopeless and as crushed rocks just emerging from the darkness of the period walk the meadow now i scarce the memory of a flower will you find the ground seems twice dead nevertheless the annual is drawing near the life giving sun his floods the last snow wreath of growing points push eagerly through the steaming tlie birds come back new wings the the mountains of and life comes on seemingly yet more glorious than before this is a perfect meadow and under favorable circumstances exists without any marked changes for centuries nevertheless soon or late it must inevitably grow old and vanish during the calm indian summer scarce a sand grain moves around its banks but in flood times and storm times soil is washed forward upon it and laid in successive sheets around its gently sloping rim and is gi extended to the making it through a considerable period the meadow vegetation is not greatly affected thereby for it rises with the rising ground keeping on the surface like water plants rising on the swell of waves but at length the elevation of the goes on so far as to produce too dry a soil for the specific meadow plants when of course they have to give up their places to others fitted for the new conditions the most characteristic of the at this elevation above the sea are principally sun loving and and finally forest trees the changes are so manifold that the original can be and seen only by the generally speaking lakes vanish more slowly than the meadows that succeed them because unless very shallow a greater quantity of material is required to fill up their and them than is required to render the surface of the meadow too high and dry for meadow vegetation the meadows owing to the to which the adjacent rocks are subjected material of the finer sort susceptible of by rains and ordinary floods is abundant the meadow period than the lake period yet doubtless many a fine meadow situated exists in almost prime beauty for thousands of years the process of being exceedingly slow as we reckon time this is especially the case with meadows like the one we have described â in deep woods with the gi rising gently away from it all around the of tree roots in which all the ground is clasped preventing any rapid washing but in exceptional cases beautiful formed with great deliberation are overwhelmed and at once by the action of land slips

of greatest waving up and down over rock heaps and like rich green ribbons brilliantly with tall flowers they occur both in the and regions in considerable numbers and never fail to make telling f es in the landscape they are often a mile or more in length but never very wide â usually from thirty to fifty yards when the mountain or side on which they lie at the required angle and other conditions are at the same time favorable they extend from above the the meadows timber line to the bottom of a or lake basin descending in fine lines like breaking here and there into a kind of spray on large or dividing and flowing around on either side of some projecting sometimes a noisy stream goes down through them and again scarcely a drop of water is in sight they owe their existence however to streams whether visible or invisible the wildest specimens being found where some fountain as a or or spring sends down its waters across a rough sheet of soil in a dissipated web of feeble these conditions give rise to a vegetation whose extending roots still more the free flow of the waters and tend to them out over a yet wider area thus the soil and the necessary moisture requisite for the better class of meadow plants are at times combined about as perfectly as if smoothly on a level surface where the soil happens to be composed of the finer qualities of and the water is not in excess the nearest approach is made by the vegetation to that of the lake meadow but where as is more commonly the case the soil is coarse and the vegetation is rank tall wide take their places along the sides and rushes and nodding in the portions mingled with the most beautiful and imposing flowers â orange lilies and seven or eight feet high painted cups many species of and the ample boat and the magnificent the mountains op with spurs an inch and a half long at an elevation of from seven to nine thousand feet flowers frequently form the bulk of the vegetation then the hanging meadows become hanging gardens in rare instances we find an basin the bottom of which is a perfect meadow and the sides nearly all the way round rising in gentle curves are covered with soil which being with melting snow from fountains gives rise to an almost continuous of down meadow vegetation that gracefully into the level meadow at the bottom thus forming a grand smooth soft meadow lined mountain nest it is in meadows of this sort that the mountain loves to make his home snug chambers beneath the sod digging turning the waters from channel to channel to suit his convenience and feeding the vegetation another kind of meadow or occurs on where small streams have been at short intervals by fallen trees still another kind is found hanging down smooth flat while corresponding leaning meadows rise to

of plant beauty chapter the forests the forests of the are the and most in the world and grow in a delightful climate on the most interesting and accessible of mountain yet strange to say they are not well known more than sixty years ago david an enthusiastic and tree lover wandered alone through fine sections of the sugar pine and silver fir woods wild with delight a few years later other made short journeys from the coast into the lower woods then came the wonderful multitude of into the foot hill mostly blind with gold dust soon followed by who with wool over their eyes chased their flocks through all the forest from one end of the range to the other then the valley was discovered and thousands of admiring passed through sections of the lower and middle on their way to that wonderful park and gained fine glimpses of the sugar pines and silver along the edges of dusty and roads but few indeed strong and free with eyes with care have gone far enough and lived long enough with the trees to gain anything like a loving conception of their grandeur and the mountains of significance as manifested in the of their distribution and varying aspects throughout the seasons as they stand arrayed in their winter garb rejoicing in storms putting forth their fresh leaves in the spring while steaming with fragrance receiving the thunder showers of summer or heavy laden with ripe in the rich of autumn for knowledge of this kind one must dwell with the trees and grow with them without any reference to time in the sense the distribution of the general forest in is readily perceived these as we have seen extend in regular order from one of the range to the other and however dense and they may appear in general views neither on the rocky heights nor down in the hollows will you find anything to remind you of the of the and with their boundless of shade the monotonous of the forests of the the black forest of europe or the dense dark woods of where rolls the the giant pines and and hold their arms open to the sunlight rising above one another on the mountain benches in glorious array giving forth the utmost expression of grandeur and beauty with inexhaustible variety and harmony the inviting of the woods is one of their most characteristics the trees of all the species stand more or less apart in groves or in 
58,small irregular groups one to find a way nearly everywhere along sunny and through that have a smooth view in the the mountains of park like surface strewn with brown needles and now you cross a wild garden now a meadow now a stream and ever and anon you from all the groves and flowers upon some granite pavement or high bare ridge commanding superb views above the waving sea of far and near one would experience but little difficulty in riding on horseback through the successive all the way up to the storm beaten of the icy peaks the deep however that extend from the of the range cut the more or less into sections and prevent the mounted from tracing them this simple arrangement in and sections brings the forest as a whole within the comprehension of every observer the different species are ever found occupying the same relative positions to one another as controlled by soil climate and the comparative vigor of each species in taking and holding the ground and so are these relations one need never be at a loss in within a few hundred feet the elevation above sea level by the trees alone for notwithstanding some of the species range upward for several thousand feet and all pass one another more or less yet even those possessing the greatest range are available in this connection in as much as they take on new forms corresponding with the variations in crossing the plains of the and san from the west and reaching the foot hills you enter the lower fringe of the the f ee tb forest composed of small oaks and pines growing so far apart that not one twentieth of the surface of the ground is in shade at clear after advancing fifteen or twenty miles and making an ascent of from two to three thousand feet yon reach of the line oh the lower margin of the main pine composed of the gigantic sugar pine yellow pine and next you come to the magnificent silver fir belt and lastly to the upper pine belt which sweeps up the rocky of the peaks in a wavering fringe to a height of from ten to twelve thousand feet the mountains of this general order of distribution with reference to climate dependent on elevation is perceived at once but there are other as far reaching in this connection that become manifest only after patient observation and study perhaps the most interesting of these is the arrangement of the forests in long bands together patterns and in charming variety the key to this beautiful harmony is the ancient where they flowed the trees followed tracing their wavering courses along over and over high the of says are growing upon one of the of an ancient all the forests of the are growing upon but vanish like the that make them every storm that falls upon them them cutting and carrying away their material into new until at length they are no longer by any save students who trace their forms down from the fresh still in process of formation through those that are more and more ancient and more and more obscured by vegetation and all kinds of post had the ice sheet that once covered all the range been melted simultaneously from the foot hills to the the would of course have been left almost bare of soil and these noble forests would be wanting many groves and would undoubtedly have grown up on lake and beds and many a fair flower and would have found food and a dwelling place in the f be s and but the as a whole would have beau a bare rocky desert it appears therefore that the a forests in general indicate the extent and positions of the ancient as well as they do lines of climate for forests properly speaking cannot exist soil and since the have been deposited upon the solid rock and only upon elected places the mountains of leaving a considerable portion of the old surface bare we find luxuriant forests of pine and

first visit to the pacific coast was made in the year the indians watched him with curiosity as he wandered in the woods collecting specimens and unlike the fur gathering strangers they had hitherto known caring nothing about trade and when at length they came to know him better and saw that from year to year the gi owing things of the woods and were his only objects of pursuit they called him the man of grass a title of which he was proud during his first summer on the waters of the he made fort his making excursions from this bay post in every direction on one of his long he saw in an indian s some of the seeds of a new species of pine which he learned were obtained from a very large tree far to the southward of the at the end of the next summer returning to fort after the setting in of the winter rains bearing in mind the big pine he 
58,had heard of he set out on an excursion up the valley in search of it and how he and what dangers and hardships he endured are best told in his own journal from which i quote as follows october weather dull cold and cloudy when my friends in england are made acquainted with my travels i fear they will think i have told them nothing but my miseries i quitted my camp early in the morning to survey the neighboring country leaving my guide to take charge of the horses until my return in the evening about an hour s walk from the camp i met an indian who on perceiving me instantly strung his bow the mountains of placed on his left arm a sleeve of skin and stood on the being quite sure that conduct was prompted by fear and not by hostile intentions the poor fellow having probably never seen such a being as myself before i laid my gun at my feet on the ground and waved my hand for him to come to me which he did slowly and with great caution i then made him place his bow and quiver of arrows beside my gun and striking a light gave him a smoke out of my own pipe and a present of a few beads with my pencil i made a rough sketch of the and pine tree which i wanted to obtain and drew his attention to it when he instantly pointed with his hand to the hills fifteen or twenty miles distant towards the south and when i expressed my intention of going thither cheerfully set out to accompany me at midday i reached my long wished f or pines and lost no time in examining them and to collect specimens and seeds new and strange things seldom fail to make strong impressions and are therefore frequently over so that lest i should never see my friends in england to inform them of this most beautiful and immensely grand tree i shall here state the dimensions of the largest i could find among several that had been blown down by the wind at feet from the ground its is feet inches at feet feet inches the extreme length feet as it was impossible either to climb the tree or it down i endeavored to knock off the by firing at them with ball when the report of my gun brought eight indians all of them painted with red earth armed with bows arrows bone tipped and they appeared anything but friendly i explained to them what i wanted and they seemed satisfied and sat down to smoke but presently i saw one of them string his bow and another his flint knife with a pair of wooden and it on the wrist of his right hand further testimony of their intentions was the to save myself by flight was impossible so without hesitation i stepped back about five paces cocked my gun di one of the pistols out of my belt and holding it in my left hand and the gun in my right showed myself determined to fight for my life as much as possible i endeavored to preserve my coolness and thus we stood looking at one another without making any movement or uttering a word for perhaps ten minutes when one at last who seemed to be the leader gave a sign that they wished for some tobacco this i signified that they should have if they fetched a quantity of they went off immediately in search of them and no sooner were they all out of sight than i picked up my three and some twigs of the trees and made the possible retreat hurrying back to the camp which i reached before dusk i now write lying on the grass with my gun cocked beside me and these lines by the light of my candle namely an piece of wood this grand pine discovered under such exciting circumstances named in honor of his friend dr of london the trunk is a smooth round delicately shaft mostly without limbs and colored rich brown usually with of yellow at the top of this magnificent long cm branches sweep gracefully outward and downward sometimes forming a palm like crown but far more nobly impressive than any palm crown i ever beheld the needles are about three inches long finely tempered and arranged in rather close at the ends of slender that clothe the long limbs how well they sing in the wind and how strikingly harmonious an effect the mountains of is made by the immense that depend loosely from the ends of the main branches i no one knows what nature can do in the way of pine until he has seen those of the sugar pine they are commonly from fifteen to eighteen inches long and three in green shaded with dark purple on their sides they are ripe in september and october then the flat scales open and the seeds take wing but the empty become stiu more beautiful and effective for their is nearly doubled by the ng of the scales and their color changes to a warm brown while they remain swinging on the tree all the following winter and and continue beautiful even on the gi many years after they fall the wood is fragrant and fine in grain and texture it is of a rich cream yellow as if formed of the glory of eastern forests is called fu si no ki tree of the sun by the the sugar pine is the sun tree of the unfortunately it is greatly by the and in accessible places is always the first tree in the woods to feel their steel but the regular with their saw mills have been less generally destructive thus far than the the wood freely and there is a constant demand for the and because an ax and saw 
59,and f row are all the capital required for the business many of that drifting unsteady class of men so large in engage in it for a few months in the year when hunters hands etc touch their bottom dollar and the find themselves out of employment they say well i can at least go to the sugar pines and make a few posts are set in the ground and a single length cut from the first tree produces boards enough for the walls and roof of a cabin all the rest the makes is for sale and he is speedily independent no gardener or is more sweetly than these rough while engaged in this business but the they make is most deplorable the sugar from which the common name is derived is to my taste the best of sweets â better than sugar it from the where wounds made either by forest es or the pins the mountains of ax in the shape of crisp like which are crowded together in masses of considerable size like clusters of beads when fresh it is perfectly white and delicious but because most of the wounds on which it is found have been made by fire the sap is stained on the surface and the hardened sugar becomes brown indians are fond of it but on account of its properties only small quantities may be eaten bears so fond of sweet things in general seem never to taste it at least i have failed to find any trace of their teeth in this connection no lover of trees will ever forget his first meeting with the sugar pine nor will he ward need a poet to call him to listen what the pine tree in most pine trees there is a of expression which to most people is apt to become monotonous for the typical form however beautiful affords but little scope for individual character the sugar pine is as free from of form and motion as any oak no two are alike even to the most observer and notwithstanding they are ever tossing out their immense arms in what might seem most extravagant gestures there is a majesty and repose about them that all possibility of the grotesque or even picturesque in their general expression they are the priests of pines and seem ever to be addressing the surrounding forest the yellow pine is found growing with them on warm and the white silver fir on cool northern slopes but noble as these are the sugar pine is easily king and his arms above them in blessing while they the forests rock and wave in sign of recognition the main branches are sometimes found to be forty feet in length yet persistently simple seldom dividing at all excepting near the end but anything like a bare cable ance is prevented by the that extend all around them and when these superb limbs sweep out on all sides a crown sixty or seventy feet wide is formed which gracefully poised on the summit of the noble shaft and filled with sunshine is one of the most glorious forest objects conceivable commonly however there is a great of limbs toward the east away from the direction of the prevailing winds no other pine seems to me so and in approaching it we feel as if in the presence of a superior being and begin to walk with a light step holding our breath then perchance while we gaze awe stricken along comes a el chattering and laughing to break the spell up the trunk with no ceremony and off the as if they were made only for him while the carpenter away at the bark holes in which to store his winter supply of although so wild and when the sugar pine is a remarkably proper tree in youth the old is the most original and independent in appearance of all the the young is the most regular â a strict of fashions â slim erect with leafy branches

superior powers of enduring variations of climate and soil it has a more extensive range than any other gi owing on the on the slope it is first met at an elevation of about feet and extends nearly to

manners more graceful and its beauty is of a kind more easily appreciated but then it is on the other hand much less dignified and original in the silver pine seems eager to shoot aloft even while it is in autumn sun gold you may still detect a but the sugar pine seems too unconsciously noble and too complete in every way to leave room for even a care the mountains of ix tree is the king of the 
59,as the sugar pine is king of pines it is by far the most majestic i ever beheld in any forest and one of the largest and longest lived of the giants that flourish throughout the main pine belt

are handsomely with the short leaves which at right angles all around them this is ever beautiful the mountain winds and the snow as well as the mellow summer light and maintaining its youthful freshness from century to century through a thousand storms it makes its finest appearance in the months of june and july the rich brown with which its are tipped swell and break about this time revealing the young leaves which at first are bright yellow making the tree appear as if covered with gay blossoms while the with their shell like scales are a constant the young trees are mostly gathered into beautiful family groups each exquisitely the branches are regularly around the generally in while each is draped with long that descend in curves as free and as finely di as those of falling water the forests in and washington it grows in dense forests growing tall and mast like to a height of feet and is greatly as a lumber ti ee but in the it is scattered among other trees or forms small groves seldom ascending higher than feet and never making what would be called a forest it is not particular in its choice of soil â wet or dry smooth or rocky it makes out to live well on

growing upon blocks of gi that have been shaken from the front of the liberty cap near the fall no other tree seems so capable of itself to earthquake and many of these rough slopes are occupied by it

ridge top the color alone of its is sufficient to identify it in any company in youth say up to the age of seventy or eighty years no other tree forms so strictly a from top to bottom the branches outward and downward in bold curves excepting the younger ones near the top which while the lowest to the gi and all spread out in flat beautifully and upon one another as it becomes older it grows

feeding in the between the groves and birds and in the branches make a pleasant stir which the deep brooding calm of the wilderness and gives a peculiar to every tree no wonder the enthusiastic went wild with joy when he first discovered this species even in the where so many noble challenge admiration we linger among these colossal the mountains of with fresh love and their beauty again and again as if no other in the world could henceforth claim our regard it is in these woods the great granite rise that are so striking and characteristic a feature of the and here too we find the best of the garden meadows they lie level on the tops of the dividing or sloping on the sides of them in the magnificent forest some of these meadows are in great part occupied by which here gi rank and tall with leaves thirteen inches long and twelve inches wide like those of gi on the with tall and waist deep in and several of also make a bright show in beds of blue and white and but the glory of these forest meadows is a lily â l the flowers are orange and quite small the smallest i ever saw of the true lilies but it is nevertheless for it is seven to eight feet high and waves magnificent of ten to twenty flowers or more over one s head while it stands out in the open ground with just enough of grass and other plants about it to make a fringe for its feet and show it off to best advantage a spot a little way back from the margin of a silver fir lily garden makes a glorious especially where the slope is toward the east and opens a view of the distant peaks along the of the range the tall lilies are brought forward in all their glory by the light of your blazing camp e relieved against the outer darkness the forests and the nearest of the trees with their branches tower above you like larger lilies and the sky seen through the garden opening seems one vast meadow of white lily stars in the morning everything is joyous and bright the delicious purple of the dawn changes softly to yellow and white while the pouring through the passes between the peaks give a margin of gold to each of them then the of the in the hollows of the middle region catch the glow and camp grove is filled with light the birds begin to stir seeking sunny branches on the edge of the meadow for sun after the cold night and looking for their every one of them as fresh as a and as innumerable insects

with life 
60,and is felt brooding over everything great and small big tree between the heavy pine and silver fir we find the big tree the king of all the in the world the noblest of a noble race it extends in a widely interrupted belt from a small grove on the middle fork of the american river to the head of deer creek a distance of about miles the the mountains of limit being near the thirty ninth parallel the southern a little below the thirty sixth and the elevation of the belt above the sea from about to feet from the american river grove to the forest on king s river the species s only in small isolated groups so distributed along the belt that three of the in it are from forty to sixty miles wide but from king s river southward the is not to mere gi but extends across the broad of the and rivers in noble forests a distance of nearly seventy miles the of this part of the belt being broken only by deep the the largest of the northern groves an area of three or four square miles a short distance to the southward of the famous grove along the rim of the of the south fork of king s river there is a majestic forest of about six miles long by two wide this is the assemblage of big trees that may fairly be called a forest descending the divide between the king s river and you enter the grand forests that form the main continuous portion of the belt advancing southward the giants become more and more heaving their massive crowns into the sky from every ridge and slope and waving onward in graceful compliance with the complicated of the region the finest of the section of the belt is on the broad ridge between marble creek and the middle fork and extends from the granite overlooking the hot plains to within a few the miles of the cool fountains of the summit peaks the extreme upper limit of the belt is reached between the middle and south forks of the at an elevation of feet but the finest block of big tree forest in the entire belt is on the north fork of in the gi there are comparatively few young trees or but here for every old storm stricken giant there are many in all the glory of prime vigor and for each of these a crowd of eager hopeful young trees and growing heartily on rocky along and in the moist of meadows seemingly in hot pursuit of eternal life but though the area occupied by the species in so much from north to south there is no marked increase in the size of the trees a height of feet and a near the gi of about feet is perhaps about the average size of trees situated specimens feet in are not very rare and a few are nearly feet high in the grove there are trees over feet in height the of which by careful is feet the largest i have yet met in the se of my is a majestic old monument in the king s river forest it is feet inches in inside the bark four feet from the ground under the most favorable conditions these giants probably live years or more though few of even the larger trees are more than half as old i never saw a big tree that had died a natural death accidents they seem to be immortal the mountains of being from all the diseases that and kill other trees unless destroyed by man they live on until burned smashed by lightning or cast down by storms or by the giving way of the ground on which they stand the age of one that was in the grove for the sake of having its stump for a dancing floor was about years and its measured across the stump feet inside the bark another that was cut down in the king s river forest was about the same size but nearly a thousand years older years though not a very old looking tree it was to e a section for exhibition and thus an opportunity was given to count its annual rings of growth the colossal monument in the king s river forest mentioned above is burned half through and i spent a day in making an estimate of its age clearing away the surface with an ax and carefully counting the annual rings with the aid of a pocket the wood rings in the section i laid bare were so involved and in some places that i was not able to determine its age exactly but i counted over rings which showed that this tree was in its prime swaying in the winds when christ walked the earth no other tree in the world as far as i know has looked down on so many as the or opens such impressive and suggestive views into history so exquisitely harmonious and finely balanced are even the very of these of the woods in all their proportions and circumstances there never is anything overgrown or monstrous the looking about them on coming in sight of them for the st time you are likely to say oh see what beautiful noble looking trees are towering there among the s and pines â then grandeur being in the mean time in great part invisible but to the living eye it will be manifested sooner or later stealing slowly on the senses like the gi of or the lofty their great size is hidden from the inexperienced ver as long as they are seen at a distance in one harmonious view when however you approach them and walk round them you begin to wonder at their colossal size and seek a measuring rod these giants considerably at the base but not more than is required 
60,for beauty and safety and the only reason that this seems in some cases excessive is that only a comparatively small section of the shaft is seen at once in near views one that i ed in the king s river forest was feet in at the ground and feet in feet above the ground showing that the of the ti as a whole is fine and when you stand back far enough to see the massive columns from the swelling to the lofty summit in a dome of e you rejoice in the display of combined and beauty about a hundred feet or more of the trunk is ally but its massive simplicity is relieved by the bark which instead of making an irregular run parallel like the of an column and to some extent by of slender that wave lightly in the winds and cast the mountains of of shade seeming to have been pinned on here and there for the sake of beauty only the young trees have slender simple branches down to the gi put on with strict regularity sharply at the top about half way down and drooping in handsome curves at the base by the time the is five or six ed years old this habit into the rounded dome form of middle age which in turn takes on the eccentric of old age no other tree in the a forest has foliage so or presents outlines so drawn and so steadily subordinate to a special type a looking branch five to eight feet thick may be seen pushing out abruptly from the smooth trunk as if sm e to throw the regular curve into confusion but as soon as the general outline is reached it stops short and in spreading of law abiding just as if every tree were growing beneath some huge invisible bell glass against whose sides every branch was being pressed and yet somehow indulging in so many small from the regular form that there is still an appearance of freedom the foliage of the is dark green in color while the older trees to a warm yellow tint like the bark is rich brown in young trees and in shady portions of the old while the ground is covered with brown leaves and forming of extraordinary richness not to mention the flowers and that rejoice about them in their seasons walk the woods at any time the forests of year and you will say they are the most beautiful and majestic on earth beautiful and impressive meet you everywhere the colors of tree and flower rock and sky light and shade strength and endurance and of bushes tree pillars about as rigid as granite roses and the smallest of their kind blooming around the feet of the giants and of the lowly where the fall then in winter the trees themselves break forth in bloom of small four sided crowd the ends of the slender

many seeds millions are by a single tree and in a fruitful year the product of one of the northern groves would be enough to plant all the mountain of the world nature takes care however that not one

the happy of most of the out of every hundred perhaps ninety fall to his share and unless cut off by his ivory they shake out their seeds and remain on the tree for many years watching the at their harvest work in the indian is one of the most delightful imaginable the woods are and the ripe colors are blazing in all their glory the laden ti stand motionless in the warm air and you may see the crimson the prince of some dead limb or fallen trunk with his bill and ever and anon filling the with his happy the humming bird too dwells in these noble woods and may be seen glancing among the flowers or resting on some here also are the familiar robin of the and the brown and bears so obviously fitted for these majestic and the making more vital stir than all the bears birds and humming wings together as soon as any accident happens to the crown of these such as being stricken off by lightning or broken by storms then the branches beneath the wound no matter how situated seem to be excited like a colony of bees that have lost their queen and become anxious to repair the damage limbs that have grown outward for centuries at right angles to the trunk begin to turn upward to the forests assist in making a new crown each speedily assuming the special form of true even in the case of mere burned half through some mere ornamental will try to go aloft and do its best as a leader in forming a new head groups of two or three of these grand trees are often found standing close the seeds from which they sprang having probably grown on ground cleared for their reception by the fall 
60,of a large tree of a former generation these patches of fresh mellow soil beside tlie roots of the fallen giant may be from forty to sixty feet wide and they are speedily occupied by out of these perhaps two or three may become trees forming those close groups called three graces loving couples etc for even supposing that the trees should stand twenty or thirty feet apart while young l y the time they are their trunks touch and crowd against each other and even appear as one in some cases it is generally believed that this grand was once far more widely distributed over the but after long and careful study i have come to the conclusion that it never was at least since the close of the period l a search along the of the groves and in the between fails to reveal a single trace of its previous existence beyond its present bounds notwithstanding i feel confident that if every in the range were to die to day numerous monuments of their existence would remain of so a nature as to be available for the student more than ten thousand years hence the mountains of in the first place we might notice that no species of tree in the range keeps its individuals so well together as a mile is perhaps the greatest distance of any from the main body and all of those that have come under my observation are young instead of old trees of a more extended growth again trunks frequently endure for centuries after they f all i have a specimen block cut from a fallen trunk which is hardly from specimens cut from living trees although the old trunk fragment from which it was derived has lain in the damp forest more than years probably thrice as long the time measure in the case is simply this when the ponderous trunk to which the old belonged fell it sunk itself into the ground thus making a long straight ditch and in the middle of this ditch a silver fir is growing that is now four feet in and years old as determined by cutting it half through and counting the rings thus that the remnant of the trunk that made the ditch has lain on the ground more than years for it is evident that to find the whole time we must add to the years the time that the vanished portion of the trunk lay in the ditch before being burned out of the way the time that passed before the seed from which the fir sprang fell into the prepared soil and took root now because trunks are never wholly consumed in one forest fire and those fires only at considerable intervals and because after being cleared are often left for it becomes the evident that the trunk remnant in question may probably have lain a thousand years or more and this instance is by no means a rare one but admitting that upon those supposed to have been once covered with every tree may have fallen and every may have been burned or buried leaving not a remnant many of the made by the fall of the ponderous trunks and the made by their turning roots would remain patent for thousands of years after the last of the trunks that made them had vanished much of tliis ditch writing would no doubt be quickly by the flood action of overflowing streams and rain washing but no portion would remain engraved on ridge tops beyond such destructive action for where all the conditions are favorable it is almost these historic and root occur in all the present groves a nd forests hut as far as i have not the faintest of one presents itself outside of them we therefore conclude that the area covered by has not been diminished during the last eight or ten thousand years and probably not at all in post times is the species to f what are its relations to climate and associated trees f all the phenomena bearing on these questions also throw light as we shall endeavor to show upon the peculiar distribution of tlie species and sustain the conclusion already at on the question of extension in the groups as we have seen there the mountains of are few young trees or growing up around the failing old ones to the race and in as much as those aged so nearly are the only ones commonly known the species to most seems doomed to speedy as being nothing more than an remnant in the so called struggle for life by pines and that have driven it into its last in moist where climate is favorable but the language of the majestic continuous forests of the south a very different impression no tree of all the forest is more in with climate and soil it grows heartily everywhere â on rocky along and in the deep moist of meadows with a multitude of and crowding up around the aged seemingly abundantly able to maintain the forest in prime vigor for every old tree there is one or more in all the glory of prime and for each of these many young trees and crowds of so that if all the trees of any section of the main forest were ranged together according to age a very promising curve would be presented all the way up from last year s to giants and with the young and middle aged portion of the curve many times longer than the old portion even as far north as the i counted and growing upon a piece of rough soil not exceeding two acres in area this soil bed is about seven years old and has been almost simultaneously by pines and the presenting a simple and instructive illustration of the struggle for life among the rival species and it was interesting to note that the conditions 
60,thus far affecting them have enabled the young to gain a marked advantage in every instance like the above t have observed that the is capable of growing on both and soil than its rivals but requires more sunshine than they the latter fact being clearly shown wherever a sugar pine or is gi owing in close contact with a of about equal age and size and equally exposed to the sun the branches of the latter in such cases are always less leafy toward the south however where the becomes more and numerous the rival trees become less so and where they mix with they mostly grow up beneath them like slender gi among of indian corn upon a bed of sandy flood soil i counted ninety four from one to twelve feet high on a patch of gi once occupied by four large sugar pines which lay crumbling beneath them â an instance of conditions which have enabled to crowd out the pines i also noted eighty six vigorous upon a piece of fresh ground prepared for their reception by fire thus fire the great of also bare vii gin ground one of the conditions essential for its gi from tlie seed fresh ground is however furnished in sufficient quantities for the constant renewal of the forests without fire by the fall of old trees the soil is thus and and many trees are planted the mountains of for every one that falls land slips and floods also give rise to bare vii gin ground and a tree now and then owes its existence to a wolf or but the most regular supply of fresh soil is furnished by the fall of aged trees the changes in progress in the bearing on the of tree life are entirely especially as to the time and the means employed by nature in them it is constantly asserted in a vague way that the was vastly than now and that the increasing will of itself leaving its ground to other trees supposed capable of flourishing in a climate but that can and does grow on as dry ground as any of its present rivals is manifest in a thousand places why then it will be asked are always foimd in greatest abundance in well watered places where streams are abundant f simply because a growth of those streams the thirsty knows well that in every gi he will find running water but it is a mistake to suppose that the water is the cause of the grove being there on the contrary the grove is the cause of the water being there drain off the water and the trees will remain but cut off the trees and the streams will vanish never was cause more completely mistaken for effect than in the case of these related phenomena of woods and streams and i confess that at first i shared in the blunder when attention is called to the method of stream making it will be apprehended at once the the roots of this immense tree fill the ground forming a thick that and holds back the rains and melting only allowing them to and flow gently indeed every fallen leaf and as well as long clasping root and prostrate may be regarded as a dam the of storm clouds and it as blessings all through the summer instead of allowing it to go headlong in short lived floods is also checked by the dense foliage to a greater extent than by any other tree and the air is entangled in masses and broad sheets that are quickly while thirsty winds are not allowed to go and along the gi so great is the of water in many places in the main belt that and meadows are created by the killing of the trees a single trunk falling across a stream in the woods forms a dam feet long and from ten to thirty feet high giving rise to a pond which the trees within its reach these dead trees fall in turn thus making a clearing while gradually changing the pond into a or meadow for a growth of and in some instances a series of small or meadows rise above one another on a which are gradually into one another forming sloping or meadows which make striking features of woods and since all the trees that have fallen into them have been preserved they contain records of the generations that have passed since they began to form since then it is a fact that thousands of are growing on what is termed dry ground the mountains of and even clinging like mountain pines to in granite and since it has also been shown that the extra moisture found in connection with the is an effect of their presence instead of a cause of their presence then the notions as to the former extension of the species and its near approach to based upon its supposed dependence on greater moisture are seen to be the in the rain and since the close of the period in the is much less than is commonly guessed the highest post are well preserved in all the upper river channels and they are not greatly higher than the spring of the present showing that no extraordinary has taken place in the volume of the upper of streams since they came into existence but in the mean time all this complicated question of change the plain fact remains that the present rain and snow all is abundantly sufficient for the luxuriant growth of forests indeed all my observations tend to show that in a prolonged the sugar pines and would perish before the not alone because of the greater of individual trees but because the species can endure more and make the most of whatever moisture falls again if the and irregular distribution of the species be interpreted as a result of the of the range 
61,then instead of increasing as it does in individuals toward the south where the is less it should the forests k then the peculiar distribution of has not been governed by superior conditions of soil as to or moisture by what has it been governed f in the course of my studies i observed that the northern gi the only ones i was at first acquainted with were on just those portions of the general forest soil belt that were first laid bare toward the close of the period when the ice sheet began to break up into individual and while searching the wide basin of the san and trying to account for the absence of where every condition seemed favorable for its gi it occurred to me that this remarkable gap in the belt is exactly in the basin of the vast ancient de of the san and king s river which poured its frozen floods to the plain fed by the that fell on more than fifty miles of the summit i then perceived that the next great gap in the belt to the northward forty miles wide extending between the and groves occurs in the basin of the great ancient de of the and and that the smaller gap between the and groves occurs in the basin of the smaller of the the the ancient the the corresponding gap in the belt finally pursuing my across the of the and i discovered that the belt attained its greatest development just where owing to the peculiarities of the region the ground had been most per the mountains of f protected from the main ice s that continued to pour past from the summit fountains long after the smaller local had been melted taking now a general view of the belt beginning at the south we see that the majestic ancient were shed off right and left down the valleys of and king s rivers by the lofty spurs above the warm filled of the and then next northward occurs the wide less channel or basin of the ancient san and bang s river de then the warm protected spots of and groves then the channel of the ancient next the warm sheltered ground of the and groves then the less channel of the grand ancient de of the and then the warm old ground of the and groves it appears therefore that just where at a certain period in the history of the the were not there the is and just where the were there the is not what the other conditions may have been that enabled to establish itself upon these oldest and warmest portions of the main soil belt i cannot say i might venture to state however in this connection that since the forests present a more and more ancient aspect as they extend southward i am inclined to think that the species was distributed from the south while the sugar pine its great rival in the northern groves seems to have come around the head of the the f ee ts and down the from the north consequently when the soil beds were first thrown open to on the melting of the ice sheet the may have established itself along the available portions of the south half of the range prior to the arrival of the sugar pine while the sugar pine took possession of the north half prior to the arrival of but however much uncertainty may attach to this branch of the question there are no shadows upon the grand general relationship we have pointed out between the present distribution of and the ancient of the and when we bear in mind that all the present forests of the are young growing on soil recently deposited and that the flank of the range itself with all its is new born recently and brought to the light of day from beneath the ice mantle of the winter then a thousand lawless mysteries disappear and broad take their places but although all the observed phenomena bearing on the post history of this colossal tree point to the conclusion that it never was more widely distributed on the since the close of the epoch that its present forests are scarcely past prime if indeed they have reached prime that the post day of the species is probably not half done yet when from a wider outlook the vast antiquity of the is considered and its ancient richness in species and individuals comparing our giant and of the coast range the only other living species of se the mountains of with the twelve species already discovered and described by and some of which seem to have flourished over vast in the regions and in europe and our own during and times â then indeed it becomes plain that our two species to within the limits of are mere of the both as to species and individuals and that they probably are to but the verge of a period beginning in times may have a breadth of of thousands of years not to mention the possible existence of conditions calculated to and both species and individuals this however is a branch of the question into which i do not now purpose to enter in studying the fate of om forest king we have thus far considered the action of natural causes only but unfortunately man is in the woods and waste and pure destruction are making rapid if the importance of forests were at all understood even from an their preservation would call forth the most watchful attention of government only of late years by means of forest has the simplest for available been laid while in many of the finest groves every species of destruction is still moving on with speed in the course of my i found no fewer than five mills on or near the lower edge of the belt all of which were 
61,cutting considerable quantities of big tree lumber the forests most of the gi are doomed to feed the mills recently erected near them and a company of are now cutting the magnificent forest on king s river in these operations waste far use for after the choice young trees on any given spot have been the woods are fired to clear the ground of limbs and refuse with reference to f mother operations and of course most of the and are destroyed these mill however are small as ed with the comprehensive caused by incredible numbers of sheep are di to the mountain pastures eveiy summer and their course is ever marked by desolation every wild garden is trodden down the shrubs are stripped of leaves as if ed by and the woods are burned fires are set everywhere with a view to clearing the ground of prostrate trunks to the movements of the flocks and improve the pastures the entire forest belt is thus swept and from one extremity of the range to the other and with the exception of the suffers most of all indians burn off the in certain to f deer hunting and carelessly allow their to run but the fires of the or form more than ninety per cent of all destructive fires that range the forests it appears therefore that notwithstanding our forest king might live on in nature s keeping it is rapidly vanishing before the fire and the mountains of steel of man and unless measures be speedily invented and applied in a few at the farthest all that will be left of will be a few and monuments two or pine this species forms the bulk of the forests extending along the range above the fix up to a height of from to feet above the sea growing in beautiful order upon that are scarcely changed as yet by post compared with the giants of the lower this is a small tree seldom a height of a hundred feet the largest specimen i ever measured was ninety feet in height and a little over six in four feet from the ground the average height of mature trees throughout the entire belt is probably not far from fifty or sixty feet with a of two feet it is a well rather handsome little pine with brown bark and crooked much divided branches which cover the greater portion of the trunk not so however as to prevent its being seen the lower limbs curve downward gi take a position about half way up the trunk then more and more toward the summit thus forming a sharp top the foliage is short and rigid two leaves in a arranged in comparatively long at the ends of the tough the are about two inches the forests long growing in stiff clusters among the needles without making any striking effect except while very young when they are of a vi crimson color and the whole tree appears to be dotted with brilliant flowers the are still more on account of their gi eat abundance often giving a yellow tinge to the whole mass of the foliage and filling the air with no other pine on the range is so regularly planted as this one forests sweep along the sides of the high rocky valleys for miles without interruption still strictly speaking they are not dense for of sunshine and flowers find their way into the darkest places where the trees gi ow and tall gi are specially abundant beneath them gi owing over all the gi in sunshine and shade over extensive like a farmer s crop and as pasture for the multitude of sheep that are driven from the arid plains every summer as soon as the snow is melted the two pine more than any other is subject to by fire the thin bark is and sprinkled with as though it had been down upon it like rain so that even the gi een trees catch fire readily and during strong winds whole forests are destroyed the flames leaping from tree to tree forming one continuous belt of roaring fire that goes and racing onward above the bending woods like the gi ass

dark ni t it lasts however only a few seconds vanishing with rapidity to be succeeded by others along the fire at intervals for weeks at a time â tree after tree flashing and darkening leaving the and branches hardly the heat however is sufficient to kill the trees and in a few years the bark and falls off miles in extent are thus killed and left sending with the branches on and rigid appearing gray in the distance like misty clouds later the branches drop leaving a forest of at length the roots decay and the forlorn trunks are blown down during some storm and piled one upon another the ground until they are consumed by the next fire and leave it ready for a fresh crop the endurance of the species is shown by its wandering occasionally out over the plains with the yellow pine and climbing mountain sides with the dwarf pine clinging to any chance support in and of rocks â always however showing the effects of such hardships in every feature down in sheltered lake hollows on beds of rich it so far from the form as frequently to be taken for a distinct species here it grows in dense like from forty to

clusters of about from three to six or seven becoming as they increase in weight chiefly by the bending of the branches this species is nearly related to the sugar pine and though not half so tall it constantly suggests its noble relative in the way that it extends its long arms and in general habit the mountain pine is met on the upper margin of the fir growing singly in a subdued form in what appear as chance situations without making much impression on the general forest continuing up through the two pines in the same scattered growth it begins to show its character and at an elevation of about feet its noblest development near the middle of the range tossing its tough arms in the frosty air storms and feeding on them and reaching the grand old age of years or red the is a rock tree

forests they spread their shell like scales and allow the brown winged seeds to fly in the mellow air while the empty remain to the tree until the coming of a fresh crop the of all the era are beautiful growing in bright yellow and rose and crimson those of the are the most beautiful of all forming little of blue flowers each on a stem under all conditions sheltered or well fed or ill fed this tree is singularly graceful in habit even at its highest limit upon exposed though to h in dense huddled close together as if for mutual i it still to throw out its in in loveliness while on well

though dead entire groves of young trees from ten to forty feet high are thus eveiy winter like slender but like the and which the heaviest crush not they are safe it is as though this were only nature s method of putting her to sleep instead of leaving them exposed to the biting storms of winter thus warmly wrapped they await the summer the snow becomes soft in the sunshine and at night making the mass hard and compact like ice so that during the months of april and may you can ride a horse over the prostrate groves without catching sight of a single leaf at length the down pouring sunshine sets them free first the elastic tops of the arches begin to appear then one branch after another each springing loose with a gentle rustling sound and at length the whole tree with the assistance of the winds gradually and rises and settles back into its place in the warm air as dry and and fresh as young just out of the some of the finest groves i have yet found are on the slopes of s there are also many charming companies on the head waters of the and san and in general the species is so far from being rare the that you can scarcely fail to find groves of considerable extent in crossing the range choose what pass you may the mountain pine grows beside it and more frequently the two species but there are many beautiful gi individuals or more without a single intruder i wish i had space to write more of the surpassing beauty of this favorite every is sure to regard it with special admiration even seeking only game or gold stop to gaze on first meeting it and to themselves that s a mighty pretty tree some of them adding d d pretty in when its are ripe the little striped and the and the crow make a happy stir in its groves the deer love to lie down beneath its spreading branches bright streams from the snow that is always near ripple through its groves and precious carpets in its shade but the best words only hint its charms come to the mountains and see pine this species forms the extreme edge of the timber line throughout nearly the whole extent of the range on both it is st met gi owing in company with on the upper margin of the belt as an erect tree from fifteen to thirty feet high and from one to two feet in thickness thence it goes straggling up the of the the mountains of summit peaks upon or ci wherever it can a to an elevation of from to feet where it to a mass of prostrate branches with slender u â right shoots each tipped with a short close packed of leaves the bark is smooth op and in some places almost white the fertile grow in rigid s upon the upper branches dark iu color while young and bear l seeds about the size of peas most of which are eaten by two species of and the notable ci ow the the occur in clusters about an inch wide down among the leaves and as they are colored bright they give rise to a lively appearance little looked for in such a tree pines are commonly regarded as sky loving trees that must necessarily or die 
62,this species forms a marked exception creeping lowly in compliance with the most demands of climate yet enduring bravely to a more advanced age than many of its lofty relatives in the sun lands below seen from a distance it would never be taken for a tree of any kind yonder for example is cathedral peak some three miles away with a scattered gi of this pine creeping like over the roof and around the edges of the north nowhere giving any hint of an ascending when approached quite near it still appears and and is so low that one experiences no great difficulty in walking over the top of it yet it is seldom absolutely prostrate at its lowest usually a height of three or four feet with a main trunk and branches and above it as if in ascending they had been checked by a ceiling against which they had gi own and been compelled to spread the winter snow is indeed such a ceiling lasting half the year while the pressed surface is made yet by violent winds armed with cutting sand gi that beat down any shoot that offers to rise much above the general level and ve the dead and branches in beautiful patterns ing nights i have often beneath the arches of this little the mountains op pine the needles which have accumulated for centuries make fine beds a fact weu known to other s such as deer and wild sheep who out oval hollows and lie beneath the larger trees in safe and comfortable concealment the forests the of this lowly dwarf is far greater than would be guessed here for example is a specimen growing at an elevation of feet which seems as though it might be plucked up by the roots for it is only three and a half inches in and its is hardly three feet above the ground cutting it half through and counting the annual rings with the aid of a we find its age to be no less than years here is another telling specimen about the same height years old whose trunk is only six inches in and one of its hardly an eighth of an inch in inside the bark is seventy five years old and so filled with and so well by that we may tie it in knots like a whip cord pine this species is widely distributed throughout the rocky mountains and over all the higher of the many of the great basin between the mountains and the where it is known as white pine in the it is scattered along the eastern flank from bloody southward nearly to the extremity of the range opposite the village of lone pine nowhere forming any portion of the general forest from its peculiar position in loose straggling parties it seems to have been derived from the basin to the eastward where it is abundant the mountains of it is a larger tree than the dwarf pine at an elevation of about feet above the sea it often a height of forty or fifty feet and a of from three to five feet the open freely when ripe and are twice as large as those of the and the foliage and branches are more open having a tendency to sweep out in free wild curves like those of the mountain pine to which it is closely allied it is seldom found lower than feet above sea level but from this elevation it upward over the to the extreme limit of tree growth where in its storm crushed condition it is more like the species throughout and it is one of the principal timber trees gi eat quantities being cut every year for the mines the famous white pine district white pine city and the whit e pine have derived their names from it needle pine this species is in the to the southern portion of the range about the head waters of kings and rivers where it forms extensive forests and in some places the dwarf pine to the extreme limit of tree gi it is first met at an elevation of between and feet and runs up to without seeming to suffer gi from the climate or the of the soil it is a much finer tree than the the f be t f pine instead of growing in and low it in some way to maintain an erect position and usually stands single wherever the young trees are at all sheltered they grow up straight and with delicately and ascending branches terminated with glossy bottle at middle age certain limbs are and pushed far out for the bearing of after the manner of the sugar pine and in old age these branches and cast about in every direction giving rise to very picturesque effects the trunk becomes deep brown and rough like that of tlie mountain while the mountains of the young are of a strange dull blue color clustered on the upper branches when ripe they are from three to four inches long brown resembling in every way those of the mountain pine excepting the sugar pine no tree on the mountains is so capable of individual expression while in grace of form and movement it constantly reminds one of the the largest specimen i measured was a little over five feet in and ninety feet in height but this is more than twice the ordinary size this species is common throughout the rocky mountains and most of the short of the great basin where it is called the fox tail pine from its long dense leaf on the hot creek white pine and golden gate it is quite abundant about a foot or eighteen inches of the ends of the branches is packed with needles which like an electric fox or el s tail the needles have a glossy polish and the sunshine through them makes them burn with while their 
62,number and elastic temper tell delightfully in the winds this tree is here still more original and than in the far surpassing not only its companion in this respect but also the most of the oaks some stand firmly erect with radiant down to the ground slender towers of shining others with two or three branches pushed out at right angles to the trunk and clad with take the form of beautiful ornamental crosses again in the same woods you the f best find trees that are made up of several united near the gi spreading at the sides in a plane parallel to the of the mountain with the elegant hung in charming order between them making a harp held against the main wind lines where they are most effective in playing the grand and besides these there are many forms alone or in groups with innumerable drooping beneath the arches or radiant above them and many lowly giants of no particular form that have the storms of a thousand years but whether old or young sheltered or exposed to the wildest this tree is ever found and picturesque and offers a richer and more varied series of forms to the artist than any other i know of nut pine the nut pine covers or rather the eastern flank of the to which it is mostly in bush like patches from the margin of the sage plains to an elevation of from to feet a more fruitful and could not be conceived all the species we have been make more or less distant from the typical spire form but none goes so far as this without any apparent of climate or soil it remains near the ground throwing out crooked branches like an orchard the mountains of apple tree and seldom a single shoot higher than fifteen or twenty feet above the ground the average thickness of the trunk is perhaps about ten or twelve inches the leaves are mostly like round instead of being separated like those of other pines into and and the are green while growing and are usually found over all the tree forming quite a marked feature as seen against the gray foliage they are quite small only about two inches in length and give no promise of nuts but when we come to open them we find that about half the entire bulk of the is made up of sweet seeds the of which are nearly as large as those of nuts this is undoubtedly the most important on the and the and river indians with more and better nuts than all the other species taken together it is the indians own tree and many a white man have they killed for cutting it down in its development nature seems to have aimed at the formation of as great a fruit bearing surface as possible being so low and accessible the are readily beaten off with poles and the nuts procured by them until the scales open in seasons a single indian will gather thirty or forty of them â a fine employment of all the along the eastern base of the and on all the many mountain groups and short of the great basin this little pine is the commonest tree and the most the forests nearly every mountain is planted with it to a height of from to feet above the sea some are covered from base to summit by this one species with only a growth of on the lower slopes to break the of its curious woods which though dark looking at a distance are and have none of the damp leafy and hollows so characteristic of other pine woods of thousands of acres occur in continuous indeed viewed the entire basin seems to be pretty divided into level plains dotted with sage bushes and mountain chains covered with nut pines no slope is too rough none too dry for these or of the red man the value of this species to is not easily it fm and timber for the mines and with the supplies the with fuel and rough in fruitful seasons the nut crop is perhaps gi than the wheat crop which so much influence throughout the food of the world when the crop is ripe the indians make ready the long beating poles bags baskets and are collected the women out at service among the washing or at the family huts the men leave their work old and young all are mounted on and start in great glee to the nut lands forming curiously picturesque flaming and skirts stream loosely over the two usually of each with baby in baskets on their backs or balanced on the the mountains of saddle bow while nut baskets and water project from each side and the long beating poles make angles in every direction ai at some well known central point where gi ass and water are found the with baskets the men with poles ascend the to the laden trees followed by the children then the beating begins right men the fly in every direction rolling down the slopes lodging here and there against rocks and sage bushes chased and gathered by the women and children with fine al gladness speedily mark the joyful scene of their labors as the fires are kindled and at night assembled in gay circles as they begin the first nut feast of the season the nuts are about half an inch long and a quarter of an inch in pointed at the top round at the base light brown in general color and like many other pine seeds handsomely dotted with purple like birds eggs the shells are thin and may be crushed between the thumb and finger the are white becoming brown by and are sweet to every being eaten by birds dogs horses and men perhaps less than one in a thousand of the whole crop is ever gathered 
62,still besides supplying their own wants in times of plenty the indians bring large quantities to market then they are eaten around nearly every fireside in the state and are even fed to horses occasionally instead of of other trees growing on the but forming a very small part of the general forest we may briefly notice the following the forests is a magnificent tree in the coast but small in the it is found only well to the northward along the banks of cool streams on the upper toward mount only a few trees of this species as far as i have seen have as yet gained a place in the a woods it has evidently been derived from the coast range by way of the of connecting mountains at the head of the valley in shady and on cool stream banks of the northern we also find the the interesting tree is distributed along the western flank of the range at an elevation of about feet mostly in and it is a small glossy like a from twenty to fifty feet high and one to two feet in the fruit a green and contains one seed about the size of an and like a hence the common name the wood is fine and of a beautiful yellow color like box sweet scented when dry though the green leaves a disagreeable the only is a small slender tree to the eastern of the range along stream sides below the pine belt especially in s valley and s make beautiful over swift cool streams at an elevation of from to feet mixed more or less with and and the mountains of above these in lake the forms fine ornamental groves and lets its light shine in the autumn months the chestnut oak seems to have come from the coast range around the head of the valley like the but as it extends southward along the lower edge of the main pine belt it grows smaller until it finally to a mere bush in the coast mountains it is a fine tall rather slender tree about from sixty to seventy five feet high growing with the grand or but unfortunately it is too good to live and is now being rapidly destroyed for besides the common oak and the grand of the foot hills and several small ones tliat make dense of al there are two mountain oaks that gi ow with the pines up to an elevation of about feet above the sea and gi the beauty of the these are tlie mountain live oak and the oak named in honor of the admirable of s oak is a firm bright beautiful tree reaching a height of sixty feet four to seven feet in with branches and gi owing at an elevation of from to feet in sunny valleys and among the and higher in a state in the cliff bound about feet above the sea it is so abundant and effective it might fairly be called the oak the leaves make beautiful the forests masses of purple in the spring and yellow in ripe autumn while its are eagerly gathered by indians and the mountain live oak q is a tough rugged of a tree growing bravely and noble dimensions on the earthquake in deep and valleys the trunk is usually short dividing near the ground into great wide spreading limbs and these again into a multitude of slender many of them cord like and drooping to the gi like those of the great white oak of the q the top of the tree where there is plenty of space is broad and with a dense covering of shining leaves making delightful the complicated system of gray branches as seen from beneath being exceedingly rich and picturesque no other tree that i know so regularly and completely as this under changes of climate due to changes in elevation at the foot of a feet above the sea you may find magnificent specimens of this oak fifty feet high with trunks five to seven feet in and at the head of the feet higher a dense soft low growth of the same species while all the way up the between these extremes of size and habit a perfect may be traced the largest i have seen was fifty feet high eight feet in and about seventy five feet in spread the trunk was all knots and gray like gi and about as and irregular as the on which it was growing â a type of steadfast strength chapter ix the the is by far the most interesting and influential of the surpassing eveiy other species in force of character numbers and extent of range and in the amount of influence he brings to bear upon the health and distribution of the vast forests he go where you will throughout the noble woods of the among the giant pines and of the lower up through the towering silver to the storm bent of the summit peaks you everywhere find this little the master existence though only a few inches long so intense is his fiery vigor and restlessness he every gi with wild life and makes himself more important than even the huge bears that through the tangled beneath him every wind is fretted by his voice almost every and branch feels the sting of his sharp feet how much the growth of the trees is stimulated by this means it is not easy to learn but his action in their seeds is more nature has made him master and committed most of her crops to his the probably over fifty per cent of all the on the are cut off and handled by the alone and of those of the big trees perhaps ninety per cent pass through his hands the greater portion is of se stored away for food to last during the winter and spring but some of 
62,them are tucked separately into loosely covered holes where some of the seeds and become trees but the is only one of the many provinces over which he holds sway for his dominion extends over all the belt of the coast mountains and far northward throughout the majestic forests of washington and british i make haste to mention these facts to show upon how substantial a foundation the importance i to him rests the is closely to the red or of the eastern woods ours may be a of this species distributed westward to the pacific by way of the great lakes and the rocky mountains and thence southward along our this view is suggested by the fact that our species becomes and more like in general the farther it is traced back along the course indicated above but whatever their relationship and the forces that have acted upon them the is now the larger and more beautiful animal from the nose to the root of the tail he measures about eight inches and his tail which he so uses in his feelings is about six inches in length he wears dark gray over the back and half way down the sides bright the mountains of on the belly with a of dark gray black separating the upper and under colors this dividing however is not very sharply defined he has long black whiskers which gives him a rather fierce look when observed closely strong claws sharp as fish hooks and the brightest of bright eyes full of telling speculation a king s river indian told me that they call him which rapidly pronounced with the first syllable heavily is not unlike the exclamation he on his way up a tree when excited most in call him the pine and when i asked an old whether he knew our little he replied with brightening countenance oh yes of course i know him everybody knows him when i m in the woods i often find out where the deer are by his at em i call em because they re so mighty quick and all the true are more or less in speech and movements but the is so possessing as he does every attribute peculiarly concentrated he is the of flashing from branch to branch of his favorite crisp and glossy and as a give him wings and he would any d in the woods his big gi ay cousin is a animal seemingly light enough to float on the wind yet when leaping from limb to limb or out of one to another he sometimes to gather strength as if making efforts concerning the up the shot of which he does not always feel exactly confident but the with his body leaps and in hidden strength seemingly as independent of common muscles as a mountain stream he threads the branches of the pines their needles like a rustling breeze now shooting across in an lines now in curves from side to side in sudden and in giddy and around the trunks getting into what seem to be the most impossible situations without sense of danger now on his now on his head yet ever graceful and his most irrepressible of energy with little and of perfect repose he is without exception the wildest animal i ever saw â a fiery little bolt of life in quick and the woods best one can hardly think of such a e being dependent like the rest of us on climate and food but after all it requires no long acquaintance to learn he is human for he works for a living his time is in the indian summer then he and like a farmer working every day for hours saying not a word cutting off the ripe at the top of his speed as if employed by the job and examining every branch in regular order as if careful that not one should escape him then descending he stores them away beneath logs and in anticipation of the hunger days of winter he seems himself a kind of fruit â both fruit and flower the of the pines every the mountains of pore of his body and eating his flesh is like one never of this bright of nature â this brave little voice crying in the wilderness â of observing his many works and ways and listening to his language his musical gossip is as to the ear as to the and though he has not exactly the gift of song some of his notes are as sweet as those of a â almost hke in softness while others and like he is the mocking bird of pouring forth mixed chatter and song like a fountain barking like a dog screaming like a hawk like a or a while in bluff audacious he is a very in descending the trunk of a tree with the intention of on the ground he preserves a cautious silence perhaps of and but while rocking safely at home in the pine tops there is no end to his and noise and woe to the gray or that to set foot on his favorite tree no matter how they trace the of the bark they are speedily discovered and kicked down stairs with comic vehemence while a torrent of angry notes comes rushing from his lips that sounds remarkably like swearing he will even attempt at times to drive away dogs and men especially if he has had no previous knowledge of them seeing a man for the first time he approaches nearer and nearer until within a few feet then with an angry outburst he makes a the i all teeth and eyes as if about to eat you up but finding that the big animal does n t scare he beats a retreat and sets himself up to on some overhanging branch every movement you make age he down the trunk again and and 
63,nervously up and down in curious you all the time as if showing off and demanding your finally growing calmer he settles down in a comfortable posture on some branch commanding a good view and beats time with his tail to a steady up up i or when somewhat less excited ah with the first syllable keenly and the second drawn out like the scream of a hawk â repeating this slowly and more emphatically at first then gradually faster until a rate of about words a minute is reached usually sitting all the time on his with resting on his breast which visibly with each word it is remarkable too that though distinctly he keeps his mouth shut most of the time and speaks h his nose i have occasionally observed him even eating seeds and a troublesome i and up a when f to the mountains of without ceasing or in any way his ah i ah i for a single moment while ascending trees all his claws come into play but in descending the weight of his body is sustained chiefly by those of the hind feet still in neither case do his movements suggest effort though if you are near enough you may see the strength of his short bear like arms and note his in the bark whether going up or down he carries his tail extended at full length in line with his body unless it be required for gestures but while running along limbs or fallen trunks it is frequently folded forward over the back with the airy tip in cool weather it keeps him warm then after he has his meal you may see him crouched close on some level limb with his tail robe neatly spread and reaching forward to his ears the electric hairs quivering in the breeze like pine needles but in wet or very cold weather he stays in his nest and while curled up there his is long enough to come forward around his nose it is seldom so cold however as to prevent his going out to his stores when hungry once as i lay storm bound on the upper edge of the timber line on mount the nearly at and the sky thick with snow a came bravely out several times from one of the lower hollows of a dwarf pine near my camp faced the wind without seeming to feel it much lightly about over the snow and dug his way down to some hidden seeds with wonder the fill precision as if to his eyes the thick were glass no other of the animals of my acquaintance is better fed not even the deer amid abundance of sweet and shrubs or the mountain sheep or bears his food consists of grass seeds nuts and the nuts and seeds of all the trees without exception â pine fir and â he is fond of them all and they all ee with him green or ripe no is too large for him to manage none so small as to be beneath his notice the smaller ones such as those of the and the and the two pine he cuts off and eats on a branch of the tree without allowing them to fall beginning at the bottom of the and cutting away the scales to expose the seeds not by guess like a bear but turning them round and round in regular order in compliance with their arrangement when thus employed his in the tree is betrayed by a of scales shells and and every few minutes by the fall of the stripped of the then of se he is ready for another and if you are watching you may catch a glimpse of him as he silently out to the end of a branch and see him examining the clusters until he finds one to his mind then leaning over pull back the needles out of his way gi the with his to prevent its falling it off in an short time seize it with jaws stretched and the of to chosen seat near the but the of the of the pine â from to twenty inches in length â and those of the variety of the yellow pine compel him to a a quite different method he cuts them off without attempting to hold them then down and them from where they have l to fall up to the bare around the of the tree where he them in the same way beginning at the bottom and following the scale to the top from a sugar pine he gets from two to four see about half the size of a so that in a few minutes he can procure enough to last a week he seems however to prefer those of the two silver first above all others perhaps because they are most easily obtained as the scales drop off when ripe without to be cut both species are filled with an exceedingly oil which all his flesh and is of itself sufficient to u count for his lightning energy you may easily know this little workman by bis on sunny around the principal trees they lie in big piles â and mat i the of them all fresh and clean making the most beautiful kitchen imaginable the brown and yellow scales and nut shells are as abundant and as delicately and tinted as the shells along the sea shore while the beautiful red and purple seed wings mingled with them would lead one to fancy that innumerable had there met their fate he on all the species long before they are ripe but is wise enough to wait until they are before he them into his this is in october and november which with him are the two months of the year all kinds of big and little are now cut off and down alike and the ground is speedily covered with 
63,them a constant and is kept up some of the larger to fall on old logs make the forest with the sound r nut less industrious know well what is going on and hasten to carry away the as they fall but however busy the may be he is not slow to the below and instantly leaves his work to drive them away the little striped is a thorn in his flesh stealing persistently punish him as he may the large gray gives trouble also although the has been accused of stealing from him generally however just the opposite is the case the excellence of the is well known to throughout the world consequently there is considerable demand for the seeds the greater portion of the supply has hitherto been procured by down the trees the mountains of in the more accessible sections of the forest alongside of bridle paths that cross the range seeds at first brought from twenty to thirty dollars per pound and therefore were eagerly sought after some of the smaller fi ul trees were cut down in the groves not protected by government especially those of and king s river most of the however are of so gigantic a size that the have to look for the greater portion of their supplies to the who soon he is no match for these he is wise enough however to cease working the instant he them and never fails to embrace every opportunity to recover his whenever they happen to be stored in any place accessible to him and the busy often finds on returning to camp that the little has spoiled the i know one seed who whenever he the wheat or beneath the trees as conscience money the want of life remarked by so many in the forests is never felt at this time of year banish all the humming insects and the birds and leaving only sir and the most of our so called would still throb with ardent life but if you should go impatiently even into the most of the groves on purpose to meet him and walk about looking up among the branches you would see very little of him but lie down at the foot of one of the trees and straightway he will come for in the midst of the ordinary forest sounds the falling of of the the screaming of the crow and the of deer and bears among the he is quick to detect your strange footsteps and will hasten to make a good close inspection of you as soon as you are still first you may hear him sounding a few notes of curious inquiry but more likely the first intimation of his approach will be the sounds of his feet as he the tree overhead just before he makes his savage to frighten you and proclaim your presence to every and bird in the neighborhood if you remain perfectly motionless he will come nearer and nearer and probably set your flesh a by across your body once while i was seated at the foot of a in one of the most inaccessible of the san engaged in a reckless fellow came up behind me passed under my arm and jumped on my paper and one warm afternoon while an old friend of mine was reading out in the shade of his cabin one of his neighbors jumped from the upon his head and then with admirable assurance ran down over his shoulder and on to the book he held in his hand our a large social circle for besides his numerous relatives t s he intimate relations with the nut eating birds particularly the crow and the numerous and the two are abundant in the and lower foot hills but more and more the mountains of distributed up through the â seldom venturing higher than six or seven thousand feet above the level of the sea the gray but little higher than this the little striped alone is associated with him everywhere in the lower and middle where they all meet they are tolerably harmonious â a happy family though very amusing may occasionally be witnessed wherever the ancient have spread forest soil there you find our hero most abundant where depth of soil and genial climate have given rise to a â in the trees but following every kind of growth up the to the highest fountains though i cannot of course expect all my readers to fully in my admiration of this little animal few i hope will think this sketch of his life too long i cannot begin to tell here how much he has cheered my lonely wanderings during all the years i have been pursuing my studies in these glorious or how much unmistakable humanity i have found in him take this for example one calm indian summer morning when the nuts were ripe i was in the upper of the south fork of the san where the seemed to be about as plentiful as the ripe they were taking an early breakfast before going to their regular harvest work while i was busy with my own breakfast i heard the fall of two or three heavy from a yellow pine near me i stole noiselessly foi ward within about twenty feet of the base of it to ob the serve in a few moments down came the the breakfast he had cut off had rolled on the gently sloping gi into a of bushes but he seemed to know exactly where they were for he found them at once apparently without searching for them they were more than twice as heavy as himself but after turning them into the right position for getting a good hold with his long teeth he managed to drag them up to the foot of the tree from which he had cut them moving backward then himself comfortably he held them on end bottom 
63,up and them at his ease a good deal of had to be done before he got anything to eat because the lower scales are barren but when he had patiently worked his way up to the fertile ones he found two sweet nuts at the base of each shaped like trimmed and spotted purple like birds eggs and notwithstanding these were dripping with soft and covered with and so strongly put together that a boy would be puzzled to cut them open with a he accomplished his meal with easy dignity and cleanliness making less effort apparently than a man would in eating soft from a plate breakfast done i whistled a tune for him before he went to work curious to see how he would be affected by it he had not seen me all this while but the instant i began to whistle he darted up the tree nearest to him and came out on a small dead limb opposite me and composed himself to listen i sang and whistled more than a dozen airs and as the music changed his eyes sparkled and the mountains of he turned his head from side to side but made no other response other hearing the strange sounds came around on all sides also and birds one of the birds a handsome seemed even more interested than the after listening for awhile on one of the lower dead of a pine he came forward within a few feet of mj face and remained fluttering in the air for half a minute or so himself with wing beats like a humming bird in front of a flower while i could look into his eyes and see his innocent wonder by this time my performance must have lasted nearly half an hour i sang or whistled o o er the water to woods o lee etc all of which seemed to be listened to with bright interest my first sitting patiently through it all with his telling eyes fixed upon me until i ventured to give the old when he screamed his name turned tail and darted with ludicrous haste up the tree out of sight his voice and actions in the case leaving a somewhat profane impression as if he had said i be hanged if you get me to hear anything so solemn and this acted as a signal for the general of the whole hairy tribe though the birds seemed willing to wait further music being naturally more in their line what there can be in that grand old church tune that is so offensive to birds and i can t the imagine a year or two after this high concert i was sitting one fine day on a hill in the coast range where the common ground were abundant they were very shy on account of being hunted so much but after i had been silent and motionless for half an hour or so they began to venture out of their holes and to feed on the seeds of the gi and around me as if i were no more to be feared than a tree stump then it occurred to me that this was a good opportunity to find out whether they also disliked old therefore i began to whistle as nearly as i could remember the same familiar airs that had pleased the of the they at once stopped eating stood erect and listened patiently until i came to old when with ludicrous haste every one of them rushed to their holes and bolted in their feet twinkling in the air for a moment as they vanished no one who makes the acquaintance of our will fail to admire him but he is far too and warlike ever to be taken for a darling how long the life of a may be i don t know the young seem to from knot holes perfect from the first and as enduring as their own trees it is difficult indeed to realize that so a piece

strength and beauty however the scope of other forest influences that of the winds is universal the snow and the upper forests every winter the lightning strikes a single tree here and there while down thousands at a as a gardener out a bed of flowers but the winds go to every tree every leaf and branch and not one is forgotten the pine towering with outstretched arms on the rugged of the icy peaks the and most retiring tenant of the they seek and find them all caressing them tenderly bending them in exercise their growth off a leaf or limb as required or removing an entire tree or grove

63,before a mountain gale and storm in the ever and anon some giant falling with a crash that shakes the hills it seems astonishing that any save the lowest trees could ever have found a period to establish themselves or once established that they should not the of sooner or later have been blown down bnt when the storm is over and we behold the same forests tranquil again towering fresh and in erect majesty and consider what centuries of storms have fallen upon them since they were first planted â hail to break the tender lightning to and snow winds and to crush and â while the manifest result of au this wild storm culture is the glorious perfection we behold then faith in s is established and we cease to the violence of her most destructive or of any other storm whatsoever there are two trees in the forests that are never blown down so long as they continue in sound health these are the and the dwarf pine of the summit peaks their stiff crooked roots grip the storm beaten like claws while their cord like branches bend round offering but slight holds for winds however violent the other â the needle pine pine two pine and â are never out by this agent to any destructive extent on account of their admirable and the of their growth in general the same is of the giants of the lower the sugar pine towering aloft to a height of more than feet offers a fine mark to storm winds but it is not and its long arms swing round in the blast like of green in a brook while the silver in most places keep their ranks well together a wind storm in the forests in united strength the yellow or silver pine is more frequently than any other tree on the because its leaves and branches form a larger mass in proportion to its height while in many places it is planted leaving open lanes through which storms may enter with full force because it is distributed along the lower portion of the range which was the first to be left bare on the breaking up of the ice sheet at the close of the winter the soil it is growing upon has been longer exposed to post and consequently is in a more crumbling decayed condition than the farther up the range and therefore offers a less secure for the roots while exploring the forest of i discovered the path of a strewn with thousands of pines of this species great and small had been or off by sheer force making a clean gap like that made by a snow but capable of doing this class of work are rare in the and when we have the forests from one extremity of the range to the other we are compelled to believe that they are the most beautiful on the face of the earth however we may regard the agents that have made them so there is always something deeply exciting not only in the sounds of winds in the woods which exert more or less influence over every mind but in their varied flow as manifested by the movements of the trees especially those of the by no other trees are they rendered so the mountains of and visible not even by the palms or tree to the breeze the waving of a forest of the giant is impressive and but the pines seem to me the best of winds they are mighty waving ever in tune singing and writing wind music all their long century lives little however of this noble tree waving and tree music will you see or hear in the strictly portion of the forests the whose sometimes more than equals its height is about as rigid as the rocks on which it grows the slender lash like of the dwarf pine stream out in wavering but the and are far too to wave even in the heaviest they only shake in quick short the however and the mountain pine and some of the of the two species bow in storms with considerable scope and but it is only in the lower and middle that the meeting of winds and woods is to be seen in all its one of the most beautiful and storms i ever enjoyed in the ed in december when i happened to be exploring one of the valleys of the river the sky and the ground and the trees had been thoroughly rain washed and were dry again the day was intensely e one of those bits of winter warm and and full of white sparkling sunshine of all the purest influences of the spring and at the same time en a wind storm in the forests with cue of the most wind storms conceivable instead of out as i usually do i then chanced to be stopping at the house of a friend but when the storm began to sound i lost no time in pushing out into the woods to enjoy it for on such occasions nature has always rare to show us and the danger to life and limb is hardly greater than one would experience crouching beneath a roof it was still early morning when i found myself fairly adrift delicious sunshine came pouring over the hills lighting the tops of the pines and setting free a steam of ance that contrasted strangely with the wild tones of the storm the air was with pine and bright green that went flashing past in the sunlight like birds pursued but there was not the slightest nothing less pure than leaves and ripe and of and moss i heard trees falling for hours at the rate of one every two or three minutes some partly on account of the loose water soaked condition of the ground others broken straight across where some weakness caused 
64,by fire had determined the spot the gestures of the various trees made a delightful study young sugar pines light and as tails were bowing almost to the ground while the grand old whose massive had been tried in a hundred storms waved solemnly above them their long branches streaming on the gale and eveiy needle thrilling and ringing and shedding oflf keen of light like a the mountains of mon l the with long drawn out in level and needles in a gray glow presented a most striking appearance as they stood in bold relief along the the in the with their red bark and large glossy leaves every way reflected the sunshine in throbbing like those one so often sees on the surface of a lake but the silver pines were now the most beautiful of all colossal feet in height waved like and bowing low as if in worship while the whole mass of their long tremulous foliage was kindled into one continuous blaze of white sun fire the force of the gale was such that the most steadfast monarch of them all rocked down to its roots with a motion plainly perceptible v hen one leaned against it e was holding high festival and every of the most rigid giants thrilled with glad excitement i drifted on through the midst of this passionate music and motion across many a from ridge to ridge often halting in the lee of a rock for shelter or to gaze and listen even when the gi and had swelled to its highest pitch i could distinctly hear the varying tones of individual trees â and fir and pine and oak â and even the infinitely gentle rustle of the withered at my feet each was expressing itself in its own way â singing its own song and making its own peculiar gestures â a richness of variety to be found in no other forest i have yet seen the woods of canada a wind storm in the forests and the and are made up of trees that resemble one another about as nearly as blades of grass and grow close together in much the same way trees in general seldom possess individual character such as is manifest among oaks and elms but the forests are made up of a greater number of distinct species than any other in the world and in them we find not only a marked into special gi but also a marked individuality in almost every tree giving rise to storm effects glorious toward midday after a long scramble through of and i gained the summit of the highest ridge in the neighborhood and then it to me that it would be a fine thing to climb one of the trees to obtain a wider outlook and get my ear close to the music of its needles but under the the choice of a tree was a serious matter one whose was not very strong seemed in danger of being blown down or of being struck by others in case they should fall another was to a considerable height above the ground and at the same time too large to be gi with and legs in climbing while others were not situated for clear views after cautiously casting about i made choice of the of a group of that were growing close together like a of grass no one of which seemed likely to fall unless all the rest fell with it though comparatively yoimg they were about feet high and their the mountains of tops were rocking and in wild ecstasy being accustomed to climb trees in making studies i experienced no difficulty in reaching the top of this one and never before did i enjoy so noble an of motion the slender tops fairly and in the passionate bending and backward and forward round and round tracing indescribable of and curves while i clung with muscles like a on a reed in its sweeps my tree top described an arc of from twenty to thirty but i felt sure of its elastic temper having seen others of the same species still more severely tried â bent almost to the gi indeed in heavy â without breaking a i was therefore safe and free to take the wind into my and enjoy the excited forest from my superb outlook the view from here must be extremely beautiful in any weather now my eye over the hills and as over fields of waving grain and felt the in and broad swelling across the valleys from ridge to ridge as the shining foliage was stirred by corresponding waves of air these waves of reflected light would break up suddenly into a kind of beaten foam and again after chasing one another in regular order they would seem to bend foi ward in curves and disappear on some like sea waves on a shore the quantity of light reflected from the bent needles was so great as to make whole groves appear as it a wind in the covered with â now while the black shadows beneath the trees greatly the effect of the silvery splendor excepting only the shadows there was nothing in all this wild sea of pines on the contrary notwithstanding this was the winter season the colors were remarkably beautiful the shafts of the pine and were brown and purple and most of the foliage was well tinged with yellow the laurel gi with the pale of their leaves turned upward made masses of gray and then there was many a dash of color from of and jet of vivid crimson from the bark of the while the gi on the appearing here and there through between the groves displayed masses of pale purple and brown the sounds of the storm with tliis wild of light and motion the profound bass of the naked branches and like the quick tense of the pine needles 
64,now rising to a shrill whistling hiss now falling to a murmur the rustling of laurel groves in the and the keen click of leaf on leaf â all this was heard in easy analysis when the attention was calmly bent the varied gestures of the multitude were seen to fine advantage so that one could recognize the different species at a distance of several miles by this means alone as well as by their forms and colors and the way they reflected the light all seemed strong and comfortable as if really enjoy the mountains of ing the storm while to its most enthusiastic greetings we hear much nowadays concerning the universal struggle for existence but no struggle in the common meaning of the word was manifest here no recognition of danger by any tree no but rather an invincible gladness as remote from exultation as from fear i kept my lofty perch for hours frequently closing my eyes to enjoy the music by or to feast quietly on the delicious fragrance that was streaming past the fragrance of the woods was less marked than that produced during warm rain when so many and leaves are like t a but from the of branches against each other and the incessant of of needles the gale was to a very ee and besides the fragrance from these local sources there were traces of brought from afar for this wind came first from the sea rubbing against its fresh waves then through the rich and spreading itself in broad currents over many a flower ridge of the coast mountains then across the golden plains up the purple foot hills and into these woods with the varied incense gathered by the way winds are of all they touch however much or little we may be able to read them their wanderings even by their alone detect the perfume of land winds far at sea and sea winds carry the fragrance of and far inland where it is a wind storm in the forests quickly recognized though mingled with the of a thousand land flowers as an illustration of this i may tell here that i breathed sea air on the of forth in scotland while a boy then was taken to where i remained nineteen years then without in all this time having breathed one breath of the sea i walked quietly alone from the middle of the valley to the gulf of on a excursion and while in far from the coast my attention wholly bent on the splendid tropical vegetation about me i suddenly recognized a as it came through the and blooming which at once awakened and free a thousand associations and made me a boy again in scotland as if all the intervening years had been most people like to look at mountain rivers and bear them in mind but few care to look at the winds though far more beautiful and sublime and though they become at times about as visible as water when the north winds in winter are making upward sweeps over the of the high the fact is sometimes published with flying snow a mile long those portions of the winds thus embodied can scarce be wholly invisible even to the darkest imagination and when we look around over an agitated forest we may see something of the wind that it by its effects upon the trees yonder it in a rush of water like and sweeps over the bending pines from hill to hill nearer we see detached and leaves now by on the mountains of level currents now whirling in or escaping over the edges of the soaring aloft on grand of air or tossing on flame like smooth deep currents falls and sing around every tree and leaf and over all the varied of the region with telling changes of form like mountain rivers to the features of their channels after tracing the streams from their fountains to the plains marking where they bloom white in falls glide in crystal gray and foam filled in choked and slip through the woods in long tranquil reaches â after thus learning their language and forms in detail we may at length hear them all together in one grand and comprehend them all in clear inner vision covering the range like lace but even this spectacle is far less sublime and not a whit more substantial than what we may behold of these storm streams of air in the mountain woods we all travel the way together trees and men but it never occurred to me until this while swinging in the wind that trees are in the ordinary sense they make many journeys not extensive ones it is ti ue but our own little journeys away and back again are only little more than tree â many of them not so much when the storm began to i dismounted and sauntered down through the woods the storm tones died away and turning toward the east i beheld the countless hosts of the forests hushed and tranquil towering above one another a wind storm in the f ee ts on the slopes of the hills like a devout audience the setting sun them with light and seemed to say while they listened my peace i give unto you as i gazed on the impressive scene all the ruin of the storm was forgotten and never before did these noble woods appear so fresh so joyous so immortal chapter xi the river floods the rivers are every spring by the melting of the snow as regularly as the famous old they begin to rise in may and in june high r mark is reached but because the melting does not go on rapidly over all the fountains high and low simultaneously and the melted snow is not at this time of year by rain the spring floods are seldom very violent or destructive the thousand 
64,falls however and the in the are then in full bloom and sing songs from one end of the range to the other of course the snow on the lower of the rivers is first melted then that on the higher fountains most exposed to sunshine and about a month later the cooler shadowy fountains send down their treasures thus allowing the main trunk streams nearly six weeks to get their waters hurried through tlie foot hills and across the to the sea therefore very violent spring floods are avoided and will be as long as the forests last the rivers of the north half of the range are still less subject to sudden floods because their upper fountains in great part lie protected from the changes of the floods the weather beneath thick folds of just as many of the rivers of lie beneath folds of ice coming to the light farther down the range in large springs while those of the high lie on the surface of solid gi exposed to every change of temperature more than ninety per cent of the water derived from the snow and ice of mount is at once absorbed and drained away beneath the folds of the mountain where and groping in the dark they at length find larger and like from which they and cool in the f of large springs some of them so large tliey give birth to rivers that set out on their journeys beneath the sun without any visible period of childhood thus the issues from a large lake like spring in valley and about two thirds of the volume of the river forth suddenly from the face of a bluff in a roaring spring seventy five yards wide these spring rivers of the north are of course shorter than those of the south whose extend up to the tops of the mountains fall river an important of the or upper is only about ten miles long and is all falls and springs from its head to its with the springs issue from the rocks at one end of it a snowy fall a hundred and eighty feet high at the other and a rush of crystal sing and dance between of course such streams are but little affected by the weather sheltered the mountains of from their flow is nearly as full in the autumn as in the time of general spring floods while those of the high to less than the part of their prime in autumn to a series of silent pools among the rocks and of their channels connected by feeble creeping threads of water like the sentences of a tired writer connected by a of and strange to say the greatest floods occur in winter when one would suppose all the wild waters would be muffled and chained in frost and snow the same long all day storms of the so called rainy season in that give rain to the give dry frosty snow to the mountains but at rare intervals warm rains and winds the mountains and push back the snow line from feet to or even higher and then come the big floods i was usually driven down out of the high about the end of november but the winter of and was so warm and calm that i was tempted to seek general views of the and of the basin of feather river in january and i had just completed a hasty survey of the region and made my way down to winter quarters when one of the flood storms that i ever saw broke on the mountains i was then in the edge of the main forest belt at a small foot hill town called on the divide between the w of the feather and rivers the cause of this notable flood was simply a sudden and fall of warm wind and rain on the the floods of these rivers at a time when they contained a considerable quantity of snow the rain was so heavy and long sustained that it was of itself sufficient to make a good wild flood while the snow which the warm wind and rain melted on the upper and middle regions of the was sufficient to make another flood equal to that of the rain now these two distinct hai of flood waters were gathered simultaneously and poured out on the plain in one magnificent the of the and feather like many others of the are admirably adapted to the growth of floods of this kind their many far and wide extensive and the are inclined while the trunks are comparatively level the flood storm was hi progress the at ranged between and and when warm wind and warm rain fall simultaneously on snow contained in like these both the rain and that portion of the snow which the rain and wind melt are at first up and held back until the combined mass becomes which at length suddenly slips and all together to the trunk channel and since the deeper the stream the faster it flows the portion of the current above the slower foot hill portion below it and all sweeping forward together with a high front on the open plain with a violence and suddenness that at first seem wholly unaccountable the of the lower portion of this particular flood was somewhat by the mountains of gravel in the river channels and by which gave way after having at first restrained and held back the waters these conditions did not however greatly influence the general result the main effect having been caused by the rare combination of flood indicate above it is a pity that but few people meet and enjoy storms so noble as this in their homes in the mountains for spending themselves in the open of the plains they are likely to be remembered more by the bridges and houses they carry away than by their 
64,beauty or the thousand blessings they bring to the fields and gardens of nature on the morning of the flood january th all the feather and were covered with running water muddy torrents filled every and and the sky was thick with rain the pines had long been sleeping in sunshine they were now awake roaring and waving with the beating storm and the winds sweeping along the curves of hill and streaming through the woods and on the tops of rocky made the wildest of wild storm melody it was easy to see that only a small part of the rain reached the ground in the of drops most of it was into dusty spray like that into which small are divided when they dash on rocks never have i seen water coming from the sky in or more passionate streams the wind chased the spray forward in choking and compelled me again and again to seek shelter in the and back of large trees to rest and catch my breath wherever i the floods went on or in hollows enthusiastic water still flashed and about my ankles recalling a wild a flood in when a hundred came and together and filled the grand valley with a sea like roar after drifting an hour or two in the lower woods i set out for the summit of a hill feet high with a view to getting as near the heart of the storm as possible in order to reach it i had to cross dry creek a of the that goes crawling along the base of the hill on the it was now a river as large as the at ordinary stages its current brown with washed down from many a claim and with boxes fence rails and logs that had long lain above its reach a slim foot bridge stretched across it now scarcely above the swollen current here i was glad to linger gazing and listening while the storm was in its richest mood â the gi ay rain flood above the brown river flood beneath the language of the river was scarcely less than that of the wind and rain the sublime of the main current the and of the the keen dash and clash of heavy waves breaking against rocks and the smooth hush of shallow currents feeling their way through the willow of the margin and amid all this varied throng of sounds i heard the smothered and of on the bottom as they were and rolling forward against one another in a wild rush after having lain still for probably years or more the mountains of the glad creek rose high above its banks and wandered from ite channel ont over many a sand flat and meadow and were bearing up against the current with nervous trembling gestures as if afraid of being carried away while branches bending dipped lightly and rose again as if the wild waters in play leaving the bridge and passing on through the storm woods all the ground seemed to be moving pine of bark sou leaves and broken branches were being swept forward and many a rock fragment from exposed was now receiving its first and in the wild streams of the storm on they rushed through eveiy and hollow leaping gliding working with a will and rejoicing like living creatures nor was the flood confined to the ground every tree had a water system of its own spreading far and wide like miniature and toward midday cloud wind and rain reached their highest development the storm was in full bloom and formed from my commanding outlook on the one of the most glorious views i ever as far as the eye could reach above around wind driven rain filled the air like one vast detached clouds swept up the valley as if they were endowed with independent motion and had special work to do in the mountain wells now rising above the pine tops now descending into their midst their and soothing every branch and leaf with gentleness in the midst of all the river floods the savage sound and motion others keeping near the ground glided behind separate groves and brought them forward into relief with admirable distinctness or passing in front whole gi in succession pine after pine melting in their gray and bursting forth again seemingly clearer than before the forms of storms are in great part measured and controlled by the of the regions where they rise and over which they pass when therefore we attempt to study them from the valleys or from and of the forest we are confounded by a multitude of separate and apparently impressions the bottom of the storm is broken up into innumerable waves and currents that against the like sea waves against a shore and these on the surface of the storm immense hollows and and sweep forward the in long trains like the of but as we ascend these partial effects disappear and the phenomena are beheld united and harmonious the longer i gazed into the storm the more plainly visible it the drifting cloud gave it a kind of visible body which explained many phenomena and published its movements in plain terms while the texture of the mass of rain rounded it out and rendered it more complete because differ in size they fall at different and overtake and clash against one another producing mist and spray they also of course yield unequal the mountains of compliance to the force of the wind which gives rise to a still greater degree of interference and passionate sweep off clouds of spray from the groves like that torn from wave tops in a gale all these of in color and texture of the general rain mass tend to make it the more and telling it is then seen as one grand flood rushing over bank and bending the pines like weeds cm this way and 
65,that whirling in huge in hollows and while the main current over all like ocean currents over the that lie hidden at the bottom of the sea i watched the gestures of the pines while the storm was at its height and it was easy to see that they were not distressed several large sugar pines stood near the thicket in which i was sheltered bowing solemnly and tossing their long arms as if the very words of the storm while accepting its wildest with passionate the lions were feeding those who have observed on sunshine during the golden days of indian summer know that none of their gestures express their celestial food is too heartily given too heartily taken to leave room for thanks the pines were evidently accepting the of the in the same whole manner and when i looked down among the and still lower to the young and on the rocks i noticed the same di methods of giving and taking and the same exquisite of what seems an outbreak of violent and the river floods force to the purposes of beautiful and delicate life like sleep come upon just as they do on people and trees and storms awaken them in the same way in the dry of the lower portion of the range the withered hills and valleys seem to lie as empty and as dead shells on a shore even the highest mountains may be found occasionally and as if in some way they had lost countenance and shrunk to less than half their real stature but when the crash and echo in the and the clouds come down and crowning their bald snowy heads every feature beams with expression and they rise again in all their imposing majesty storms are fine and tell all they know but their voices of lightning torrent and rushing wind are much less numerous than the nameless still small voices too low for human ears and because we are poor we fail to catch much that is fairly within reach our best rains are heard mostly on roofs and winds in chimneys and when by choice or we are pushed into the heart of a storm the confusion made by and nervous haste and mean fear prevent our hearing any other than the expressions yet we may di aw enjoyment from storm sounds that are beyond hearing and storm movements we cannot see the sublime whirl of around their is as silent as in the dark among the roots of plants in this great storm as in every other there were tones and gestures the mountains of gentle manifested in the midst of what is called violence and fury but easily recognized by all who look and listen for them the rain brought out the colors of the woods with delightful freshness the rich brown of the bark of the trees and the fallen and leaves and dead the of rocks and the light purple of swelling and the warm yellow of the and the air was steaming with delightful fragrance not rising and past in separate masses but diffused through all the atmosphere pine woods are always fragrant but most so in spring when the young are opening and in warm weather when the various and are softened by the sun the wind was now their innumerable needles and the rain was them grows in large beds in the and there is plenty of laurel in and on the and the rosy fragrant carpets the gi almost everywhere these with the and of the woods form the main local fragrance fountains of the storm the ascending clouds of wind rolled and rain washed became e like light and with the wind as part of it toward the middle of the afternoon the main flood cloud lifted along its western border revealing a beautiful section of the valley some twenty or thirty miles away brilliantly sun lighted and with rain sheets as if paved with silver soon afterward a jagged bluff like cloud with a sheer face appeared over the valley of the dark colored and with numerous the river floods like some huge table the blue coast range was seen stretching along the sky like a wall and the rose out of the plain like islands out of the sea then the rain began to and i sauntered down through the dripping bushes in the universal vigor and freshness that inspired all the life about me how clean and and immortal the woods seemed to be â the lofty in full bloom laden with golden and their washed shining the i rocking gently and settling back into rest and the evening on the broad leaves of the their of yellow boughs relieved against dusky of chestnut oak were in glorious revival and every moss that had ever lived seemed to be coming crowding back from the dead to clothe each trunk and stone in living green the steaming ground seemed fairly to throb and with life and young were pushing up as if already conscious of the summer glory and innumerable green and yellow were peeping and smiling everywhere as for the birds and not a wing or tail of them was to be seen while the storm was blowing dislike wet weather more than cats do therefore they were at home rocking in their dry nests the birds were hiding in the out of the wind some of the strongest of them at and but most were perched on low twigs their breast feathers the mountains of out and keeping one another company through the hard time as best they could when i arrived at the village about the good people themselves pitying my condition as if i were some snatched from the sea while i in turn warm with excitement and like the ground pitied them for being dry and of all the glory that nature had spread round about them that day chapter 
65,xii thunder storms the weather of spring and summer in the middle region of the is usually well with rains and of snow most of which are far too obviously joyful and life giving to be regarded as storms and in the picturesque beauty and clearness of outlines of their clouds they offer striking to those boundless cloud of the storms of winter the smallest and most perfectly specimens present a richly cloud rising above the dark woods about a m swelling with a visible motion straight up into the calm sunny sky to a height of to feet above the sea its white relieved by gi ay and pale purple shadows in the hollows and showing outlines as keenly defined as those of the polished in less than an hour it full development and stands poised in the blazing sunshine like some colossal mountain as beautiful in form and finish as if it were to become a permanent addition to the landscape presently a through the crisp air ringing like steel on steel sharp and clear its startling breaking into a spray of echoes against n the mountains of the cliffs and walls then down comes a of rain the big drops through the pine needles and on the and pour down the sides of and in a of gray in a few minutes the cloud to a of dim and leaving the sky perfectly clear and bright eveiy dust wiped and washed out of it everything is refreshed and a steam of fragrance rises and the storm is finished â one cloud one lightning stroke and one dash of rain this is the thunder storm reduced to its lowest terms but some of them attain much larger proportions and assume a grandeur and energy of expression hardly surpassed by those bred in the depths of winter producing those sudden floods called cloud bursts which are local and to a considerable extent for they appear nearly every day about the same time for weeks usually about eleven o clock and lasting from five minutes to an hour or two one soon becomes so accustomed to see them that the noon sky seems empty and abandoned without them as if nature were forgetting something when the glorious pearl and clouds of these storms are being built i never give attention to anything else no mountain or mountain range however clothed with light has a more enduring charm than those fleeting mountains of the sky â floating fountains bearing water for every well the angels of the streams and lakes brooding in the deep or sweeping softly along the gi over ridge and storms dome over meadow over forest over garden and grove lingering with shadows refreshing every flower and soothing rugged rock brows with a gentleness of touch and e wholly divine the most beautiful and imposing of the summer storms rise just above the upper edge of the silver fir and all are so beautiful that it is not easy to choose any one for particular description the one that i remember best fell on the mountains near valley july while i was in the silver fir woods a range of took possession of the sky huge and peaks rising one beyond another with deep between them bending this way and that in long curves and reaches interrupted here and there with white masses that looked like the spray of of lightning followed each other in quick succession and the thunder was so loud and massive it seemed as if surely an entire mountain was being shattered at every stroke only the trees were touched however so far as i could see â a few s feet high perhaps and five to six feet in were split into long rails and from top to bottom and scattered to all points of the compass then came the rain in a hearty flood covering the ground and making it shine with a continuous sheet of water that like a transparent or skin fitted closely down over all the rugged of the landscape it is not long speaking since the first f on the present of the a and in the few of thousands of years the mountains of of stormy cultivation they have been with how beautiful they have become i the first rains fell on raw crumbling and rocks without a plant now scarcely a drop can fail to find a beautiful mark on the tops of the peaks on the smooth on the curves of the on full of on the thousand forms of with their tender beauty of vegetation some falling softly on meadows creeping out of sight seeking and finding every thirsty some through the of the woods in dust through the needles and whispering good cheer to each of them some falling with blunt tapping on the broad leaves of some falling straight into fragrant kissing the lips of lilies on the sides of on shining of gold some falling into the fountains of snow to swell their well saved stores some into the lakes and rivers patting the smooth making and bells and spray washing the mountain windows washing the wandering winds some into the heart of snowy falls and as if eager to join in the dance and the song and beat the foam yet finer good work and happy work for the merry mountain each one of them a brave fall in itself rushing from the cliffs and hollows of the clouds into the cliffs and hollows of the mountains away from the thunder of the sky into the thunder of the rivers and how far they have to go and how many cups thunder storms to fill â cups holding half a drop and lake between the hills each with equal care every drop god s messenger sent on its way with glorious pomp and display of power â new born stars with lake and river mountain and valley â all that

so must he in heat or cold calm or storm ever his voice in sure accord low in the of summer and the of winter but never silent during the golden days of indian after most of the snow has been melted and the mountain streams have become feeble â a succession of silent pools linked together by shallow transparent rents and of silvery â then the song of the is at its lowest ebb but as soon as the winter clouds have and the mountain are once more with snow the voices of the streams and increase in strength and richness the flood season of early summer then the torrents chant their noblest and then is the flood time of our s melody as for weather dark days and sun days are the same to him the voices of most song birds however joyous suffer a long winter but the sings on through all the seasons and every kind of storm indeed no storm the can be more violent than those of the in the midst of which he delights to dwell however dark and boisterous the weather blowing or cloudy all the same he sings and with never a note of sadness no need of spring sunshine to his song for it never never shall you hear anything wintry from his warm breast no pinched no wavering notes between sorrow and joy his mellow voice is ever to downright gladness as free from as cock it is pitiful to see frost pinched on cold mornings in the mountain groves shaking the snow from their feathers and about as if anxious to be cheery then hastening back to their out of the wind puffing out their breast feathers over their toes and among the leaves cold and while the snow continues to fall and there is no sign of clearing but the never calls forth a single touch of pity not because he is strong to endure but rather because he seems to live a charmed life beyond the reach of every influence that makes endurance necessary one wild winter morning when valley was swept its length from west to east by a cordial snow storm i forth to see what i might learn and enjoy a sort of gi ay like darkness filled the valley the huge walls were out of sight all ordinary sounds were smothered and even the of the falls was at times buried beneath the roar of the heavy laden blast the loose snow was already over five feet deep on the mountains op the meadows making extended walks impossible without the aid of snow shoes i found no great difficulty however in making my way to a certain ripple on the river where one of my lived he was at home busily his breakfast among the pebbles of a shallow portion of the margin apparently unaware of anything extraordinary in the weather presently he flew out to a stone against which the icy ent was beating and turning his back to the wind sang as delightfully as a lark in after spending an hour or two with my favorite i made my way across the valley and through the di if ts to learn as definitely as possible how the other birds were spending their time the l are easily found during the winter because all of them excepting the are to the sunny north side of the valley the south side being constantly by the gi eat frosty shadow of the wall and because the indian groves from their peculiar exposure are the warmest the birds there more especially in severe weather i found most of the on the lee side of the larger branches where the snow could not fall upon them while two or three of the more were making desperate efforts to reach the by clinging nervously 
65,to the under side of the snow crowned masses back downward like every now and then they would some of the loose of the snow crown which would come down on them and send them screaming back to camp the water where they would among their companions with a shiver muttering in low chatter like hungry children some of the were busy at the feet of the larger trees seeds and insects joined now and then by a robin weary of his unsuccessful attempts upon the snow covered the brave were clinging to the sides of the larger and of the camp trees making short flights from side to side of the gi now and then at the they had stored in the bark and chattering as if unable to keep still yet evidently putting in the time in a very dull way like storm bound at a country tavern the hardy nut were the open of the trunks in their usual industrious manner and uttering their quaint notes evidently less distressed than their neighbors the were of course making more noisy stir than all the other birds combined ever coming and going with loud screaming as if each had a lump of melting in his throat and taking good care to improve the favorable opportunity afforded by the storm to steal from the stores of the i also noticed one gray eagle the storm on the top of a tall pine stump just outside the main grove he was standing bolt upright with his back to the wind a of snow piled on his square shoulders a monument of passive endurance thus eveiy snow bound bird seemed more or less uncomfortable if not in positive distress the mountains op the storm was reflected in every gesture and not one cheerful note not to say song came from a single bill their endurance offering a contrast to the spontaneous irrepressible gladness of the who could no more help sweet song than a rose sweet ance he must sing though the heavens fall i remember noticing the distress of a pair of during the violent earthquake of the year when the pines of the valley with strange movements and waved their branches and rock brows came thundering down to the meadows in tremendous it did not to me in the midst of the excitement of other observations to look for the but i doubt not they were singing straight on through it all regarding the terrible rock thunder as as they do the of the what may be regarded as the separate songs of the are exceedingly difficult of description because they are so and at the same time so though i have been acquainted with my favorite ten years and during most of this time have heard him sing nearly every day i still detect notes and strains that seem new to me nearly all of his music is sweet and tender from his round breast like water over the smooth lip of a pool then breaking farther on into a sparkling foam of melodious notes which glow with subdued enthusiasm yet without expressing much of the strong ecstasy of the or the more striking strains are perfect of melody composed of a few full round mellow the water notes embroidered with delicate which fade and melt in long slender in a general way his music is that of the streams refined and the deep notes of the falls are in it the of the of margin the low whispering of level reaches and the sweet of separate di from the ends of and falling into tranquil pools the never sings in chorus with other birds nor with his kind but only with the streams and like flowers that bloom beneath the surface of the ground some of our favorite s best song blossoms never rise above the of the heavier music of the water i have often observed him singing in the midst of beaten spray his music completely buried beneath the water s roar yet i knew he was surely singing by his gestures and the movements of his bill his food as far as i have noticed consists of all kinds of water insects which in summer are chiefly procured along shallow here he about his head under water and turning over pebbles and fallen leaves with his bill seldom choosing to go into deep water where he has to use his wings in he seems to be especially fond of the of found in abundance attached to the bottom of smooth rock channels where the current is shallow when feeding in such places he up stream and often while his head is under water the swift current is upward along the glossy curves of his neck and shoulders in the form of a clear shell which fairly the mountains op him like a bell glass the shell being broken and re formed as he lifts and his head while ever and anon he out to where the too powerful current carries him off his feet then he rises on the wing and goes again in places but during the winter when the stream banks are in snow and the streams themselves are chilled nearly to the point so that the snow falling into them in stormy weather is not wholly dissolved but forms a thin blue thus rendering the cm rent â then he seeks the deeper portions of the main rivers where he may to clear water beneath the or he to some open lake or at the bottom of which he in safety thus compelled to himself to a lake ho does not plunge into it at once like a duck but always in the first place upon some rock or fallen pine along the shore then flying out thirty or forty yards more or less according to the character of the bottom he with a dainty on the surface about looks down finally 
66,makes up his mind and with a sharp stroke of his wings after feeding for two or three minutes he suddenly showers the water from his wings with one vigorous shake and rises abruptly into the air as if pushed up from beneath comes back to his perch sings a few minutes and goes out to again thus coming and going singing and at the same place for hours the is usually found singly rarely in the water excepting during â â breeding season and very rare in or i once s three thus winter g ui upon a small i loi lake d the upper a bout r the level of the s m had occurred during the night but the

is in the force of heavy tliat his strength of wing in this respect is most strikingly manifested the following may x as a fair illustration of his power of sub flight one stormy morning in winter when the river was blue and green with snow i observed one of my perched on a out in the midst of a swift rushing rapid singing cheerily as if was just to his mind and while i stood on the bank admiring him ho suddenly plunged into the current the leaving his song abruptly broken off after feeding a minute or two at the bottom and when one would suppose that he must inevitably be swept far

he never flies but with rapid like beat above the stream tracing all its even when the stream is quite small say from five to ten feet wide he seldom his flight by crossing a bend however abrupt it may be and even when disturbed by meeting some one on the bank he prefers to fly over one s head to out over the ground when therefore his flight along a crooked stream is viewed it appears most strikingly wavered â a description on the air of every curve with lightning like rapidity the curves and angles of the most torrents he traces with the same rigid fidelity down the of dropping sheer over dizzy falls amid the spray and ascending with the same and ease seldom seeking to lessen the of the by beginning to ascend before reaching the base of the fall no matter though it may be several hundred feet in height he holds straight on as if about to dash headlong into the throng of then abruptly upward and after at the top of the precipice to rest a moment proceeds to feed and sing his flight is solid and impetuous without any of wing beats â one like that of a laden bee on its way home and while thus freely from fall to fall he is frequently heard giving utterance to a long train of notes in no way connected with his song but corresponding closely with his flight in sustained vigor the were the flights of all the in the traced on a they would indicate the direction of the flow

is one of the most extraordinary pieces of bird architecture i ever 
66,saw odd and novel in design perfectly fresh and beautiful and in every way worthy of the genius of the little it is about a foot in round and in outline with a neatly arched opening near the bottom

exception of a thin the floor their presence seems accidental as they are of a species found growing with the and are probably plucked with them the site chosen for this curious mansion is usually some little rock shelf reach of the lighter of the spray of a so that its walls are kept green and gi owing at least during the time of high water no harsh lines are presented by any portion of the nest as seen in place but when removed from its shelf the back and bottom and sometimes a portion of the top is found quite sharply because it is made to to the sm face of the rock upon which and

does not seem to be taken into consideration yet not the nest is large and exposed to view it is far from being easily detected chiefly because it forward like any other moss cushion growing naturally in such situations this is more especially the case where the nest is kept fresh by being well sprinkled sometimes these romantic little huts have their beauty by rock and that the water spring up

suggest any other origin than the streams themselves and one might almost be in they come direct from the living waters like flowers from the ground at least from whatever cause it never occurred to me to look for their nests until more than a year after i had made the acquaintance of the birds themselves although i found one the veiy day on which i began the search in making my way from to the at the heads of the and rivers i in a particularly mid and romantic portion of the where in previous excursions i had never failed to enjoy the company of my who were attracted here no doubt by the safe places in the rocks and by the abundance of food and water the river for miles above and below consists of a succession of small falls from ten to sixty feet in height connected by flat like that go flashing from fall to fall free and almost over waving folds of polished granite on the south side of one of the falls that portion of the precipice which is bathed by the spray the mountains op presents a series of little shelves and caused by the development of of in the granite and by the consequent fall of masses through the action of the water now here said i of all places is the most charming spot for an s nest then carefully the fretted face of the precipice through the spray i at length noticed a moss cushion growing on the edge of a level within five or six feet of the outer folds of the fall but from the fact of its being situated where one acquainted with the lives of would fancy an s nest ought to be there was nothing in its appearance visible at first sight to distinguish it from other of rock moss situated reference to spray and it was not until i had it again and again and had removed my shoes and stockings and crept along the face of the rock within eight or ten feet of it that i could decide certainly whether it was a nest or a al gi in these moss huts three or four eggs are laid white like foam and well may the little birds from them sing water songs for they hear them all their lives and even before they are born i have often observed the young just out of the nest making their odd gestures and seeming in every way as much at home as experienced parents like young bees on their first to the flower fields no amount of familiarity with people and their ways seems to change them in the least to all appearance their behavior is just the the water same on seeing a man for the first time as when they liave seen him frequently on the lower reaches of the rivers where mills are built thej m of the and all the confusion ot d and workmen on one while a was at on the u ei bank i ed one cheerily of the flying nor does any kind of unwonted put him in bad humor or frighten him out of calm self possession in passing through a the at home the mountains of i once drove one ahead of me from rapid to rapid disturbing him times in quick succession where he could not very well fly past me on account of the of the channel most birds 
66,under similar circumstances fancy themselves pursued and become suspiciously uneasy but instead of growing nervous about it he made his usual and sang one of his most tranquil strains when observed within a few yards eyes are seen to express remarkable gentleness and intelligence but they seldom allow so near a view unless one wears clothing of about the same color as the rocks and trees and knows how to sit still on one occasion while rambling along the shore of a mountain lake where the birds at least those that season had never seen a man i sat down to rest on a large stone close to the water s edge upon which it seemed the and were in the habit of when they came to feed on that part of the shore and some of the other birds also when came down to wash or drink in a few minutes along came a and alighted on the stone beside me within reach of my hand then suddenly observing me he stooped as if about to fly on the instant but as i remained as motionless as the stone he gained confidence and looked me steadily in the face for about a minute then flew quietly to the outlet and began to sing next came a and gazed at me with much the same expression of eye as the lastly down with a came a s out of a tree probably with the intention of his noisy the water throat but instead of sitting as my other visitors had done he rushed off at once nearly tumbling heels over head into the lake in his suspicious confusion and with loud screams roused the neighborhood love for song birds with then sweet human voices appears to be more common and than love for flowers every one loves flowers to some extent at least in life s fresh morning attracted by them as instinctively as humming birds and bees even the young indians have love for the brightest of those found growing on the mountains to gather them and them as for the hair and i was glad to discover through the few indians that could be induced to talk on the subject that they have names for the wild rose and the lily and other conspicuous flowers whether available as food or otherwise most men however whether savage or civilized become toward all plants that have no other apparent use than the use of beauty but fortunately one s first instinctive love of is never wholly no matter what the influences upon our lives may be i have often been delighted to see a pure spiritual glow come into the countenances of hard business men and old when a song bird chanced to alight near them nevertheless the little of meat that out the breasts of some song birds is too often the cause of their death and in particular are brought to market in hundreds but fortunately the has no enemy so eager to eat his little body as to follow him into the the of oa tain i never knew him to be chased even bv an acquaintance of mine a sort of foot hill had a pet cat a great overgrown creature about as broad shouldered as a i the winter while the snow lay deep the sat in lonely cabin among the pines smoking his pipe and wearing the dull time away tom was his sole companion sharing his be l and sitting beside him on a stool with the same drowsy expression of eye as his master the good natured bachelor was content with his hard fare of so la bread and bacon but tom the only e iu the world acknowledging dependence on him must needs be pro with fresh meat accordingly he himself to contrive el traps and the snowy woods with his gun making sad among the few winter birds neither robin ow nor tiny h the pleasure of seeing tom eat and grow fat was his great reward one cold afternoon while hunting along the river bank lie noticed a plain little bird about in the and immediately raised liis gun but just then the confiding r began to sing and after listening to his y melody the hunter turned away saying bless your little heart i can t shoot you not for tom ev in so far north as icy i have found my glad singer when i was exploring the ii s between mount and the one cold day in november after trying the mountains of in vain to force a way through the innumerable of sum bay to the great at the head of it i was weary and baffled and sat resting in my con at last that i would have to leave this part of my work for another year then i began to plan my escape to open water before the young ice which was beginning to form should shut me in i thus lingered drifting with the in the midst of these gloomy and all the terrible desolation and gi i suddenly heard the of an s wings and looking up saw my little coming straight across the ice from the shore in a second or two he was with me flying three times round my head with a happy salute as if saying cheer up old friend you see i m here and all s well then he flew back to the shore alighted on the of a and began to nod and bow as though he were on one of his favorite in the midst of a sunny a the species is distributed all along the of the pacific coast from to and east to the rocky mountains nevertheless it is as yet comparatively little known and did not meet it was i believe the first to describe a specimen from specimens were shortly ward procured by near the sources of the 
66,river between the fifty fourth and fifty sixth and it has been collected by nearly all of the numerous exploring undertaken of late through our western states and the for it never fails to engage the attention of in a very particular manner such then is our little beloved of eveiy one who is so fortunate as to know him tracing on strong wing every curve of the most torrents from one extremity of the to the other not fearing to follow them through their darkest and snow acquainted with every echoing their divine music and throughout the whole of their beautiful lives all that we in om call terrible in the of torrents and storms as only varied expressions of god s eternal love chapter xiv the wild sheep the wild sheep ranks highest among the animal of the possessed of keen sight and scent and strong limbs he dwells secure amid the leaping from to up and down the fronts of giddy crossing foaming torrents and slopes of frozen snow exposed to the wildest storms yet maintaining a brave warm life and developing from generation to generation in perfect strength and beauty nearly all the lofty mountain chains of the globe are inhabited by wild sheep most of which on account of the remote and all but inaccessible regions where they dwell are imperfectly known as yet they are by different under from five to ten distinct species or varieties the best known being the of the the the large wild sheep of central and asia or the the of the mountains of northern africa and the rocky mountain the wild sheep to this last named species belongs the wild sheep of the its range according to the late professor of the institution extends from the region of the upper and to the rocky mountains and the high gi adjacent to them on the eastern slope and as far south as the westward it extends to the coast of washington and and follows the some distance into throughout the vast region bounded on the east by the mountains and on the west by the there are more than a hundred subordinate and mountain groups north and south range beyond range with rising from eight to twelve thousand feet above the level of the sea probably all of which according to my own observations is or has been inhabited by this species compared with the which considering its size and the vast extent of its range is probably the most important of all the wild sheep our species is about the same size but the are less twisted and less the more important characteristics are however essentially the same some of the best maintaining that the two are only varied forms of one species in accordance with this view conjectures that since central asia seems to be the region where the sheep first appeared and from which it has been distributed the may have been distributed over this continent from asia by crossing strait on ice this conjecture is not so ill pacific railroad survey vol viii page the mountains of founded as at first sight would appear for the strait is only about fifty miles wide is interrupted by thi ee islands and is with ice nearly every winter the is abundant on the mountains adjacent to the strait at east cape where it is well known to the hunters and where i have seen many of their horns on account of the extreme of the sheep under culture it is generally supposed that the innumerable domestic have all been derived from the few wild species but the whole question is involved in obscurity according to sheep have been from a very ancient period the remains of a small breed from any now known having been found in the famous lake dwellings compared with the best known domestic we find that our wild species is much larger and instead of an all wool garment wears a thick overcoat of hair like that of the deer and an of fine wool the hair though rather coarse is comfortably soft and and lies smooth as if carefully tended with comb and brush the color during most of the year is gray varying to gray in the autumn the belly and a large conspicuous patch on the are white and the tail which is very short like that of a deer is black with a border the wool is white and grows in beautiful down out of sight among the shining hair like delicate climbing vines among of corn the horns of the male are of immense size the wild sheep in their greater from five to six and a half inches and from two and a half to three feet in length around the ve they are white in color and like those of the domestic ram their cross section near the base is somewhat in outline and toward the tip rising boldly from the top of the head they curve gently backward and outward then forward and outward until about three of a circle is described and until the blunt tips are about two feet or two and a half feet apart those of the female are throughout their entire length are less curved than those of the male and much smaller measuring less than a foot along the curve a ram and that i obtained near the beds to the of mount measured as follows ram ft in ft in height at shoulders around shoulders length from nose to root of tail j length of ears length of tail i j length of horns around curve distance across from tip to tip of horns j of horns at base the of a male obtained in the rocky mountains by vary but little as compared with the above the weight of his specimen was pounds which is perhaps about an and s of north america the mountains of average 
67,for full grown the females are about a third lighter besides these differences in size color hair etc as noted above we may observe that the domestic sheep in a general way is like a dull bundle of something only half alive while the wild is as elegant and graceful as a deer movement admirable strength and character the tame is timid the wild is bold the tame is always more or less ruffled and dirty while the wild is as smooth and clean as the flowers of his mountain pastures the earliest mention that i have been able to find of the wild sheep in america is by father a catholic missionary at in the year who after describing it oddly enough as a kind of deer with a sheep like head and about as large as a calf one or two years old naturally on to remark i have eaten of these beasts their flesh is very tender and delicious in his northern travels heard the species spoken of by the indians as white and and tell us that in a time of great on the head waters of the they saw plenty of wild sheep but they were too shy to be shot a few of the more energetic of the indians hunt the wild sheep every season among the more accessible sections of the high in the neighborhood of passes where from having been pursued they have become extremely wary but in the wilderness of peaks and where the foaming of the san and king s rivers take their rise they fear no hunter the wild sheep save the wolf and are more and than their tame ed while engaged in the work of exploring high regions where they delight to i have been greatly interested in studying their habits in the months of november and december and probably during a considerable portion of they all flock together male and female old and young i once found a complete band of this kind upward of fifty which on being alarmed went bounding away across a jagged bed at admirable speed led by a majestic old ram with the safe in the middle of the flock in spring and summer the full grown form separate bands of from three to twenty and are usually found feeding along the edges of meadows or resting among the castle like of the high and whether quietly feeding or the wild cliffs their noble forms and the power and beauty of their movements never fail to strike the with lively admiration their resting places seem to be chosen with reference to sunshine and a wide outlook and most of all to safety their feeding grounds are among the most beautiful of the wild gardens bright with and and of purple lying hidden away on rocky and sides where sunshine is abundant or down in the shady valleys along the banks of the streams and lakes where the sod is here they feast au summer the happy perhaps the beauty as well as the taste of the lovely on which they feed the mountains of when the winter set in their pastures with snow then like the birds they gather and go to lower usually descending the eastern flank of the range to the rough table lands and of the the wild sheep â great basin adjacent to the they never make haste however and seem to have no dread of storms many of the strongest only going down leisurely to bare wind swept to feed on bushes and dry bunch gi ass and then returning up into the snow once i was snow bound on mount for three days a little below the timber line it was a dark and stormy time well calculated to test the skill and endurance of the snow laden gale di on night and day in hissing blinding floods and when at length it began to i found that a small band of wild sheep had the storm in the lee of a of dwarf pines a few yards above my storm nest where the snow was eight or ten feet deep i was warm back of a rock with blankets bread and fire my brave companions lay in the snow without food and with only the partial shelter of the short trees yet they made no sign of suffering or faint in the months of may and june the wild sheep bring forth their young in solitary and almost inaccessible far above the rocks of the eagle i have frequently come upon the beds of the and at an elevation of from to feet above sea level these beds are simply oval shaped hollows out among loose rock and sand upon some sunny spot commanding a good outlook and partially sheltered from the winds that sweep those lofty peaks almost without such is the cradle of the httle aloft in the very sky rocked in storms in clouds sleeping in thin icy air but wrapped in his hairy coat and nourished the mountains of by a strong warm mother defended from the of the eagle and the teeth of the sly the lamb grows he soon to the rock and leaves of the white his horns begin to shoot and before summer is done he is strong and and goes forth with the flock watched by the same divine love that the more helpless human lamb in its cradle by the fireside nothing is more commonly remarked by noisy dusty trail in the a than the want of animal life â no song birds no deer no no game of any kind they say but if such could only go away quietly into the wilderness and alone with natural deliberation they would soon learn that these mountain are not without inhabitants many of whom confiding and gentle would not try to their acquaintance in the fall of i was tracing the south fork of the 
67,san up its wild to its farthest fountains it was the season of indian summer the sun beamed lovingly the were in the pine trees hovered about the last of the the willow and were yellow the meadows brown and the whole sunny mellow landscape glowed like a countenance in the deepest and sweetest repose on my way over the polished rocks along the river i came to an expanded portion of the about two miles long and half a mile wide which formed a level park with picturesque granite walls like those of valley down through the middle of it the wild sheep poured the beautiful river shining and in the golden light yellow gi on its banks and of brown meadow while the whole park was witli wild life some of which even the head of thk and least observing of must have seen had they been with me deer with their bounded from thicket to thicket as i advanced kept rising from the brown grass with a great of wings and on the mountains of the lower branches of the pines and allowed a near approach as if curious to see me farther on a broad shouldered showed himself coming out of a grove and crossing the river on a flood of logs halting for a moment to look back the bird like about my feet everywhere among the pine needles and grass the of the river the rattled from perch to perch and the blessed sang amid the spray of every where may lonely wanderer find a more interesting family of earth bom companions and fellow mortals t it was afternoon when i joined them and the glorious landscape began to fade in the before i awoke from their enchantment then i sought a camp ground on the river bank made a of tea and lay down to sleep on a smooth place among the yellow leaves of an grove next day i discovered yet and life following the river over huge swelling rock through a majestic and past innumerable the scenery in general became gradually and more the sugar pine and silver gave place to the and the walls became more rugged and bare and and became more abundant in the gardens and of meadow along the streams toward the middle of the afternoon i came to another valley strikingly wild and original in all its features and perhaps never before touched by human foot as regards area of level bottom land it is one of the wild sheep the very smallest of the type but its walls are sublime to a height of from to feet above the river at the head of the valley the main forks as is found to be the case id all the of this one is due chiefly to the action of two great whose fountains lay to the eastward on the of and and a cluster of nameless peaks farther south the mountains of the gray river was singing loudly through the valley but above its roar i heard the of a which drew me eagerly on and just as i emerged from the tangled groves and at the head of the valley the main fork of the river came in sight falling fresh from its fountains in a snowy between granite walls feet high the steep incline down which the glad waters thundered seemed to bar all farther progress it was not long however before i discovered a crooked in the rock by which i was enabled to climb to the edge of a terrace that crosses the and the nearly in the middle here i sat down to take breath and make some in my note book taking advantage at the same time of my elevated position above the trees to gaze back over the valley into the heart of the noble landscape little knowing the while what neighbors were near after spending a few minutes in this way i chanced to look across the fall and there stood three sheep quietly observing me never did the sudden appearance of a mountain or fall or human friend more forcibly seize and my attention anxiety to observe accurately held me perfectly still eagerly i marked the flowing of their muscles their strong legs ears eyes heads their graceful rounded necks the color of their hair and the bold curves of their noble horns when they moved i watched every gesture while they in no wise disconcerted either by my attention or by the the wild sheep tumultuous roar of the water advanced deliberately alongside the between the two divisions of the turning now and then to look at me presently they came to a steep ice which they ascended by a succession of quick short stiff legged leaps reaching the top without a struggle this was the most startling feat of i had ever witnessed and considering only the of the thing my astonishment could hardly have been greater had they displayed wings and taken to flight on such gi would have fallen and rolled like loosened many a time where the slopes are far lower i have been compelled to take off my shoes and stockings tie them to my belt and creep with the utmost caution no wonder then that i watched the ess of these animal with keen sympathy and in the boundless of wild nature displayed in their invention construction and keeping a few minutes later i caught sight of a dozen more in one band near the foot of the upper fall they were standing on the same side of the river with me only twenty five or thirty yards away looking as and perfect as if created on the spot it appeared by their tracks which i had seen in the little and by their present position that when i came up the they were all feeding together down in the valley and in their haste to reach high gi 
67,where they could look about them to ascertain the nature of the strange disturbance they were divided three ascending on one side the river the rest on the other the mountains op a the headed by an chief now began to cross the wild between the two divisions of tlie this was another the wild sheep exciting feat for among all the varied experiences of the crossing of boisterous torrents is found to be one of the most trying to the nerves yet these fine fellows walked to the brink and jumped from to holding themselves in easy above the whirling current as if they were doing nothing extraordinary in the immediate of this rare picture there was a fold of ice granite traversed by a few bold lines in which rock and of were gi owing the gray walls on the sides nobly and adorned with brown and pines lofty peaks in the distance and in the middle ground the snowy fall the voice and soul of the landscape bushes beating time to its thunder tones the brave sheep in front of it their gray forms slightly obscured in the spray yet standing out in good heavy relief against the close white water with their huge horns rising like the roots of dead pine trees while the evening streaming up the colored all the picture a rosy purple and made it glorious after crossing the river the led by their chief at once began to scale the wall turning now right now left in long single file keeping well apart out of one another s way and leaping in regular succession from to now ascending slippery dome curves now walking leisurely along the edges of stopping at times to gaze down at me from some flat rock with heads held as if curious to learn what i thought about it or whether i was likely to the mountains of follow them after reaching the top of the wall which at this place is somewhere between and feet high they were visible against the sky as they looking down in groups of or throughout the entire ascent they did not make a single awkward step or an unsuccessful effort of any kind i have frequently seen tame sheep in mountains jump upon a sloping rock surface hold on a few seconds and fall back and but in the most trying situations where the slightest want or would have been fatal these always seemed to move in comfortable reliance on their strength and skill the limits of which they never appeared to know moreover each one of the flock while following the guidance of the most experienced yet climbed with independence as a perfect individual capable of separate existence whenever it should wish or be compelled to aw from the little the domestic sheep on the is only a of an animal a whole flock being required to form an individual just as numerous are required to make one complete those who in summer drive their flocks to the mountain pastures and while watching them night and day have seen them frightened by bears and storms and scattered like will in some measure be able to appreciate the self reliance and strength and noble individuality of nature s sheep like the climbing of europe our is said to plunge headlong down the faces the sheep of sheer and alight on his big horns i know only two hunters who claim to have actually witnessed this feat i never was so fortunate they describe the act as a head foremost the horns are so large at the base that they cover the upper portion of the head down nearly to a level with the eyes and the skull is exceedingly strong i struck an old specimen on mount a dozen blows with my ice ax without breaking it such would not very readily by the wildest rock but other bones could hardly be expected to hold together in such a performance and the mechanical difficulties in the way of their movements after striking upon an irregular surface are in themselves sufficient to show this like method of to be impossible even in the absence of all other evidence on the subject moreover the follow wherever the may lead although horns are mere i have found many pairs of the horns of the old considerably battered doubtless a result of fighting i was particularly interested in the question aft r witnessing the performances of this san band upon the rocks at the foot of the falls and as soon as i procured specimens and examined their feet all the disappeared the secret considered in connection with strong muscles is simply this the wide portion of the bottom of the foot instead of wearing down and becoming flat and hard like the feet of tame sheep and horses out in a soft rubber like or cushion which not only the mountains of and holds well on smooth rocks but fits into small and down upon or against slight even the hardest portions of the edge of the are comparatively soft and elastic the toes admit of an extraordinary amount of both and movement allowing the foot to accommodate itself still more perfectly to the of rock while at the same time increasing the power at the base of sheep rock one of the winter of the flocks there lives a who has had the advantage of observing the movements of wild sheep every winter and in the course of a conversation with him on the subject of their habits he pointed to the front of a about feet high which is only eight or ten degrees out of the perpendicular there said he i followed a band of them fellows to the back of that rock yonder and expected to capture them all for i thought i had a dead thing on them i got behind them on a bench that runs along the 
67,face of the wall near the top and comes to an end where they could n t get away without falling and being killed but they jumped off and landed all right as if that were the regular thing with them what said i jumped feet perpendicular did you see them do it no he replied i did nt see them going down for i was behind them but i saw them go off over the brink and then i went below and found their tracks where they struck on the loose rubbish at the bottom they just sailed right off and the wild landed on their feet right side that is the of animal tliey is â beats anything else that goes on four legs on another sion a flock that was pursued by hunters retreated to another portion of this same cliff where it is still higher and followed they were seen jumping down in perfect order one behind another by two men who happened to be where they hail a fair view of them and could watch their progress fi om top to bottom of the precipice both and made frightful descent extraordinary concern the the of half falling wiu a pi the mountains of half leaping movements by striking at short intervals and holding back with their rubber feet upon small and until near the bottom when they sailed off into the free air and on their feet but with their bodies so nearly in a position that they appeared to be it appears therefore that the methods of this wild become clearly as soon as we make ourselves acquainted with the rocks and the kind of feet and muscles brought to bear upon them the and indians are or rather have been the most successful hunters of the wild sheep in the regions that have come under my own observation i have seen large numbers of heads and horns in the of mount and the beds where the indians had been in stormy weather also in the of the opposite s valley while the heavy arrow heads found on some of the highest peaks show that this warfare has long been going on in the more accessible that stretch across the desert regions of and considerable numbers of indians used to hunt in company like of wolves and being perfectly acquainted with the of their and with the habits and instincts of the game they were pretty successful on the tops of nearly every one of the mountains that i have visited i found small nest uke built of stones in which as i afterward learned one or more indians would he in wait while their the wild sheep the below knowing that the sheep would surely run to the summit and when they could be made to approach with the wind they wore shot at short range iu b wild still lai er bands of indians used to make extensive upon some

the mountains of the bears be regarded as enemies for though they seek to vary every day diet of nuts and by an occasional meal of mutton they prefer to hunt tame and helpless flocks and no doubt capture an lamb at times or some unfortunate beset in deep soft snow but these cases are little more than accidents so also a few perish in long continued snow storms though in all my i have not found more than five or six that seemed to have met their fate in this way a little band of three were discovered snow bound in bloody a few years ago and were killed with an ax by who chanced to be crossing the range in winter man is the most dangerous enemy of all but even from him our brave mountain has little to fear in the remote of the high the golden plains of the and san were lately thronged with bands of and but being fertile and accessible they were required for human pastures so also are many of the feeding grounds of the deer â hill valley forest and meadow â but it will be

a rough region rich in gold iron veins of dead fire rivers and dead water rivers are developed here side by side within a of a few miles and placed open before the student like a book while the people and the region beyond the camp furnish mines of study of never failing interest and variety when i discovered this place i was tracing the channels of the ancient pre rivers instructive sections of which have been laid bare here and in the adjacent regions by the according to the poets go on forever but those of the are young as yet and have scarcely learned the way down to the sea while at least one generation of them have died and vanished together with most of the they drained all that remains of them to tell their history is a series of interrupted fragments of channels mostly choked with gravel and buried beneath broad the mountains of thick sheets of 
68,these are known as the dead rivers of and the gravel deposited in them is called the blue lead in some places the channels of the present rivers in the same direction or nearly so as those of the ancient rivers but in general there is little correspondence between them the entire having been changed or rather made new many of the hills of the ancient have become hollows and the old hollows have become hills therefore the channels with their loads of gravel occur in all kinds of of places or even at right angles to the present across the tops of lofty or far beneath them presenting impressive illustrations of the magnitude of the changes accomplished since those ancient streams were the last period preceding the of the seems to have come on over all the range almost simultaneously like the period notwithstanding of different age occur together in many places indicating numerous periods of activity in the fire fountains the most important of the ancient river channels in this region is a section that extends from the south side of the town beneath creek and the ridge beyond it to the of the but on account of its depth below the general surface of the present valleys the rich gold it is known to contain cannot be easily worked on a large scale their extraordinary richness may be inferred from the in the foot hills fact that many claims were worked in them by sinking shafts to a depth of feet or more and the dirt by a should the dip of this ancient channel be such as to make the available as a then the gi and deposit might be worked by the method and although a long expensive would be required the scheme might still prove profitable for there is millions in it the importance of these ancient gi as gold fountains is well known to even the superficial of the present streams have derived much of their gold from them according to all accounts the have been very rich â terrific rich as they say here the have been cut and and every and and valley torn to pieces and expressing a fierce and desperate energy hard to understand still any kind of t making is better than and there is something sublime in seeing men working in dead earnest at anything pursuing an object with like energy and many a brave fellow has recorded a most chapter of life on these rocks but most of the are sleeping now their wild day done while the few linger languidly in the washed out or sleepy village like bees around the ruins of their hive we have no industry left now they told me and no men everybody and everything has gone to decay we are only â out of the game a thin of poor compared with what we used the mountains of to be in the grand old gold days we were giants then and you can look around here and see our tracks but although these are perhaps more exhausted than the mines and about as dead as the dead rivers they are yet a rare and interesting set of men with much gold mixed with the rough rocky gi of their characters and they manifest a breeding and intelligence little looked for in such surroundings as theirs as the heavy long continued grinding of the brought out the features of the so the intense experiences of the gold period have brought out the features of these old forming a richness and variety of character httle known as yet the sketches of and miller have not exhausted this field by any means it is interesting to note the extremes possible in one and the same character and gentleness and and fierce endeavor men who twenty years ago would not cease their to save their lives now play in the streets with children their long like waiting after the exhaustion of the has brought on an exaggerated form of i heard a group of in the street eagerly discussing the quantity of tail ed for a boy s and one undertook the sport of flying it the information that he was a boy always was a boy and d â n a man who was not a boy inside however ancient outside mines morals politics the immortality of the soul etc were discussed beneath and in the time for each being in the foot hills apparently by the temperature contact with nature and the habits of observation acquired in gold seeking had made them all to some extent and like wood rats they had gathered all kinds of odd specimens into their and now required me to examine them they were the and most interesting specimens one of them offered to show me around the old giving me fair warning before setting out that i might not like him because said he people say i m eccentric i notice everything and gather and and anything that s queer and so some don t like me and call me eccentric i m always to find out things now there s a weed the indians eat it for what do you call those long flies with big heads flies i suggested well their jaws work instead of up and down and jaws work the same way and therefore i think they are the same species i always notice everything like that and just because i do they say i m eccentric etc anxious that i should miss none of the wonders of their old gold field the good people had much to say about the beauty of cave city cave and advised me to explore it this i was very glad to do and finding a guide who knew the way to the mouth of it i set out from the next morning the most beautiful and extensive of the mountain of occur in a 
68,belt of that is pretty generally developed along the western flank of the from the mc the mountains of cloud on the north to the on the south a distance of over miles at an elevation of from to feet above the sea besides this regular belt of the are by long imposing ranks of sea rugged and in architecture carved in the coast and by centuries of wave dashing and innumerable great and small in the unequal flowing and of the sheets in which they occur fine illustrations of which are presented in the famous beds and around the base of icy in this comprehensive glance we may also notice the shallow wind n in along the of the plains and the cave like recesses in the and where bears and other find shelter during the fall of sudden storms in general however the grand massive of the as far as it has been laid bare to observation is about as solid and as a fresh beauty opens one s eyes wherever it is really seen but the very abundance and completeness of the common beauty that our steps prevents its being absorbed and appreciated it is a good thing therefore to make short excursions now and then to the bottom of the sea among and coral or up among the clouds on or in or even to creep like worms into dark holes and not only to learn something of what is going on in those out of the way places but to see better what the sun sees on our return to common every day beauty in the foot hills our way from s to the cave lay across a series of picturesque in the region between the brown foot hills and the forests a stretch of rolling hill waves breaking here and there into a kind of rocky foam on the higher and sinking into delightful hollows with vines the day was a fine specimen of pure sunshine most of the time by a single cloud as the sun rose higher the heated air began to flow in tremulous waves from every southern slope the sea breeze that usually comes up the foot hills at this season with on its wings was scarcely perceptible the birds were assembled beneath leafy shade or made short languid flights in search of food all save the majestic with broad wings he sailed the warm air un wearily from ridge to ridge seeming to enjoy the sunshine like a butterfly too whose no heat or cold may were among the pines and the innumerable hosts of the insect kingdom were throbbing and wavering as this bearing region used to be a deer and bear pasture but since the of the gold period these fine animals have almost wholly disappeared here also once the and elephant whose bones are found in the river and beneath thick folds of toward noon as we were riding slowly over bank and in the sun heat we witnessed the of a new mountain range a of clouds in land the mountains of as truly sublime and beautiful â if only we have a mind to think so and eyes to see â as the more ancient rocky beneath it with its forests and reminding us that as there is a lower world of so also there is an upper world of clouds huge developed with astonishing rapidity from mere swelling with visible motion into colossal mountains and higher higher in long massive peak beyond peak dome over dome with many a picturesque valley and shadowy cave between while the dark and pines of the upper benches of the were projected against their pearl with exquisite clearness of outline these cloud mountains vanished in the as quickly as they were developed leaving no but they were not a whit less real or interesting on this account the more enduring hills over which we rode were vanishing as surely as they only not so fast a difference which is great or small according to the from which it is contemplated at the bottom of every we found little in wild brush and vines wherever the of the hills left patches of ground these secluded are settled mostly by and who plant a few vegetables and vines at odd times while their main business is and in spite of all the natural beauty of these they can hardly be called homes they are only a better kind of camp gladly abandoned whenever the hoped for gold harvest has been gathered there is an air of profound and melancholy about m the foot hill th best of their beauty is thrust upon them by nature apart from which they are only a few logs and boards rudely and without either ceiling or floor a rough fireplace with corresponding cooking a shelf bed and stool the ground about them is strewn vith battered boxes and specimens from many a ledge indicating the nd of their owners hard lives the ride from s to the cave is scarcely two hours long but w e lingered among and banks of dead river gravel until long after noon at length emerging from a narrow a small house came in sight set in a thicket of fig trees at the base of a hill that said my guide pointing to the house is cave city and the cave is in that gray hill arriving at the one house of this one house city we were welcomed by three drunken men who had come to town to hold a the mistress of the house tried to keep order and in reply to our inquiries told us that the cave guide was then in the cave with a party of ladies and must we wait until he returns i we asked no that was we might take candles and go into the cave alone provided we shouted from time to time so as to be found 
68,by the guide and were careful not to fall over the rocks or into the dark pools accordingly taking a trail from the house we were led around the base of the hill to the mouth of the cave a small around the edges and shaped like the door of a water s nest with no hint or advertisement of â i t ii ii p i â i l i fe ir râ the mountains of dark with incessant activity the and were everywhere hung with down growing like groves of some of them large others delicately each tipped with a single drop of water like the bud of a pine tree the only sounds were the dripping and of water falling into pools or faintly on the crystal floors in some places the crystal are arranged in graceful flowing folds deeply like stiff silken in others straight lines of the ordinary forms are combined with reference to size and tone in a regularly gi system like the strings of a harp with musical tones and on these stone we played by striking the crystal strings with a stick the delicious liquid tones they gave forth seemed perfectly divine as they sweetly whispered and wavered through the majestic halls and died away in faintest â the music of fairy land here we lingered and rejoicing to find so much music in stony silence so much splendor in darkness so many in the depths of the buildings ever in process of construction yet ever finished developing from perfection to perfection profusion without eveiy visible or invisible in glorious motion marching to the music of the in a region regarded as the abode of eternal stillness and death the outer chambers of mountain are frequently selected as homes by wild beasts in the in the foot hills however they seem to prefer homes and hiding places in and beneath as i have never seen their tracks in any of the this is the more remarkable because notwithstanding the darkness and water there is nothing cellar like or about them when we emerged into the bright of the sun everything looked brighter and we felt our faith in nature s beauty strengthened and saw more clearly that beauty is universal and immortal above beneath on land and sea mountain and plain in heat and cold light and darkness chapter xvi the bee when was wild it was one sweet bee garden thi its entire length north and south and all the way across from the snowy a to the ocean wherever a bee might fly within the bounds of this virgin wilderness â through the

thousands of the acres like a fire and many species of tlie best honey plants to the bee pastures rocky cliffs and fence corners while on the other hand cultivation thus far has given no adequate compensation at least in kind only acres of for miles of the richest wild pasture ornamental roses and around cottage doors for of wild roses in the and small square and orange groves for broad of the great central plain of during the months of march april and may was one smooth continuous bed of honey bloom so rich that in walking from one end of it to the other a distance of more than miles your foot would press about a hundred flowers at every step and innumerable were so crowded together that had ninety nine per cent of them been taken away the plain would still have seemed to any but the radiant ul touching and and rising above one another glowed in the living light like a sunset sky â one sheet of purple and gold with the bright pouring through the midst of it from the north the san from the south and their many sweeping in at right angles from the mountains dividing the plain into sections fringed with trees along the rivers there is a strip of bottom land beneath the general level and wider toward the foot hills where magnificent oaks from three to eight feet in cast grateful masses of shade over the open like and close along the water s edge there was a fine the mountains of of tropical composed of wild rose and bushes and a great variety of climbing vines and the branches and trunks of and and swinging across from summit to in heavy here the wild bees in fresh bloom long after the flowers of the plain had withered and gone to seed and in when the were ripe the indians came from the mountains to feast â men women and babies in long noisy trains often joined by the of the neighborhood who gathered this wild with appreciation of its superior flavor while their home were full of ripe and and their were laden with grapes but though these ant shaggy river beds were thus distinct from the smooth plain they made no heavy dividing lines in general views the whole appeared as one continuous sheet of bloom bounded only by the mountains when i first saw this central garden the most extensive and regular of all the bee pastures of the state it seemed all one sheet of plant gold and vanishing in the distance distinct as 
68,a new map along the foot hills at my feet the eastern slopes of the coast range through beds of and and around many a and bush crowned i at length out into the of it all the ground was covered not witli gi ass and green leaves but with radiant about ankle deep next the foot hills knee deep or more five or six bee m the mountains of miles out here were gi etc growing in close social of various shades of yellow finely with the of and whose delicate were drinking the vital without giving back any sparkling glow because so long a period of extreme the rainy season most of the vegetation is composed of which spring up simultaneously and bloom together at about the same height above the ground the general surface being but slightly ruffled by the taller and groups of the king of the in any hundreds of these happy sun plants brushed against my feet at every step and closed over them as if i were in liquid gold the air was sweet with fragrance the sang their blessed songs rising on the wing as i advanced then sinking out of sight in the sod while of wild bees stirred the lower air with their monotonous hum â monotonous yet forever fresh and sweet as every day sunshine and showed themselves in considerable numbers in shallow places and small bands of were almost constantly in sight gazing curiously from some slight elevation and then bounding swiftly away with grace of motion yet i could discover no crushed flowers to mark their track nor indeed any action of any wild foot or tooth whatever the great yellow days by while i drifted toward the north observing the the bee countless of life about me lying down almost anywhere on the approach of night and what glorious beds i had on i would find several new species leaning over me and looking me full in the face so that my studies would begin before rising about the first of may i turned eastward crossing the san river between the mouths of the and and by the time i had reached the foot hills most of the vegetation had gone to seed and become as dry as hay all the seasons of the gi eat plain ai e warm or temperate and bee flowers are never wholly wanting but the grand â the annual â is governed by the rains which usually set in about the middle of november or the beginning of december then the seeds that for six months have lain on the gi dry and fresh as if they had been gathered into at once their life the general brown and purple of the ground and the dead vegetation of the preceding year give place to the green of and and of young leaves then one species after another comes into flower gradually the green with yellow and purple which lasts until may the rainy season is by no means a gloomy period of constant and rain perhaps nowhere else in north america perhaps in the world are the months of december january and march so full of bland plant building sunshine referring to my notes of the winter and spring of every day of which i spent the mountains of out of doors on that section of the plain lying between the and rivers i find that the first rain of the season fell on december th had only six rainy days â that is days on which rain fell february three march five april three and may three the so called rainy season which was about an average one the ordinary rain storm of this region is seldom very cold or violent the winds which in settled weather come from the round into the opposite direction the sky fills gradually and with one general cloud from which the rain falls steadily often for days in succession at a e of about â or more than seventy five per cent of all the rain of this season came from the down the coast over british washington and though the local winds of these circular storms blow from the one magnificent local storm from the fell on march a massive round cloud came and thundering over the plain in most imposing majesty its front burning white and in the full blaze of the sun warm rain ed from its ample fountains like a beating down flowers and bees and the as suddenly as those of are by the so called but in less than half an not a trace of the heavy mountain like cloud structure was left in the sky and the bees were on the wing as if nothing more gi refreshing could have been sent them the bee by the end of january four species of plants were in flower and five or six had already adjusted their and were in the prime of life but the flowers were not sufficiently numerous as yet to affect greatly the general green of the young leaves made their appearance in the first week of february and toward the end of this month the warmer portions of the plain were already golden with of the flowers of this was the full the sunshine gi and richer new plants every day the air became more with humming wings and sweeter with the fragrance of the opening flowers and ground were getting ready for their summer work rubbing their limbs and themselves on the piles before their doors and were busy mending their old or weaving new ones in march the vegetation was more than doubled in depth and color a large white and two were in bloom together with a host of yellow tall enough now to bend in the wind and show wavering of shade in april plant life as a whole reached its greatest height and the plain over all its 
69,varied surface was with a close of and golden by the end of this month most of the species had their seeds but still seemed to be in bloom from the numerous like and of scales of the in may the bees g the mountains of found in flower only a few deep set plants and june july august and september is the season of rest and sleep â a winter of dry heat â followed in october by a second outburst of bloom at the very time of the year then after the mass of leaves and of the dead vegetation and turn to dust beneath the foot as if it had been baked in an oven a slender little plant from six inches to three feet high suddenly makes its appearance in patches miles in extent like a of the bloom of april i have counted upward of flowers five of an inch in on a single plant both its leaves and stems are so slender as to be nearly invisible at a distance of a few yards amid so a multitude of flowers the ray and flowers are both yellow the and the texture of the rays is rich and like the of garden the wind turns all the heads round to the so that in facing we have the flowers looking us in the face in my estimation this little plant the last born of the brilliant host of that the plain is the most interesting of au it remains in flower until november with two or three species of which continue the chain around december to the spring flowers of thus although the main bloom and honey season is only about three months long the circle however thin around some of the hot months is never completely broken the bee pastures how long the various species of wild bees have lived in this honey garden nobody knows probably ever since the main body of the present gained possession of the land toward the close of the period the first brown honey bees brought to are said to have arrived in san in march a bee keeper by the name of purchased a lot consisting of twelve from some one at who had brought them from new york when landed at san all the contained live bees but they finally to one hive which was taken to san the little flourished and multiplied in the pastures of the valley sending off three the first season the owner was killed shortly afterward and in settling up his estate two of the were sold at for and other were made from time to time by way of the and though gi eat pains were taken to success about one half usually died on the way four were brought safely across the plains in the being placed in the rear end of a wagon which was stopped in the afternoon to allow the bees to fly and feed in the places that were within reach until dark when the were closed in two years after the time of the first from new york a single swarm was brought over from san and let fly in the great central plain bee culture however has never gained much attention here notwithstanding the the mountains of abundance of honey bloom and the high price of honey during the years a few are found here and there among who chanced to have learned something about the business before coming to the state but sheep cattle grain and raising are the chief as they require less skill and care while the profits thus far have been greater in honey sold here at from one and a half to two dollars per pound twelve years later the price had fallen to twelve and a half cents in i sat down to dinner with a band of sheep at a on the san where fifteen or twenty were kept and our host advised us not to spare the large pan of honey he had placed on the table as it was the article he had to offer in all my walks however i have never come upon a regular bee in the central valley like those so common and so managed in the southern of the state the few pounds of honey and wax produced are consumed at home and are scarcely taken into account among the of the farm the that escape from their careless owners have a time of it in seeking suitable homes most of them make their way to the foot hills of the mountains or to the trees that line the banks of the rivers where some hollow log or trunk may be found a friend of mine while out hunting on the san came upon an old trap hidden among some tall grass near the edge of the river upon which he sat down to rest shortly ward his attention was attracted to a crowd the bee of angry bees that were flying excitedly about his head when he discovered that he was sitting upon their hive which was found to contain more than pounds of honey out in the broad of the and san rivers the little have been known to build their in a bunch of or stiff gi ass only slightly protected from the weather and in danger every spring of being carried away by floods they have the advantage however of a vast extent of fresh pasture accessible only to themselves the present condition of the grand central garden is very different from that we have about twenty years ago when the gold had been pretty thoroughly the attention of fortune â not home â was in great part turned from the mines to the fertile plains and many began experiments in a kind of restless wild a load of lumber would be hauled to some spot on the free wilderness where water could be easily 
69,found and a rude box cabin built then a gang was procured and a dozen worth ten or fifteen dollars apiece and with these hundreds of acres were as easily as if the land had been under cultivation for years tough roots being almost wholly absent thus a was established and from these bare wooden huts as of desolation the wild vanished in ever circles but the arch are the with their flocks of sweeping over the ground like a fire and down every rod that escapes the the mountains of as completely as if the whole plain were a cottage garden plot without a fence but notwithstanding these a thousand of bees may be ed here for every one now gathering honey the greater portion is still covered every season with a repressed growth of bee flowers for most of the species are and many of them are not by sheep or cattle while the rapidity of their gi them to develop and mature their seeds before any foot has time to crush them the ground is therefore kept sweet and the race is though only as a suggestive shadow of the magnificence of its the time will undoubtedly come when the entire area of this noble valley be like a garden when the waters of the mountains now flowing to the sea will be distributed to every acre rise to prosperous towns wealth arts etc then i suppose there will be few left even among to the vanished in the mean time the pure waste going on â the wanton destruction of the â is a sad sight to see and the sun may well be pitied in being compelled to look on the bee pastures of the coast last longer and are more varied than those of the great plain on account of differences of soil and climate moisture and shade etc some of the mountains are upward of feet in height and small streams springs etc in great abundance and variety in the wooded regions while open with sunshine and valleys lying at different each with the bee pastures its own peculiar climate and exposure possess the ed conditions for the development of species and families of plants widely varied next the plain th re is first a series of smooth hills planted with a rich and vegetation that but little from that of the plain â as if the edge of the plain had been lifted and bent into flowing folds with all its flowers in place only toned down a little as to their and a few new species introduced such as the hill and the colors show finely when thus held to view on the slopes patches of red purple blue yellow and white around the edges the whole appearing at a little distance like a map colored in sections above this lies the park and region with oaks mostly planted wide

instead of lying exposed to the flocks of the wandering these remarks apply more particularly to the north half of the coast farther south there is less moisture less forest shade and the honey is less varied the mountains of the region is the largest of the three main divisions of the bee lands of the state and the most regularly varied in its owing to their gradual rise from the level of the central plain to the the foot hill region is about as dry and from the end of may until the setting in of the winter rains as the plain there are no shady forests no damp at all like those lying at the same in the coast mountains the social of the plain with a few added species form the bulk of the portion of the vegetation up to a height of feet or more shaded lightly here and there with oaks

though the snow every winter is deep even higher than this several bee trees have been cut which contained over pounds of honey the destructive action of sheep has not been so general on the mountain pastures as on those of the great plain but in many places it has been the mountains of more complete owing to the more character of the soil and its sloping position the digging and down action of

the belt and lower forests are in full bloom in june those of the upper and region in july august and september in scotland after the best of the bloom is past the bees are carried in carts to the and

find the first feet from the summit generally snow clad and therefore about as as the sea the base of this region is by a belt of crumbling measuring about feet in breadth and is mostly free from snow in summer beautiful the faces of the cliffs with their bright colors and in some of the there are a few of wall flowers and but notwithstanding the mountains of these bloom freely in the late summer the as a whole is almost as as the icy summit and its lower edge may be taken as the honey line immediately below this comes the forest covered with a rich growth of chiefly silver rich in and honey dew and with countless garden many of them less than a hundred yards across next in orderly succession comes the great bee its area far that of the icy summit and both the other combined for it goes sweeping around the entire mountain with a breadth of six or seven miles and a of nearly a hundred miles as we have already seen is a fire mountain created by a succession of of ashes and which flowing over the lips of its several grew outward and upward like the trunk of a tree then followed a strange contrast the winter came on the mountain with ice which flowed slowly outward in every direction from the summit in the form of one vast â a down crawling mantle of ice upon a fountain of fire crushing and gi for centuries its brown with incessant activity and thus and the entire mountain when at length the period began to draw near its close the ice mantle was gi melted around the bottom and in receding and breaking into its present condition irregular and heaps of matter

surrounding woods for miles to a depth of from six inches to several feet the history of this last is also preserved in the traditions of the indians they tell of a fearful time of darkness when the sky was black with ashes and smoke that threatened every living thing with death and that when at length the sun appeared once more it was red like blood less recent in great numbers the adjacent region some of them with lakes in their throats others overgrown with trees and flowers nature in these old and having given beauty for ashes on the side of mount there is a subordinate the mountains of about feet below the summit which has been active subsequent to the breaking up of the main ice cap that once covered the mountain as is shown by its comparatively and the streams of from it the main summit is about a mile and a half in bounded by small crumbling peaks and among which we seek in vain for the of the ancient these masses and the deep gi that the sides of the mountain show that it has been considerably lowered and wasted by ice how much we have no sure means of knowing just below the extreme summit hot and issue from irregular mixed with spray derived from melting snow the last feeble expression of the mighty force that built the mountain not in one great was given birth the of the summit and the sections exposed by tlie down the sides display enough of its internal to prove that comparatively long periods of between many distinct during which the ceased to flow and became permanent additions to the bulk of the growing mountain with alternate haste and succeeded

have between violent like gigantic rock instead of water work and rest and we have no sure means of knowing whether they are dead when still or only sleeping along the western base of the range a telling series of rocks containing the early history of the are now being studied but leaving for the present these first chapters we see that only a very short time ago just before the coming on of that winter of called the period a vast of rocks poured from many a chasm and on the and summit of the range filling lake and river channels and nearly every existing feature on the northern portion at length these all destroying floods ceased to flow but while the great built up along the still burned and smoked the whole passed under the domain of ice and snow then over the bald fire blackened mountains began to crawl covering them from the to the sea with a mantle of ice and then with infinite deliberation the work went on of 
71,the range anew these mighty agents of halting never through centuries crushed and ground the and beneath their folds wasting and building until in the of time the was bom again brought to light nearly as we behold it to the day with and snow crushed pines at the top of the range wheat fields and orange groves at the foot of it this change from icy darkness and death to life and beauty was slow as we count time and is still going on north and south over all the world wherever exist whether in the form of distinct rivers as in the mountains of asia and the pacific coast or in continuous folds as in portions of joseph land and the lands about the south pole but in no country as far as i know may these majestic changes be studied to better advantage than in the plains and mountains of toward the close of the period when the snow clouds became less fertile and the melting waste of sunshine became greater the lower folds of the ice sheet in of into the sea began to shallow and from the and then move slowly up the of the in compliance with the changes of climate the great white mantle on the mountains broke up into a series of more or less distinct and river like with many and these again were melted and divided into still smaller until now only a few of the smallest branches of the grand system exist on the cool slopes of the summit peaks plants and animals their time

every form warming and and gi owing richer as the years passed away over the mighty so lately suggestive of death and desolation only it is hard without long and loving study to realize the magnitude of the work done on these mountains during the last period by which are only streams of closely snow careful study of the phenomena presented goes to show that the pre condition of the range was comparatively simple one vast wave of stone in which a thousand mountains etc lay concealed and in the development of these e chose for a tool not the earthquake or lightning to and split asunder not the stormy torrent or rain but the tender noiselessly falling through centuries the offspring of the sun and sea laboring in united strength they crushed and ground and wore away the rocks in their march making vast beds of soil and at the same time de the and fashioned the into the delightful variety of hill and and mountain that mortals call beauty perhaps more than a mile in average depth has the range been thus degraded during the last period â a quantity of mechanical work almost great and our must be excited again and again as we toil and study and learn that this vast job of so far reaching in its influences was done by agents so fragile and small as are these flowers of the mountain clouds strong only by force of numbers they carried away entire mountains i article by block by block and cast them into the sea fashioned all the range and developed its beauty all these new were evidently for the physical structure of the rocks on which the f es of the scenery depend was acquired while they lay at least a mile deep below the pre surface and it was while these features were taking form in the depths of the range the of the rocks marching to their appointed places in the dark with reference to the coming beauty that the of icy in the sky marching to the same music assembled to bring them to the light then after their gi and task was done these bands of snow flowers these mighty were melted and removed as if of no more importance than dew destined to last but an hour few however of nature s agents have left monuments so noble and enduring as they the great granite a mile high the as deep the noble peaks the valleys these and indeed the mountains of nearly all other features of the scenery are monuments contemplating the works of these flowers of the sky one may easily fancy them endowed with life messengers sent down to work in the mountain mines on errands of divine love silently flying through the darkened air to their appointed places they seem to have taken counsel together saying come we are feeble let us help one another we are many and together we will be strong marching in close deep ranks let us roll away the stones from these mountain and set the free let us these here let us a lake basin there a valley here a channel for a river with steps and brows for the plunge of yonder let us spread broad sheets of soil that man and beast may be fed and here pile trains of for pines and giant here make ground for a meadow there for a garden and grove making it smooth and fine for small and and beds of it well with and thus and so on it has seemed to me sang and planned and labored the hearty snow flower and nothing that i can write can possibly the gi and beauty 
71,of their work like morning mist they have vanished in sunshine all save the few small companies that still linger on the and as are still busily at work the last of the lake the last beds of soil and the of some of the highest peaks chapter ii the of the small mentioned in the preceding chapter i have found sixty five in that portion of the range lying between latitude â and â they occur singly or in small groups on the north sides of the peaks of the high sheltered beneath broad frosty shadows in of their own making where the snow shooting down from the surrounding heights in is most abundant over two thirds of the entire number lie between latitude â and â and form the highest fountains of the san and s rivers the of like those of the are mere wasting of mighty that once filled

eveiy in the world is smaller than it once was all the world is growing warmer or the crop of snow flowers is but in contemplating the condition of the of the the world we must bear in mind while trying to ac count for the changes going on that the same sunshine that them them every records the expenditure of an enormous amount of sun heat in lifting the for the snow of which it is made from the ocean to the mountains as strikingly shows the number of in the according to the brothers is of which may be regarded as and the total area of ice snow and is estimated at square miles or an average for each of little more than one square mile on the same authority the average height above sea level at which they melt is about feet the below feet and one of the reaches nearly as low a point one of the largest of the on the head waters of the does not according to captain descend below feet the largest of the on mount to within feet of the level of the sea which as far as i have observed is the lowest point reached by any within the bounds of the average height of all being not far from feet the changes that have taken place in the conditions of the from the time of greatest extension is well illustrated by the series of of every size and form extending along the mountains of the coast to a general of this instructive region shows that to the north of through and washington groups of active still exist on all the the mountains of high of the range â mount the three sisters hood st baker and others â some of them of considerable size though none of them the sea

as far as my own observations have reached after a pretty thorough examination of the region not more than twenty five discharge into the sea all the long high walled into which these of the first class flow are of course crowded with of every conceivable form which are detached with thundering noise at intervals of a few minutes from an imposing ice that is thrust forward into deep water but these pacific coast are small as compared with those of and the region and only a few of them escape from the intricate system of channels with which this portion of the coast is fringed into the open

over the land by the wearing away of its shores is well known but in these icy regions of and even as far south as island the coast rocks have been so short a time exposed to wave action they are but little wasted as yet in these regions the extension of the sea effected by its own action in post time is scarcely as compared with that effected by ice action traces of the vanished made during the period of greater extension abound on the as far south as latitude even the polished rock the most of records are still found in a wonderfully perfect state of preservation on the upper half of the middle portion of the range and form the most striking of all the phenomena they occur in large irregular patches in the summit and middle regions and though they have been subjected to the action of the weather with its storms for thousands of years their mechanical excellence is such that they still reflect the like glass and the attract the attention of every observer the attention of the is seldom arrested by however regular and high they may be or by however deep or by rocks however noble in form and but he and his hands on the shining and tries hard to account for their mysterious he

winds of all the agents he knows seem capable of flowing in the directions indicated by the indians usually so little curious about phenomena have come to me occasionally and asked me what the ground so smooth at lake even horses and dogs gaze at the strange brightness of the ground and smell the polished spaces and place their feet cautiously on them when they come to them for the first time as if afraid of sinking the most perfect of the polished and walls lie at an elevation of from to feet above the sea where the rock is compact granite small dim patches may be found as low as feet on the and most enduring portions of sheer walls with a southern exposure and on compact swelling partially protected from rain by a covering of large on the north half of the range the and polished are less common not only because this part of the chain is lower but because the surface rocks are the mountains of chiefly subject to comparatively rapid waste the ancient also though well preserved on most of the south half of the range are nearly to the northward but their material is found scattered and a similar condition of the superficial records of action throughout most of washington british and due in gi eat part to the action of excessive moisture even in where the most extensive on the continent are the more of the traces of their former greater extension though comparatively recent are more obscure than those of the ancient where the climate is and the rocks more resisting these general views of the of the pacific coast will enable my readers to see something of the changes that have taken place in and will throw light on the of the high prior to the autumn of the of the were unknown in october of that year i discovered the black mountain in a shadowy between black and red mountains two of the peaks of the group this group is the highest portion of a spur that out from the main of the range in the direction of valley at the time of this interesting discovery i was exploring the of the group and tracing the courses of the ancient that once poured from its ample fountains through the basin and the the valley not expecting to find any active so far south in the land of sunshine beginning on the extremity of the group i the chief in succession their and splendid taking them in regular succession without any reference to the time consumed in their study 
72,the monuments of the that ed its ice from between red and black mountains i found to be the most interesting of them all and when i saw its magnificent extending in majestic curves from the spacious between the mountains i was with the work that lay before me it was one of the golden days of the indian summer when the rich sunshine every landscape however rocky and cold and suggests anything rather than the path of the vanished was warm now and shone in many places as if washed with silver the tall pines gi owing on the stood in the glowing light the groves on the of the basin were masses of orange yellow and the added gold to gold pushing on over my rosy highway i passed lake after lake set in solid of granite and many a thicket and meadow watered by a stream that issues from the and links the lakes together now through knee deep in yellow and purple now passing over bare rock the main that bounded the view on either hand are from to nearly feet high and about as regular as artificial em the mountains of and covered with a superb growth of silver fir and pine but this garden and forest was speedily left behind the trees were as i ascended patches of the and began to appear and pressed into flat carpets by the winter snow the which a few miles down the valley were so richly embroidered with meadows had here at an elevation of feet only small brown of leaving bare rocks around more than half their shores yet amid this the mountain pine bravely tossed his storm beaten branches on the and of red mountain some specimens being over feet high and feet in seemingly as fresh and vigorous as the giants of the lower evening came on just as i got fairly within the of the main it is about a mile wide and a little less than two miles long the crumbling spurs and of red mountain bound it on the north the rudely of black mountain on the south and a col around from mountain to mountain it in on the east i chose a ground on the brink of one of the lakes where a thicket of sheltered me from the night wind then after making a tin of tea i sat by my camp fire reflecting on the grandeur and significance of the records i had seen as the night advanced the mighty rock walls of my mountain mansion seemed to come nearer while the sky in glorious brightness stretched across like a ceiling from wall the to wall and fitted closely down into all the of tlie then after a long fireside rest and a glance at my note book i cut a few leafy for a bed and fell into the clear death like sleep of the tired early next morning i set out to trace the grand old that had done so much for the beauty of the region back to its farthest fountains enjoying the charm that every feels in nature s the voices of the mountains were still asleep the wind scarce stirred the pine needles the sun was up but it was yet too cold for the birds and the few animals that dwell here only the stream from pool to pool seemed to be wholly awake yet the spirit of the opening day called to action the came streaming through the jagged of the col glancing on the and lighting the silvery lakes while every sun touched rock burned white on its edges like melting iron in a furnace passing round the north shore of my camp lake i followed the central stream past many from to the scenery became more rigidly the dwarf pines and disappeared and the stream was bordered with as the sun rose higher rocks were loosened on shattered portions of the cliffs and came down in rattling echoing wildly from to the main that extend from the jaws of the into the basin are continued in straggling masses along the walls of the while separate hun the mountains of of tons in weight are left here and there out in the middle of the channel here also i observed a series of small ranged along the south wall of the corresponding in size and form with the shadows cast by the highest portions the meaning of this between and shadows was afterward made plain tracing the stream back to the last of its chain of i noticed a deposit of fine gi ay mud on the bottom except where the force of the entering cm rent had prevented its it looked like the mud worn from a and i at once suspected its origin for the stream that was carrying it came out of the base of a raw that seemed in process of formation not a plant or weather stain was visible on its rough unsettled surface it is from to over feet high and forward at an angle of â cautiously picking my way i gained the top of the and was delighted to see a small but well down from the gloomy of black mountain in a finely curve to the on which i stood the compact ice appeared on all the lower portions of the though gray with dirt and stones in it farther up the ice disappeared beneath coarse snow the surface of the was further by dirt bands and the edges of the blue veins showing the structure of the ice the uppermost or where the was attached to the mountain was from to feet wide and was in a few places the by the remains of snow creeping along the edge of the holding on with fingers i discovered clear sections where the structure was beautifully revealed the surface snow though sprinkled with stones shot from the cliffs was in some 
72,places almost pure gi becoming and changing to ice of different shades of color and this again changing at a depth of or feet to blue ice some of the ribbon like bands of which were nearly pure and blended with the paler bands in the most gradual and delicate manner imaginable a series of ragged enabled me to make my way down into the weird under world of the its hollows were hung with a multitude of clustered amid which pale subdued light and with indescribable loveliness water and overhead and from far below came strange solemn from cm rents that were f their way through veins and in the dark the chambers of a are perfectly notwithstanding one feels out of place in their frosty beauty i was soon cold in my shirt sleeves and the leaning wall threatened to me yet it was hard to leave the delicious music of the water and the lovely light coming again to the surface i noticed of every size on their journeys to the â journeys of more than a hundred years without a single stop night or day winter or summer the sun gave birth to a of sweet that ran gracefully down the curling and in their shining channels and cut the mountains of ting clear sections through the surface ice into the solid blue where the structure of the was beautifully illustrated the series of small which i had observed in the morning along the south wall of the correspond in every way with the of this and their distribution with reference to shadows was now understood when the changes came on that caused the melting and retreat of the main that filled the a series of were left in the cliff shadows under the protection of which they lingered until they formed the we are studying then as the snow became still less abundant all of them vanished in succession except the one just described and the cause of its longer life is sufficiently apparent in the greater area of snow basin it and its more perfect protection from wasting sunshine how much longer this little will last depends of course on the amount of snow it receives from year to year as compared with melting waste after this discovery i made excursions over all the high pushing my summer after summer and discovered that what at first sight in the distance looked like extensive were in great part busily at work the of the summit peaks so blocked out by their giant on august i set a series of in the g near mount and found its rate of motion to be little more than an inch a day in the middle showing a great contrast to the the in which near the front flows at a rate of from five to ten feet in twenty four hours mount has three but mount although it is the highest mountain in the range does not now cherish a single small patches of lasting snow and ice occur on its northern slopes but they are shallow and present no well marked evidence of motion its sides however are and polished in many places by the action of its ancient that flowed east and west as of the great that once filled the valleys of the and s rivers iii the snow the st snow that the usually falls about the end of october or early in november to a depth of a few inches after months of the most charming indian summer weather imaginable but in a few days this light covering mostly from the slopes exposed to the sun and causes but little apprehension on the part of who may be lingering among the high peaks at this time the first general winter storm that snow that is to form a lasting portion of the season s supply seldom breaks on the mountains before the end of november then warned by the sky cautious together with the wild sheep deer and most of the birds and bears make haste to the or foot hills and owing mountain and such people go into winter quarters some of them not again to see the of day until the general awakening and of the spring in june or july the first heavy f au is usually from about two to four feet in depth then with intervals of splendid sunshine storm storm snow on snow thirty to fifty feet has fallen but on account of its settling and compact the snow ing and the almost constant waste from melting and the average depth actually found at any time seldom ten feet in the forest region or fifteen feet along the slopes of the summit peaks even during the weather never wholly ceases and the sunshine that between the storms is sufficiently powerful to melt the surface more or less through all the winter months waste from melting also goes on to some extent on the bottom from heat stored up in the rocks and given slowly to the snow in contact with them as is shown by the rising of the streams on all the higher regions after the first and their steady sustained flow all winter the greater portion of the snow deposited around the lofty of the range falls in small crisp and broken or when accompanied by strong winds and low temperature the instead of being locked together in their fall to form are beaten and broken into meal and fine dust but down in the forest region the greater portion comes gently to the gi light and some of the in mild weather being nearly an inch in and it is distributed and kept from drifting to any great extent by the shelter afforded by the large trees every tree during the progress of gentle storms is loaded with fairy bloom at the and darkest time of year bending the branches and every singing needle 
72,but as soon as the storm is over and the sun shines the snow at once begins to shift and settle and fall from the branches in the mountains of miniature and the white forest soon becomes green again the snow on the ground also settles and every bright day and at night until it becomes and loses every trace of its structure and then a man may walk firmly over its frozen surface as if on ice the forest region up to an elevation of feet is usually in great part free from snow in june but at this time the higher regions are still heavy laden and are not touched by spring weather to any considerable extent before the middle or end of one of the most striking effects of the snow on the mountains is the burial of the rivers and small lakes as the fa s in the river a moment white then lost forever sang in the fleeting character of human pleasure the st that fall into the rivers vanish thus suddenly but in great storms when the temperature is low the abundance of the snow at length the water nearly to the point and then of course it ceases to melt and the snow so suddenly the falling and form cloud like masses of blue which are swept forward with the current and carried down to warmer many miles distant while some are lodged against logs and rocks and projecting points of the banks and last for days piled high above the level of the water and show white again instead of being at once lost forever while the rivers themselves the snow are at length lost for months during the snowy period the snow is first built out from the banks in over curling and until the streams are they then flow in the dark beneath a continuous covering across the snowy which is about thirty miles wide all the rivers and their in these high regions are thus lost eveiy winter as if another period had come on not a drop of running water is to be seen excepting at a few points where large falls though the and of the heavier currents may still be heard toward spring when the weather is warm during the day and frosty at night repeated and and new of snow render the masses dense and firm so that one may safely walk across the streams or even lead a horse across them without danger of falling through in june the parts of the winter ceiling and those most exposed to sunshine begin to give way forming dark rugged edged pit like sinks at the bottom of which the water may be seen at the end of june only here and there may the find a secure snow bridge the most lasting of the winter bridges from below as well as from above because of warm currents of air passing through the are strikingly arched and and by the occasional of the dripping water of the ceiling they become brightly and icy in some of the reaches where there is a free margin we may walk through them small appearing here and there these are not very dark the the mountains of roaring river all the way with loud music which is at times by the a bird that is not afraid to go wherever a stream may go and to sing wherever a stream sings all the small pools and are in like manner from the winter either by being first frozen and then covered by snow or by being filled in by the first of the season shot into a lake basin may perhaps find the surface frozen then there is a grand crashing of breaking ice and dashing of waves mingled with the low deep of the detached masses of the snow mixed with fragments of ice drift about in island like heaps while the main body of it forms a with its base wholly or in part resting on the bottom of the basin as controlled by its depth and the size of the the next of course still farther and so on with each in succession until the entire basin may be filled and its water up or this huge mass of more or less mixed with sand stones and perhaps timber is frozen to a considerable depth and much sun heat is required to it some of these unfortunate are not clear of ice and snow until near the end of summer others are never quite free opening only on the side opposite the entrance of the some show only a narrow of water lying between the shore and sheer of icy snow masses of which breaking off float in front like in a miniature ocean while the the snow heaps leaning back against the mountains look like small the cliffs are in some instances quite picturesque and with the waters in front of them lighted with sunshine are exceedingly beautiful it often happens that while one side of a lake basin is hopelessly snow buried and frozen the other enjoying sunshine is adorned with beautiful flower gardens some of the smaller lakes are extinguished in an instant by a heavy either of rocks or snow the rolling sliding ponderous mass entering on one side sweeps across the bottom and up the opposite side the water and even the basin clean and the accumulated rocks and up the farther bank and taking full possession the water is in part absorbed but most of it is sent around the front of the and down the channel of the outlet roaring and hurrying as if frightened and glad to escape snow the most magnificent storm phenomenon i ever saw surpassing in the most im i effects of clouds floods or was the peaks of the high back of valley decorated with snow many of the snow flowers out of which these are 
73,made fall before they are ripe while most of those that do attain perfect development as six and against one another in their fall through the frosty air and are broken into the mountains of fragments this dry snow is still further prepared for the formation of by the action of the wind for instead of finding rest at once like the snow which falls into the tranquil depths of the forests it is rolled over and over beaten against rock and in and hollows like pebbles and sand in the pot holes of a river until finally the delicate angles of the are worn off and the whole mass is reduced to dust and whenever storm winds find this prepared snow dust in a loose condition on exposed slopes where there is a free upward sweep to it is tossed back into the sky and borne onward from peak to peak in the form of or cloudy according to the of the wind and the of the slopes up or around which it is driven while thus flying through the air a small portion makes good its escape and remains in the sky as but far the greater part after being driven into the sky again and again is at length locked fast in or in the of some of it to remain silent and rigid for centuries before it is finally melted and sent singing down the to the sea yet notwithstanding the abundance of winter snow dust in the mountains and the of high winds and the length of time the dust remains loose and exposed to their action the occurrence of well formed is for causes we shall hereafter note comparatively rare i have seen only one display of this kind that seemed in every way perfect this was in the winter of when the the snow snow laden were swept by a wild i happened at the time to be in valley that sublime temple where eveiy day one may see the sights yet even here the wild day of the north wind seemed glorious i was awakened in the morning by the rocking of my cabin and the beating of pine on the roof detached torrents and from the main wind flood overhead were rushing wildly down the narrow side and over the walls with loud roar rousing the pines to enthusiastic action and making the whole valley as though it were an instrument being played but afar on the lofty exposed peaks of the range standing so high in the sky the storm was expressing itself in still characters which i was soon to see in all their glory i had long been anxious to study some points in the structure of the ice that is formed every winter at the foot of the upper fall but the blinding spray by which it is invested had hitherto prevented me from making a sufficiently near approach this morning the entire body of the fall was torn into and blown along the face of the cliff leaving the dry and while making my way to the top of an overlooking ledge to seize so favorable an opportunity to examine the interior of the the peaks of the group came in sight over the shoulder of the south dome each waving a banner against the blue sky as regular in form and as firm in texture as if woven of fine silk so rare and splendid a the mountains of of course all other considerations and i at once let the ice go and began to force my way out of the valley to some dome or ridge sufficiently lofty to command a general view of the main feeling assured that i should find them still more nor was i in the least disappointed indian through which i climbed was choked with snow that had been shot down in from the high on either side rendering the ascent difficult but ed by the roaring storm the tedious brought no fatigue and in four hours i gained the top of a ridge above the valley feet high and there in bold relief like a clear painting appeared a most imposing scene innumerable peaks black and sharp rose into the dark blue sky their set in solid white their sides and with snow like ocean rocks with foam and from every summit all free and was streaming a beautiful silvery banner from half a mile to a mile in length slender at the point of attachment then gradually as it extended from the peak until it was about or feet in breadth as near as i could estimate the cluster of peaks called the crown of the at the head of the and rivers â with their nameless â each had its own banner waving with a clearly visible motion in the and there was not a single cloud in the sky to mar their simple grandeur fancy yourself standing on this ridge looking eastward you notice a strange the snow glitter in the au the gale drives wildly overhead with a fierce roar but its violence is not felt for you are looking through a sheltered opening in the woods as through a window there in the immediate of your picture rises a majestic forest of silver fu blooming in eternal freshness the yellow gi een and the snow beneath the trees strewn with their beautiful plucked by the wind beyond and extending over all the middle ground are of pine interrupted by huge swelling and and just beyond the dark forest you see the of the high waving their magnificent they are twenty miles away but you would not wish them nearer for every feature is distinct and the whole glorious show is seen in its right proportions after this general view mark how sharply the dark ribs and and of the peaks are defined excepting the portions veiled by the and how delicately their sides 
73,are with snow where it has come to rest in and mark too how the wave as the wind is against their sides and how each is attached to the very summit of its peak like a at a how smooth and they are in texture and how finely their fading are on the sky see how dense and they are at the point of attachment and how and toward the end so that the peaks back of them are seen dimly as though you were looking through ground glass yet again observe how some of the the mountains of longest belonging to the stream perfectly free all the way across intervening and passes from peak to peak while others and partly hide each other and consider how keenly every of this wondrous cloth of snow is flashing out of light these are the main features of the beautiful and terrible picture as seen from the forest window and it would stiu be glorious were the fore and altogether leaving only the black peaks the white and the blue sky now in a general way at the formation of snow we find that the main causes of the wondrous beauty and perfection of those we have been contemplating were the favorable direction and gi eat force of the wind the abundance of snow dust and the peculiar of the slopes of the peaks it is essential not only that the wind should move with great and to supply a sufficiently copious and continuous stream of snow dust but that it should come from the north no perfect banner is ever hung on the peaks by a south wind had the gale that day blown from the south leaving other conditions unchanged only a dull confused fog like drift would have been produced for the snow instead of being up over the tops of the peaks in concentrated currents to be drawn out as would have been shed off around the sides and piled down into the the cause of the concentrated action of the north wind is found in the peculiar form of the north sides of the peaks where the of the the snow are in general the south sides are and irregular while the north sides are both in their and sections the wind in ascending these curves toward the carrying the snow in currents with it shooting it almost straight up into the air above the peaks from which it is then away in a direction this difference in form between the north and south sides of the peaks was almost wholly produced by the difference in the kind and quantity of the to which they have been subjected the north sides having been by shadow of a form that never existed on the sun beaten sides it appears therefore that shadows in great part determine not only the forms of lofty icy mountains but also those of the snow that the wild winds hang on them chapter iv a near view of the high early one bright morning in the middle of indian summer while the meadows were still crisp with frost i set out from the foot of mount on my way down to valley to my exhausted store of bread and tea i had spent the past summer as many preceding ones exploring the that lie on the head waters of the san and s rivers measuring and studying their movements etc and the part they had played during the period of their greater extension in the creation and development of the of this the time for this kind of work was nearly over for the year and i began to look forward with delight to the approaching winter with its wondrous storms when i would be warmly snow bound in my cabin with plenty of bread and books but a tinge of regret came on when i considered that possibly i might not see this favorite region again until the next summer excepting distant views from the heights about the walls to artists few portions of the high are strictly speaking picturesque the whole massive a view of the high of the range is one gi eat picture not clearly into smaller ones much in this respect from the older and what may be called mountains of the coast range all the of the as we have seen were born again from base to summit by the developing of the last winter but all these new were not brought forth simultaneously some of the highest where the ice longest are of younger than those of the warmer regions below them in general the younger the mountain â younger i mean with reference to the time of their from the ice of the period â the less are they into artistic bits capable of being made into warm sympathetic es with humanity in them here however on the head waters of the is a group of wild peaks on which the may say that the sun has but just begun to shine which is yet in a high degree picturesque and in its main es so regular and balanced as almost to appear conventional â one cluster of snow laden peaks with gray gi around its base the whole free into the sky from the head of a magnificent valley whose lofty walls are away on both sides so as to embrace it all without admitting anything not strictly belonging to it the was now with autumn colors brown and purple and gold ripe in the mellow sunshine brightly with the deep blue of the sky and the black and gray and pure the mountains of spiritual of the rocks and down through the midst the young was seen from its crystal fountains now resting in pools as if changing back again into ice now leaping in white as if turning to snow gliding right and left between granite then sweeping on through the 
73,smooth of the valley swaying from side to side with calm stately gestures past dipping and and around groves of pine and throughout its whole course whether flowing fast or slow singing loud or low ever filling the landscape with spiritual animation and the of its sources in every movement and tone pursuing my lonely way down the valley i turned again and again to gaze on the glorious picture throwing up my arms to it as in a frame after long ages of growth in the darkness beneath the through sunshine and storms it seemed now to be ready and waiting for the elected artist like yellow wheat for the and i could not help wishing that i might carry colors and with me on my travels and learn to paint in the mean time i had to be content with photographs on my mind and sketches in my note books at length after i had rounded a that puts out from the west wall of the valley every peak vanished from sight and i pushed rapidly along the frozen meadows over the divide between the waters of the and and down through the forests that clothe the slopes of cloud s arriving in in due time â which a view of the high with me is any time and strange to say among the first people i met here were two artists who with letters of introduction were awaiting my return they inquired whether in the course of my in the adjacent mountains i had ever come upon a landscape suitable for a large painting whereupon i began a description of the one that had so lately excited my admiration then as i went on further and further into details their faces began to glow and i offered to guide them to it while they declared that they would gladly follow far or near i could e the time to lead them since storms might come breaking down through the fine weather at any time the colors in snow and cutting off the artists retreat i advised getting ready at once i led them out of the valley by the and falls thence over the main dividing ridge to the big meadows by the old trail and thence along the upper river to its head this was my companions first excursion into the high and as i was almost always alone in my the way that the fresh beauty was reflected in their faces made for me a novel and interesting study they naturally were affected most of all by the colors â the intense of the sky the of the granite the red and of dry meadows and the purple and crimson of the flaming yellow of groves the silvery flashing of the streams and the bright green and blue of the lakes but the general the mountains of sion of the scenery â rocky and savage â seemed sadly and as they the forest from ridge to ridge eagerly the as they were unfolded they said all this is huge and sublime but we see nothing as yet at all available for effective pictures art is long and art is limited you know and here are middle gi all alike bare rock waves woods groves of meadow and of glittering water never mind i replied only bide a and i will show you something you will like at length toward the end of the second day the crown began to come into view and when we had fairly rounded the projecting before mentioned the whole picture stood revealed in the flush of the their enthusiasm was excited beyond bounds and the more impulsive of the two a young dashed ahead shouting and and tossing his arms in the air like a madman here at last was a typical landscape after awhile on the view i proceeded to make camp in a sheltered grove a little way back from the meadow where pine boughs could be obtained for beds and where there was plenty of for fires while the artists ran here and there along the river and up the sides of the choosing for sketches after dark when our tea was made and a rousing fire had been built we began to make our plans they decided to remain several days at the least while i con a view of the high to make an excursion in the mean time to the untouched summit of bitter it was now about the middle of october the of snow flowers the first winter clouds had already and the peaks were strewn with fresh without however affecting the climbing to any dangerous extent and as the weather was still profoundly calm and the distance to the foot of the mountain only a little more than a day i felt that i was running no gi eat risk of being storm bound mount is king of the mountains of the middle portion of the high as of the north and of the south sections moreover as far as i know it had never been climbed i had the adjacent wilderness summer after summer but my studies thus far had never drawn me to the top of it its height above sea level is about feet and it is round by inclined and of tremendous depth and which render it almost inaccessible but difficulties of this kind only the next morning the artists went heartily to their work and i to mine former experiences had given good reason to know that passionate storms invisible as yet might be brooding in the calm therefore before bidding farewell i warned the artists not to be alarmed should i fail to appear before a week or ten days and advised them in case a snow storm should set in to keep up big fires and shelter themselves as best they could and the mountains op on no account to become frightened and attempt to 
73,seek their way back to alone through the my general plan was simply this to scale the wall cross over to the eastern flank of the range and then make my way southward to the northern s of mount in compliance with the intervening for to push on directly southward from camp through the innumerable peaks and that adorn this portion of the of the range however interesting would take too much time besides being extremely difficult and dangerous at this time of year all my first day was pure pleasure simply indulgence crossing the dry of the ancient tracing happy streams and learning the habits of the birds and in the groves and rocks before i had gone a mile from camp i came to the foot of a white that beats its way down a rugged in the wall from a height of about nine hundred feet and its throbbing waters into the i was acquainted with its fountains which fortunately lay in my course what a fine companion it proved to be what songs it sang and how passionately it told the mountain s own joy i climbed along its dashing border absorbing its divine music and bathing from time to time in of spray climbing higher higher new beauty came streaming on the sight painted meadows late blooming gardens peaks of rare architecture lakes here and there shining like silver and glimpses of the a view of the high middle region and the yellow far in the west beyond the range i saw the so called desert lying silent in thick purple light â a desert of heavy sun glare beheld from a desert of ice granite here the waters divide shouting in glorious enthusiasm and falling eastward to vanish in the sands and dry sky of the great basin or westward to the great valley of and thence through the bay of san and the golden gate to the sea passing a little way down over the summit until i had reached an elevation of about feet i pushed on southward toward a group of savage peaks that stand guard about on the north and west gi my way and dealing instinctively with eveiy obstacle as it presented itself here a huge would be found cutting across my path along the dizzy edge of which i scrambled until some less point was discovered where i might safely venture to the bottom and then selecting some portion of the opposite wall with the same slow caution massive flat s alternate with the plunging abruptly from the shoulders of the snowy peaks and planting their feet in the warm desert these were everywhere marked and adorned with of the ancient that swept over this entire region like one vast ice wind and the polished sm faces produced by the ponderous flood are still so perfectly preserved that in many places the sunlight reflected from them is about as trying to the eyes as sheets of snow god s mills grind slowly but they have the mountains of been kept in motion long enough in to grind sufficient soil for a glorious abundance of life though most of the has been carried to the leaving these high regions comparatively lean and bare while the post agents of have not yet fm sufficient available food over the general surface for more than a few of the plants chiefly and and it is interesting to learn in this connection that the and repressed character of the vegetation at this height is caused more by want of soil than by of climate for here and there in sheltered hollows beneath the general sm f ace into which a few rods of have been we find groves of and pine thirty to forty feet high trimmed around the edges with willow and bushes and still further by an outer ring of tall bright with and suggesting a climate by no means severe all the streams too and the pools at this elevation are furnished with little gardens wherever soil can be made to lie which though making scarce any show at a distance constitute charming surprises to the observer in these bits of a few birds find grateful homes having no acquaintance with man they fear no ill and curiously about the stranger almost allowing themselves to be taken in the hand in so wild and so beautiful a region was spent my first day every sight and sound inspiring leading one far out of himself yet feeding and building up his individuality a view of the high now came the solemn silent evening long blue shadows crept out across the snow fields while a rosy glow at first scarce gradually deepened and every mountain top flushing the and the harsh above them this was the to me one of the most impressive of all the of god at the touch of this divine light the mountains to to a religious consciousness and stood hushed and waiting like devout just before the began to fade two crimson clouds came streaming across the summit like wings of flame rendering the sublime scene yet more impressive then came darkness and the stars icy was still miles away but i could proceed no farther that night i found a good on the rim of a basin about feet above the sea a small lake in the bottom of it from which i got water for my tea and a thicket near by furnished abundance of fire wood peaks and shattered half way around the horizon wearing a savage aspect in the and a solemnly across the lake on its way down from the foot of a the fall and the lake and the were almost equally bare while the pines in the were so and by storm winds that you might walk over their tops in tone and aspect the scene was one of the most desolate i ever beheld but the darkest es of 
74,the are with bright passages of love the mountains op that never fail to make themselves felt when one is alone i made my bed in a nook of the pine thicket where the branches were pressed and overhead like a roof and bent down around the sides these are the best the high mountains afford â snug as nests well full of and with plenty of wind played needles to sing one asleep i little expected company but creeping in through a low side door i found five or six birds among the the night wind began to blow soon after dark at first only a gentle breathing but increasing toward midnight to a rough gale that fell upon my leafy roof in ragged like a bearing wild sounds from the overhead the sang in chorus filling the old ice fountain with its solemn roar and seeming to increase in power as the night advanced â fit voice for such a landscape i had to creep out many times to the fire during the night for it was biting cold and i had no blankets gladly i welcomed the morning star the dawn in the dry wavering air of the desert was glorious everything encouraged my undertaking and success there was no cloud in the sky no storm tone in the wind breakfast of bread and tea was soon made i fastened a hard crust to my belt by way of provision in case i should be compelled to pass a night on the mountain top then securing the remainder of my little stock against wolves and wood rats i set forth free and hopeful how glorious a gi the sun gives the a near view of the high to behold this alone is worth the pains of any excursion a thousand times over the highest peaks burned like islands in a sea of liquid shade then the lower peaks and caught the glow and long of light streaming through many a and pass fell thick on the frozen meadows the majestic form of bitter was full in sight and i pushed rapidly on over rounded rock and my iron shod making a sound suddenly hushed now and then in of and lake soft as moss here too in this so called land of desolation i met growing in among the battered rocks her blossoms had faded long ago but they were still clinging with happy memories to the and still so beautiful as to thrill every of one s being winter and summer you may hear her voice the low sweet melody of her purple bells no among all the mountain plants speaks nature s love more plainly than where she dwells the of the solitude is complete the very rocks and seem to feel her presence and become with her own fountain sweetness all things were warming and awakening frozen began to flow the came out of their nests in piles and climbed sunny rocks to and the headed were flitting about seeking their the lakes seen from every ridge top were brilliantly and like the of the low dwarf pines the rocks too seemed to the vital heat â rock and snow thrill the mountains of ing alike i on as if never more to feel fatigue limbs moving of themselves every sense like the flowers to take part in the new day harmony all along my course thus far excepting when down in the the were mostly open to me and at least on one side on the left were the plains of di and warm on the right the near peaks springing keenly into the thin sky with more and more impressive but these larger views were at length lost spurs and and huge projecting began to shut me in every feature became more rigidly without however producing any effect for going to the mountains is like going home we always find that the strangest objects in these fountain are in some degree familiar and we look upon them with a vague sense of having seen them before on the southern shore of a frozen lake i encountered an extensive field of hard snow up which i in fine tone intending to follow it to its head and cross the rocky spur against which it hoping thus to come direct upon the base of the main peak the surface was with oval hollows made by stones and drifted pine needles that had melted themselves into the mass by the of absorbed sun heat these afforded good but the surface curved more and more at the head and the became and less abundant until i found myself in danger of being a view of the high â shed off like snow i persisted however creeping on all and shuffling up the places on my back as i had often done on granite after slipping several times i was compelled to my course to the bottom and make my way around the west end of the lake and thence up to the summit of the divide between the head waters of rush creek and the of the san arriving on the summit of this dividing crest one of the most exciting pieces of e wilderness was disclosed that i ever discovered in all my there immediately in front loomed the majestic mass of mount with a down its face nearly to my feet then westward and pouring its frozen flood into a dark blue lake whose shores were bound with of snow while a deep chasm drawn between the divide and the separated the massive e from everything else i could see only the one sublime mountain the one the one lake the whole veiled with one blue shadow â rock ice and water close â together without a single leaf or sign of life after gazing i began instinctively to every and and of the mountain with reference to making the ascent the entire front 
74,above the appeared as one tremendous precipice slightly receding at the top and with and set above one another in formidable array massive stood forward here and there the mountains of at the top with and separated by frosty and recesses that have been veiled in shadow ever since their creation while to right and left as far as i could see were huge crumbling offering no hope to the the head of the sends up a few finger like branches through narrow but these seemed too steep and short to be available especially as i had no ax with which to cut steps and the numerous ow down which stones and snow are seemed hopelessly steep besides being interrupted by cliffs while the whole front was rendered still more terribly forbidding by the chill shadow and the gloomy blackness of the rocks descending the divide in a hesitating mood i picked my way across the yawning chasm at the foot and climbed out upon the there were no meadows now to cheer with their brave colors nor could i hear the headed whose cheery notes so often relieve the silence of our highest mountains the only sounds were the of small down in the veins and of the and now and then the rattling report of falling stones with the echoes they shot out into the crisp air i could not distinctly hope to reach the summit from this side yet i moved on across the as if driven by fate with myself the season is too far spent i said and even should i be successful i might be storm bound on the mountain and in the cloud darkness with the cliffs and covered with snow how could i escape f a view of the high no i must wait till next summer i would only approach the now and inspect it creep about its learn what i could of its history holding myself ready to flee on the approach of the first storm cloud but we little know until tried how much of the there is in us urging across and torrents and up dangerous heights let the judgment forbid as it may i succeeded in gaining the foot of the cliff on the eastern extremity of the and there discovered the mouth of a narrow through which i began to climb intending to follow it as far as possible and at least obtain some fine wild views for my pains its general com se is to the plane of the mountain face and the of which the mountain is built are cut by in such a way that they weather off in blocks giving rise to irregular steps that greatly climbing on the sheer places i thus made my way into a wilderness of crumbling and built together in bewildering and glazed in many places with a thin of ice which i had to hammer off with stones the situation was becoming gradually more perilous but having passed several dangerous spots i dared not think of descending for so steep was the entire ascent one would inevitably fall to the in case a single were made knowing therefore the tried danger beneath i became all the more anxious concerning the to be made above and began to be conscious of a vague of what actually not that i was given to fear g the mountains of but rather because my instincts usually so positive and true seemed in way and were leading me astray at length after an elevation of about feet i found myself at the foot of a sheer drop in the bed of the channel i was tracing which seemed absolutely to bar further progress it was only about forty five or fifty feet high and somewhat by and but these seemed so slight and e as that i tried hard to avoid the precipice altogether by the wall of the channel on either side but though less steep the walls were than the rock and repeated efforts only showed that i must either go right ahead or turn back the tried dangers beneath seemed even greater than that of the cliff in front therefore after its face again and again i began to scale it picking my holds with intense caution after gaining a point about to the top i was suddenly brought to a dead stop with aims clinging close to the face of the rock unable to move hand or foot either up or down my doom appeared fixed i must fall there would be a moment of bewilderment and then a lifeless down the one general precipice to the below when this final danger flashed upon me i became nerve shaken for the first time since setting foot on the mountains and my mind seemed to fill with a stifling smoke but this terrible lasted only a moment when life blazed forth again with clearness i seemed suddenly to become possessed of a new sense the other self a view of the high experiences instinct or guardian angel â call it what you will â came forward and assumed control then my trembling muscles became ann again every and flaw in the rock was seen as through a and my limbs moved with a and precision with which i seemed to have nothing at all to do had i been borne aloft upon wings my could not have been more complete above this memorable spot the face of the mountain is still more savagely and torn it is a of yawning and in the angles of which rise and piles of detached that seem to have been gotten ready to be launched below but the strange of strength i had received seemed inexhaustible i found a way without effort and soon stood upon the in the blessed light how truly glorious the landscape around this noble summit â giant mountains valleys innumerable and meadows rivers and lakes with the 
74,wide blue sky bent tenderly over them all but in my first hour of freedom from that terrible shadow the sunlight in which i was seemed all in all looking southward along the of the range the eye is first caught by a row of exceedingly sharp and slender which rise openly to a height of about a thousand feet above a series of short that lean back against their their fantastic and the with which they spring out of the ice rendering them peculiarly wild and striking these the mountains op are the beyond them you behold a sublime wilderness of mountains their snowy towering together in crowded abundance peak beyond peak swelling higher higher as they sweep on southward until the point of the range is reached on mount near the head of the river at an elevation of nearly feet above the level of the sea westward the general flank of the range is seen flowing away from the sharp in smooth a sea of huge gray granite waves dotted with lakes and meadows and with that grow steadily deeper as they in the distance below this gray region lies the dark forest broken here and there by and and yet beyond lies a yellow belt marking the broad plain of the san bounded on its farther side by the blue mountains of the coast turning now to the northward there in the immediate is the glorious crown with cathedral peak a temple of architecture a few degrees to the left of it the gray massive form of mountain to the right while tower peak castle peak silver mountain and a host of noble companions as yet nameless make a sublime show along the of the range eastward the whole region seems a land of desolation covered with beautiful light the basin of with its one bare lake fourteen miles long s valley and the broad table land at its head dotted with and the mountains op the massive range even the in height these are spread map like beneath you with countless beyond passing and one another and fading on the glowing horizon at a distance of less than feet below the summit of mount bitter you may find of the san and s rivers sting forth from the ice and snow of the that load its while a little to the north of here are found the highest of the and thus the fountains of four of the principal rivers of are within a of four or five miles lakes are seen gleaming in all sorts of places â round or oval or square like very others narrow and drawn close around the peaks like silver the highest reflecting only rocks snow and the sky but neither these nor the nor the bits of brown meadow and that occur here and there are large enough to make any marked impression upon the mighty wilderness of mountains the eye rejoicing in its freedom about the vast expanse yet returns again and again to the fountain peaks perhaps some one of the multitude special attention some gigantic castle with and or some cathedral more abundantly than s but generally when looking for the first time from an all embracing like this the inexperienced observer is oppressed by the incomprehensible grandeur variety and abundance of the mountains rising shoulder to shoulder a view op the high beyond the reach of vision and it is only after they have been studied one by one long and lovingly that their far reaching become manifest then penetrate the wilderness where you may the main telling features to which all the surrounding is subordinate are quickly perceived and the most complicated clusters of peaks stand revealed and fashioned like works of art â eloquent monuments of the ancient ice rivers that brought them into relief from the general mass of the range the too some of them a mile deep wildly through the mighty host of mountains however lawless and at first sight they appear are at length recognized as the necessary effects of causes which followed each other in harmonious â nature s poems carved on tables of stone â the simplest and most emphatic of her could we have been here to observe during the period we should have overlooked a ocean of ice as continuous as that now covering the of filling every valley and with only the tops of the fountain peaks rising darkly above the rock ice waves like in a stormy sea â those the only hints of the glorious now smiling in the sun standing here in the deep brooding silence all the wilderness seems motionless as if the work of creation were done but in the midst of this outer we know there is incessant motion and change ever and anon are falling from yonder peaks these cliff bound the mountains of seemingly and immovable are flowing like water and grinding the rocks beneath them the lakes are their granite shores and wearing them away and every one of these and young rivers is the air into music and the mountains to the plains here are the roots of all the life of the valleys and here more simply than elsewhere is the eternal of nature manifested ice changing to water lakes to meadows and mountains to plains and while we thus contemplate nature s methods of landscape creation and reading the records she has carved on the rocks however imperfectly the of the past we also learn that as these we now behold have succeeded those of the age so they in tm n are withering and vanishing to be succeeded by others yet but in the midst of these fine lessons and i had to remember that the sun was far to the west while a new way down the mountain had to be discovered to some point on the timber line where i could have a fire for i had not 
74,even myself with a coat i first the western spurs hoping some way might appear through which i might reach the northern and cross its or pass around the lake into which it flows and thus strike my morning track this route was soon sufficiently unfolded to show that if practicable at all it would require so much time that reaching camp that night would be out of the question i therefore scrambled back eastward descending the southern slopes at the same time here the seemed less f a view of the high able and the head of a that flows came in sight which i determined to follow as far as possible hoping thus to make my way to the foot of the peak on the east side and thence across the intervening and to camp the inclination of the is quite moderate at the head and as the had softened the i made safe and rapid progress running and sliding and keeping up a sharp outlook for about half a mile from the head there is an where the over a sharp and is shattered into massive blocks separated by deep blue es to thread my way through the slippery of this portion seemed impossible and i endeavored to avoid it by climbing off to the shoulder of the mountain but the slopes rapidly and at length fell away in sheer compelling a return to the ice fortunately the day had been warm enough to the ice so as to admit of hollows being dug in the rotten portions of the blocks thus me to pick my way with far less difficulty than i had anticipated continuing down over the and along the left was only a confident showing that the ascent of the mountain by way of this is easy provided one is armed with an ax to cut steps here and there the lower end of the was beautifully waved and barred by the edges of the ice which represent the annual and to some extent the of structure caused by the of the walls of and by separate which have the mountains of followed by rain hail and etc small were gliding and over the melting surface with a smooth appearance in channels of pure ice â their quick movements most with the rigid invisible flow of the itself on whose back they all were riding night di near before i reached the eastern base of the mountain and my camp lay many a rugged mile to the north but ultimate success was assured it was now only a matter of endurance and ordinary mountain craft the sunset was if possible yet more beautiful than that of the day before the landscape seemed to be fairly with warm purple light the peaks along the summit were in shadow but through every and pass streamed vivid soothing and their rough black angles while companies of small luminous clouds hovered above them like very angels of light darkness came on but i found my way by the of the and the peaks projected against the sky all excitement died with the light and then i was weary but the sound of the across the lake was heard at last and soon the stars were seen reflected in the lake itself taking my bearings from these i discovered the little pine thicket in which my nest was and then i had a rest such as only a tired may enjoy after lying loose and lost for awhile i made a sunrise fire went down to the lake dashed water on my head and dipped a for tea the revival brought about by bread and tea was as complete as the exhaustion a view of the high from excessive enjoyment and toil then i crept beneath the pine to bed the wind was frosty and the fire burned low but my sleep was none the less sound and the evening had swept far to the west before i awoke after and resting in the morning sunshine i sauntered home â that is back to the camp â bearing away toward a cluster of peaks that hold the fountain of one of the north of rush creek here i discovered a group of beautiful lakes together in a grand toward evening i crossed the divide separating the waters from those of the and entered the basin that now holds the fountain of the stream that forms the upper this stream i traced down through its many and meadows and reaching the brink of the main at dusk a loud for the artists was answered again and again their camp fire came in sight and half an hour afterward i was with them they seemed glad to see me i had been absent only three days nevertheless though the weather was fine they had already been weighing chances as to whether i would ever return and trying to decide whether they should wait longer or begin to seek their way back to the now their curious troubles were over they packed their precious sketches and next morning we set out homeward bound and in two days entered the valley from the north by way of indian chapter v the passes the sustained grandeur of the high is strikingly illustrated by the great height of the passes between latitude â and â the lowest pass gap or of any kind cutting across the of the range as far as i have discovered feet in height above the level of the sea while the average height of all that are in use either by indians or is perhaps not less than feet and not one of these is a carriage pass farther north a carriage road has been constructed through what is known as the pass on the head waters of the and s rivers the summit of which is about feet above the sea substantial wagon roads have also been built through 
75,the and johnson passes near the head of lake over which immense quantities of freight were hauled from to the regions of before the construction of the central pacific railroad still farther north a considerable number of comparatively low passes occur some of which are accessible to wheeled and through these rugged during the exciting years of the gold the passes period long trains with foot sore cattle wearily toiled after the toil worn had escaped a thousand dangers and had crawled thousands of miles across the plains the snowy at last loomed in sight the eastern wall of the land of gold and as with shaded eyes they gazed through the tremulous haze of the desert with what joy must they have the pass through which they were to enter the better land of their hopes and dreams between the pass and the southern extremity of the high a distance of nearly miles there are only five passes through which conduct from one side of the range to the other these are barely practicable for animals a pass in these regions meaning simply any or through which one may by the exercise of unlimited patience make out to lead a mule or a sure footed animals that can slide or jump as well as walk only three of the five passes may be said to be in use the and virginia creek the tracks leading through the others being only obscure indian not in the least and scarcely by white men for much of the way is over solid rock and earthquake where the of the indians leave no sign only skilled are able to detect the marks that serve to guide the indians such as slight of the rocks the of stones here and there and bent bushes and weeds a general knowledge of the is then the main guide one to determine where the mountains of the trail ought to go â go one of these indian crosses the range by a nameless pass between the head waters of the south and middle forks of the san the other between the north and middle forks of the same river just to the south of the this last being about feet high is the lowest of the five the is the highest crossing the summit near the head of the south fork of king s river about eight miles to the north of mount through the midst of the most rock scenery the summit of this pass is over feet above nevertheless it is one of the safest of the five and is used every summer from july to october or november by hunters and and to some extent by also for besides the surpassing grandeur of the scenery about the summit the trail in ascending the western flank of the range through a gi of the giant and through the magnificent valley of the south fork of king s river this is perhaps the highest pass on the north american continent the pass lies to the east of valley at the head of one of the of the south fork of the this is the best known and most of all that exist in the high a trail was made through it about the time of the gold excitement in the year by adventurous and â men who would build a trail down the throat of darkest on the way to gold though more than a thousand feet lower than the e fl the mountains of it is scarcely less sublime in rock scenery while in snowy falling water it far it being so situated for the stream of travel the more adventurous cross over through this glorious to the region around lake it has therefore gained a name and fame above every other pass in the range according to the few observations made upon it its highest point is feet above the sea the other pass of the five we have been considering is somewhat lower and crosses the of the range a few miles to the north of the pass at the head of the of s river it is used chiefly by bands of the indians and but leaving wheels and animals out of the question the free with a sack of bread on his shoulders and an ax to cut steps in ice and frozen snow can make his way across the range almost everywhere and at any time of year when the weather is calm to him nearly every between the peaks is a pass though much patient step cutting is at times required up and down inclined with cautious climbing over that at first sight would seem hopelessly inaccessible in pursuing my studies i have crossed from side to side of the range at intervals of a few miles all along the highest portion of the chain with far less real danger than one would naturally count on and what fine was thus revealed â storms and lakes and the passes and meadows and interesting animals â only those will ever know who give the and most portion of their lives to climbing and seeing for themselves to the timid fresh from the of the these however picturesque and grand seem terribly forbidding â cold dead gloomy in the bones of the mountains and of all nature s ways the ones to be most cautiously avoided yet they are full of the finest and most telling examples of nature s love and though hard to travel none are safer for they lead through regions that lie far above the ordinary haunts of the devil and of the that walks in darkness true there are innumerable places where the careless step will be the last step and a rock falling from the cliffs may crush without warning like lightning from the sky but what then i accidents in the mountains are less common than in the and these mountain are decent delightful 
75,even divine places to die in compared with the chambers of civilization few places in this world are more dangerous than home fear not therefore to try the mountain passes they will kill care save you from deadly set you free and call forth every faculty into vigorous enthusiastic action even the sick should try these so called dangerous passes because for every they kill they cure a thousand all the passes make their on the eastern flank on this side the average rise is not far from a thousand feet to the mile while on the mountains of the west it is about two hundred feet another marked between the eastern and western portions of the passes is that the former begin at the very foot of the range while the latter can hardly be said to begin lower than an elevation of from seven to ten thousand feet approaching the range from the gray of and s valley on the east the sees before him the steep short passes in full view in by rugged spurs that come plunging down from the shoulders of the peaks on either side the courses of the more direct being disclosed from top to bottom without interruption but from the west one sees nothing of the way he may be seeking until near the summit after days have been spent in the forests growing on the main dividing between the river it is interesting to observe how surely the animals of every kind fall into the same the more rugged and inaccessible the general character of the of any particular region the more surely will the of white men indians bears wild sheep etc be found into the best passes the indians of the western slope venture cautiously over the passes in settled weather to attend dances and obtain loads of pine nuts and the of a small fly that in and s lakes which when dried forms an important article of food while the cross over from the east to hunt the deer and obtain supplies of and it is truly astonishing to see what immense loads the haggard old make out to carry bare the passes footed through these rough passes for a distance of sixty or seventy miles they are always accompanied by the men who stride on and erect a little in advance kindly stooping at difficult places to pile stepping stones for their patient pack animal wives just as they would prepare the way for then bears great sagacity as but although they are and they seldom cross the range i have several times them through the pass but only in late years after cattle and sheep had passed that way when they doubtless were following to feed on the and on those that had been killed by falling over the rocks even the wild sheep the best of all choose regular passes in making journeys across the deer seldom cross the range in either direction i have never yet observed a single specimen of the mule deer of the great basin west of the summit and rarely one of the black species on the eastern slope notwithstanding many of the latter ascend the range nearly to the summit eveiy summer to feed in the wild gardens and bring forth their young the are the pass makers and it is by them that the courses of all are without exception every pass in the was created by them without the slightest aid or guidance from any of the agents i have seen elaborate statements of the amount of and accomplished in the construction of the railroad the mountains op across the above lake but for every pound of rock moved in this way the which descended east and west through this same pass crushed and carried away more than a hundred tons the so called practicable road passes are simply those portions of the range more degraded by action than the adjacent portions and degraded in such a way as to leave the rounded instead of sharp while the peaks from the superior strength and hardness of their rocks or from more favorable position having suffered less degradation are left towering above the passes as if they had been heaved into the sky by some force acting from beneath the scenery of all the passes especially at the head is of the wildest and description â lofty peaks together and laden around their with ice and snow chains of lakes streams in endless variety with glorious views westward over a sea of rocks and woods and eastward over strange plains and the dry dead looking of the great basin every pass however possesses treasures of beauty all its own having thus in a general way indicated the height leading features and distribution of the principal passes i will now endeavor to describe the pass in particular which may i think be regarded as a fair example of the higher passes in general the main portion of the pass is formed the passes by bloody which begins at the summit of the range and runs in a general east direction to the edge of the plain the first white men who forced a way through its depths were as we have seen eager gold but the was known and as a pass by the indians and mountain animals long before its discovery by white men as is shown by the numerous which come into it from every direction its name well with the character of the early times in and may perhaps have been suggested by the color of the in which it is in great part or more probably by blood made by the unfortunate animals which were compelled to slip and awkwardly over its rough cutting rocks i have never known an animal either mule or horse to make its way through the either in going up or down without losing more or less blood from 
75,wounds on the legs occasionally one is killed outright â falling headlong and rolling over like a but such accidents are than from the terrible appearance of the trail one would be led to expect the more experienced when driven loose find their way over the dangerous places with a caution and sagacity that is truly wonderful during the gold excitement it was at times a matter of considerable pecuniary importance to force a way through the with pack trains early in the spring while it was yet heavily blocked with snow and then the mountains of the with their loads had to be let down over the and beds by means of ropes a good bridle path leads from through many a grove and meadow up to the head of the a distance of about thirty miles here the scenery a sudden and startling mountains red gray and black rise close at hand on the right around their with banks of enduring snow on the left the huge red mass of mount while in front the eye s down the shadowy and out on the warm plain of where the lake is seen gleaming like a with clusters of lofty to the south of it when at length we enter the mountain the rocks seem aware of our presence and seem to come closer about us happily the and the old familiar robin are here to sing us welcome and beam with and sympathy us to feel something of e s love even here beneath the gaze of her rocks the effect of this expressive on the part of the rocks is gi by the quiet aspect of the meadows through which we pass just before entering the narrow the forests in which they lie and the mountain tops rising beyond them seem quiet and tranquil we catch their spirit yield to the soothing influences of the sunshine and on through flowers and bees scarce touched by a definite thought then suddenly we the passes find ourselves in the shadowy with nature in one of her wildest after the first bewildering impression begins to wear off we perceive that it is not altogether terrible for besides the birds and flowers we discover a chain of shining hanging down from the very summit of the pass and linked together by a silvery stream the highest are set in bleak rough fringed with brown and yellow winter blow snow through the in blinding and shoot from the heights then are these sparkling filled and buried leaving not a hint of their existence in june and july they begin to and out like sleepy eyes the thrust up their short brown the bloom in turn and the most profoundly buried of them all is at length warmed and as if winter were only a dream red lake is the lowest of the chain and also the largest it seems rather dull and forbidding at first sight lying motionless in its deep dark bed the wall rises sheer from the water s edge on the south but on the opposite side there is sufficient space and sunshine for a garden the of which is brilliantly lighted with lilies and sheltered from the wind by leafy and a most joyful outburst of plant life keenly by the chill of the cliffs after here in a lake rest the happy stream sets forth again the mountains of ling and like an ever delightfully confiding no matter how dark the way leaping gliding hither thither clear or foaming the beauty of its in every sound and gesture one of its most beautiful is the diamond situated a short distance below red lake here the tense water is first dashed into coarse spray mixed with dusty foam and then divided into a diamond pattern by following the joints that the face of the precipice over which it viewed in front it a strip of of definite pattern varying through the seasons with the temperature and the volume of water scarce a flower may be seen along its snowy border a few bent pines look on from a distance and small of and are growing in near the head but these are so lowly and that only the attentive observer will be likely to notice them on the north wall of the a little below the diamond a glittering side stream makes its appearance seeming to leap directly out of the sky it first a ribbon of silver hanging loosely down the wall but grows wider as it and the dull rock with foam a long rough cm up against this part of the overgrown with snow pressed in which the fall with many an eager and and

groups that make beautiful and obvious harmony with the rocks and with one another blooming becomes abundant â and the rose weaving for the streams and shaggy to relieve the stern rock through this delightful wilderness creek without any channel throbbing and wavering now in sunshine now in thoughtful shade falling flashing from side to side in of energy a glorious way of is thus developed of which bower though one of the smallest is perhaps the most beautiful of them all it is situated in the lower region of the pass just where the sunshine begins 
75,to mellow between the cold and warm here the glad creek grown strong with tribute gathered from many a snowy fountain on the mountains of the heights sings richer strains and becomes more and at eveiy step now you may by its side find the rose and homely and small meadows full of bees and at the head of a low rock luxuriant bushes and arch over from bank to bank the stream with their leafy

corresponding beauty from the stream in passing over it â bright of notes of falls solemn of smooth gliding sheets all and in glorious harmony when at length its impetuous life is done it slips

blessed stream rests from its rocky wanderings all its done â no more foaming rock leaping no more wild song it falls into a smooth sleep stirred only by the night wind which coming down the makes the passes it and in along its shores leaving the lake it quietly through the rushes destined never more to touch the living rock henceforth its path lies through ancient and reaches of sage plain which nowhere afford rocks suitable for the development of or sheer falls yet this beauty of maturity though less striking is of a still higher order us lovingly on through meadows and groves of rustling to lake where spirit like our happy stream in and free again in the sky bloody like every other in the was recently occupied by a which derived its fountain from the adjacent and descended into lake at a time when its waters stood at a much higher level than now the principal characters in which the history of the ancient is preserved are displayed here in freshness and simplicity furnishing the student with extraordinary advantages for the acquisition of knowledge of this sort the most striking passages are polished and which in many places reflect the rays of the sun like smooth water the dam of lake is an of slate brought into relief because of its superior strength and because of the greater intensity of the of the rock immediately above it caused by a inclined which entered the main trunk with a heavy down thrust at the head of the lake the mountains of lake an interesting example of a basin formed wholly or in part by a dam curved across the path of a stream between two at lake the proper although apparently continued by the two of the vanished these are about feet high and extend from the sides of the into the plain a distance of about five miles and in beautiful lines their sides are gardens their shady sides are groves the former devoted chiefly to and a square rod containing five or six of several species about the same number of and and a few grass each species being planted apart with bare gravel between as if cultivated my first visit to bloody was made in the summer of under circumstances well calculated to the impressions that are the peculiar offspring of mountains i came from the blooming of and out into the plant gold of the great valley of when its was as yet never before had i beheld of social flowers half so extensive or half so glorious golden covered all the ground from the coast to the like a of sunshine in which i for weeks watching the rising and setting of their innumerable then i gave up to be borne forward on the crest of the summer wave that sweeps up the and itself on the snowy the passes at the big meadows i remained more than a month and climbing among the surrounding mountains the with whom i then happened to be was one of those remarkable men one so frequently meets in the hard angles and of whose characters have been brought into relief by the grinding of the gold period until they resemble but at this late day my friend s had subsided and his craving for rest caused him to become a gentle shepherd and literally to lie down with the lamb the of my scotch instincts he threw out some hints concerning bloody and advised me to explore it i have never seen it he said for i never was so unfortunate as to pass that way but i have heard many a strange story about it and i warrant you will at least find it wild enough then of course i made haste to see it early next morning i made up a bundle of bread tied my note book to my belt and strode away in the air full of eager indefinite hope the that lay in my path served to soothe my morning haste the sod in many places was with and blue over which i lingered i traced the paths of the ancient over many a shining pavement and marked the in the upper forests that told the power of the winter climbing higher i saw for the first time the gradual of the pines in compliance with climate and on the summit discovered creeping of the willow overgrown with the mountains of and patches of the dwarf with its round flowers sprinkled in the grass like purple hail while in eveiy direction the landscape 
76,stretched away in fresh â a manuscript written by the hand of nature alone at length as i entered the pass the huge rocks began to close around in all their wild mysterious when suddenly as i was gazing eagerly about me a drove of gi ay hairy beings came in sight toward me with a kind of motion like bears i never turn back though often so inclined and in this particular instance amid such surroundings everything seemed singularly for the calm acceptance of so grim a company my fears i soon discovered that although as as bears and as crooked as summit pines the strange creatures were sufficiently erect to belong to our own species they proved to be nothing more formidable than indians dressed in the skins of sage both the men and the women begged persistently for and tobacco and seemed so accustomed to that i found it impossible to convince them that i had none to give excepting the names of these two of civilization they seemed to understand not a word of english but i afterward learned that they were on then way to valley to feast awhile on and procure a load of to carry back through the pass to their huts on the shore of lake occasionally a good countenance may be seen among the indians but these the first the passes i had seen were mostly ugly and some of them altogether hideous the dirt on their faces was fairly and seemed so ancient and so undisturbed it might almost possess a significance the older faces were moreover strangely and divided into sections by that looked like the joints of rocks suggesting exposure on the mountains in a condition for ages somehow they seemed to have no right place in the landscape and i was glad to see them fading out of sight down the pass then came evening and the cliffs were inspired with the beauty of the a solemn calm fell upon everything all the lower portion of the was in shadow and i crept into a hollow near one of the upper to smooth the ground in a sheltered nook for a bed when the short twilight faded i kindled a sunny fire made a cup of tea and lay down to rest and look at the stars soon the night wind began to flow and pour in torrents among the jagged peaks mingling strange tones with those of the sounding far below and as i drifted toward sleep i began to experience an uncomfortable feeling of to the then the full moon looked down over the edge of the wall her countenance seemingly filled with intense concern and apparently so near as to produce a startling effect as if she had entered my bedroom forgetting all the world to gaze on me alone the night was full of strange sounds and i gladly welcomed the morning breakfast was soon done and i set forth in the freshness the mountains of of the new day rejoicing in the abundance of pure so close about me the rocks and with centuries of storms stood sharply out in the thin early light while down in the bottom of the and polished heaved and like swelling sea waves telling a grand old story of the ancient that poured its crushing floods above them here for the first time i met the in all their perfection of purity and â gentle face to face with the stormy sky kept safe and warm by a thousand miracles i leaped lightly from rock to rock in the eternal freshness and of nature and in the tenderness with which she her mountain in the very fountains of storms fresh beauty appeared at every step delicate rock and groups of the fairest flowers now another lake came to view now a never fell light in brighter never fell water in foam i seemed to float through the enchanted feeling nothing of its and was out in the before i was aware looking back from the shore of lake my morning seemed all a dream there curved bloody a mere feet deep with smooth rocks projecting from the sides and together in the middle like swelling muscles here the lilies were higher than my head and the sunshine was warm enough for palms yet the snow around the was plainly visible only four miles away and be the passes were narrow specimen of all the j of the globe on the bank of a small brook that comes down the side of the left i a camp fire still burning which no doubt belonged to the gray indians i had met on the summit and i listened instinctively and moved cautiously forward half expecting to see some of their grim faces peering out of the bushes passing on toward the open plain i noticed three well defined curved gi across the stream and joined by long to the two noble these mark the of the vanished when it was retreating into its summit shadows on the breaking up of the winter five miles below the foot of lake just where the lose themselves in the plain there was a field of wild growing in magnificent waving six to eight feet high bearing heads from six to twelve inches long rubbing out some of the i found them about five of an inch long dark colored and sweet indian women were gathering it in baskets bending down large beating it out and it in the wind they were quite picturesque coming through the as one caught glimpses of them here and there in winding lanes and with splendid above their heads while their incessant chat and laughter showed their heedless joy like the field i found the so called desert of blooming in a high state of natural the mountains of with the wild rose and the delicate also innumerable and bush i observed then gestures and the 
76,various expressions of their inquiring how they could be so fresh and beautiful out in this desert they told as happy a life as any plant company i ever met and seemed to enjoy even the hot sand and the wind but the vegetation of the pass has been in great part destroyed and the same may be said of all the more accessible passes throughout the range immense numbers of starving sheep and cattle have been driven thi them into the wild gardens and meadows almost out of existence the lofty walls are untouched by any foot and the falls sing on unchanged but the sight of crushed flowers and stripped bitten bushes goes far toward destroying the of the should be seen in winter a good strong who knows the way and the weather might easily make a safe excursion through it from valley on snow shoes during some tranquil time when the storms are hushed the lakes and falls would be buried then but so also would be the traces of destructive feet while the views of the mountains in their winter garb and the ride at lightning speed down the pass between the snowy walls would be glorious f i i chapter vi the lakes among the many for treasures that j are bound up and hidden away in the depths of none more surely charm and surprise all kinds of than the lakes the forests and the and the snowy fountains of the streams their wealth in a more or less telling manner even in the distance but nothing is seen of the lakes until we have climbed above them all the upper branches of the rivers are fairly laden with lakes like orchard trees with fruit they lie in the deep woods down in the of high on bald and around the feet of the icy peaks back their wild beauty over and over again some conception of their lavish abundance may be made from the fact that from one on the summit of mountain a day s journey to the east of valley no fewer than forty two are displayed within a of ten miles the whole number in the can hardly be less than fifteen hundred not counting the smaller pools and which are innumerable perhaps two thirds or more lie on the western flank of the range and all are to the and the lakes regions at the close of the last period the middle and foot hill regions also in lakes all of which have long since vanished as completely as the magnificent ancient that brought them into existence though the eastern flank of the range is excessively steep we find lakes pretty regularly distributed throughout even the most portions they are mostly found in the upper branches of the and in the around the peaks occasionally long narrow specimens occur upon the steep sides of dividing their swung like and very rarely one is found lying so exactly on the summit of the range at the head of some pass that its waters are discharged down both when the snow is melting fast but however situated they soon cease to form surprises to the for like all the love work of e they are related to one another and to all the other features of the mountains it is easy therefore to find the bright lake eyes in the and most looking of any landscape countenance even in the lower regions where they have been closed for many a century their rocky are still filled in with the of and a beautiful system of in correspondence with the fountains is soon perceived also their extension in the direction of the of the ancient and in general their dependence as to form size and position upon the character of the rocks in which the mountains of their have been and the quantity and du of application of the force expended upon each basin in the upper we usually find them in pretty regular succession strung together uke beads on the bright ribbons of their which pour white and gray with foam and spray from one to the other their perfect mirror stillness making impressive with the grand and glare of the connecting in lake hollow on the north side of the immediately above the great there are ten lovely lying near together in one general like eggs in a nest seen from above in a general view with and fringed with they seem to me the most singularly beautiful and lake cluster i have ever yet discovered lake miles long by about wide and from to over feet in depth is the largest of all the lakes it lies just beyond the northern limit of the higher portion of the range between the main and a spur that puts out on the east side from near the head of the river its shores go cm in and out around many an bay and pine crowned and its waters are everywhere as keenly pure as any to be found among the highest mountains lake rendered memorable by the terrible fate of the party is about three miles long and lies about ten miles to the north of at the head of one of the of the a few miles farther north lies lake independence the lakes about the same size as but far the greater number of the lakes lie much higher and are quite small few of them exceeding a mile in length most of them less than half a mile along the lower edge of the lake belt the smallest have disappeared by the in of their leaving only those of considerable size but all along the upper margin of the lake bearing every hollow however small lying within reach of any portion of the close of streams contains a bright pool so that the landscape viewed from the seems to be sown with them many of the larger 
76,lakes are encircled with smaller ones like central gems with sparkling in general however there is no marked dividing line as to size in order therefore to prevent confusion i would state here that in giving numbers i include none less than yards in in the basin of the river i counted of which are upon the that fall so into valley creek which forms the fall of that name takes its rise in a beautiful lake lying beneath the shadow of a lofty granite spur that puts out from vista peak this is now the only lake left in the whole basin the has sixteen the no fewer than sixty seven the eight creek five and creek fourteen there are but two other lake bearing of the the south fork with fifteen and creek with five both of which unite with the main trunk below i e k ad s of m i as a whole is remarkably like ii au i it bat little effort on the â ib r to picture it standing up â ti lakes hanging npon its spreading i t j mo i eighty miles in height now d i late rivers of the h in it j v and yoa will have a truly glorious j rt ta le â an the length and width of the l ee the range the long slender gray shafts of the main trunks the way of branches and the silvery lakes all clearly defined and shining on the sky how excitedly such an addition to the scenery would be gazed at yet these ul the lakes ers are still more beautiful and impressive in natural positions to those who have the eyes to see them as they lie in their meadows and forests and rocks when a mountain lake is born â when like a young eye it first opens to the light â it is an irregular in banks of rock and ice â bare rock on the lower side the rugged of a on the upper in this condition it remains for many a year until at toward the end of some cluster of seasons the beyond the upper margin of the basin leaving it open from shore to shore for the first time thousands of years after its conception beneath the that its basin the landscape cold and bare is reflected in its pure depths the winds its surface and the sun fills it with throbbing while its waves begin to lap and murmur around its shores â sun during the day and reflected stars at night its only flowers the winds and the snow its only visitors meanwhile the continues to and numerous still younger than the lake itself bring down sand and pebbles giving rise to and of soil to these fresh soil beds come many a waiting plant first a hardy with leaves and a of brown flowers then as the seasons grow warmer and the soil beds deeper and wider other take their appointed places and these are joined by blue and many a lowly moss shrubs also hasten in time to the new the mountains op gardens â with its glossy leaves and purple flowers the willow making soft woven carpets together with the and the fairest and dearest of them all insects now the air pipe cheerily in the soon followed by the which is the first bird to visit a lake as the is the first of plants so the young lake grows in beauty becoming more and more from century to century groves of spring up and hardy pines and the it is richly and but while its shores are enriched the soil beds creep out with incessant growth its area while the lighter mud deposited on the bottom cause it to gi ow constantly until at length the last remnant of the lake â closed forever in ripe and natural old age and now its feeding stream goes winding on without halting through the new gardens and groves that have taken its place the length of the life of any lake depends ordinarily upon the capacity of its basin as compared with the carrying power of the streams that flow into it the character of the rocks over which these streams flow and the relative position of the lake toward other lakes in a series whose lie in the same and are fed by one and the same main stream the uppermost will of course vanish first unless some other lake filling agent comes in to the result because at first it receives nearly all of the that the stream brings the s down only the finest of the mud being carried through the highest of the series to the next below then the next higher and the next would be filled and the lowest would be the last to vanish but this simplicity as to duration is broken in upon in various ways through the action of side streams that enter the lower lakes direct for notwithstanding many of these side are quite short and during late summer feeble they all become powerful torrents in when the snow is melting and carry not only sand and pine needles but large trunks and tons in weight sweeping them down their inclined channels and into the lake with energy many of these side also have the advantage of access to the main of the vanished that occupied the and upon these they draw for lake filling material while the main trunk stream flows mostly over clean where but little matter is ever left for them to carry thus a small rapid stream with abundance of loose material within its reach may fill up an extensive basin in a few centuries while a large trunk stream flowing over clean enduring though ordinarily a hundred times larger may not fill a smaller basin in thousands of years the comparative influence of gi eat and small streams as 
76,lake is strikingly illustrated in valley through which the flows the bottom of the valley is now composed of level meadow lands and sloping soil beds planted the mountains op with oak and pine but it was once a lake stretching from wall to wall and nearly from one end of the valley to the other forming one of the most beautiful bound sheets of water that ever existed in the and though never perhaps seen by human eye it was but yesterday speaking since it disappeared and the traces of its existence are still so fresh it may easily be restored to the eye of imagination and viewed in all its grandeur about as truly and vividly as if actually before us now we find that the which fills this magnificent basin was not brought down from the distant mountains by the main streams that here to form the river however powerful and available for the purpose at first sight they appear but almost wholly by the small local such as those of indian the and the three brothers and by a few small which lingered in the shadows of the walls long after the main trunk had beyond the head of the valley had the that once covered the range been melted at once leaving the entire surface bare from top to bottom simultaneously then of course all the lakes would have come into existence at the same time and the highest other circumstances being equal would as we have seen be the first to vanish but because they melted gradually from the foot of the range upward the lower lakes were the first to see the light and the first to be therefore instead of finding the lakes of the present day at the foot of the range we find them at the top most of the lower lakes van the lakes thousands of years before those now brightening the bom and in general owing to the of the upward the th of a i retreat of the the lowest of the existing lakes are also the t a gradual being apparent throughout the entire belt from the older meadow and contracted forms all the mountains of the way up to those that are new born lying bare and among the highest peaks a few small lakes unfortunately situated are extinguished suddenly by a single of an carrying down immense numbers of trees together with the soil they were growing upon others are by land slips earthquake etc but these lake deaths compared with those from the deliberate and incessant of may be termed accidental their fate is like that of trees struck by lightning the lake is of course still rising its present elevation being about feet above sea level somewhat higher than this toward the southern extremity of the range lower toward the northern on account of the difference in time of the of the due to difference in climate specimens occur here and there considerably below this in specially protected from or exceptional in size these however are not sufficiently numerous to make any marked in the line the highest i have yet found lies at an elevation of about feet in a at the foot of one of the highest of the summit peaks a few miles to the north of mount bitter the of perhaps twenty five or thirty are still in process of formation beneath the few lingering but by the time they are born an equal or greater number will probably have died since the beginning of the close of the ice period the whole number in the range has perhaps never been greater than at present a rough to the average duration the lakes of these mountain lakes may be made from already suggested but i cannot stop here to present the subject in detail i must also forego in the mean time the pleasure of a full discussion of the interesting question of lake basin formation for which fine clear material in these mountains in addition to what has been already given on the subject i will only make this one statement every lake in the is a lake their were not merely and out by this mighty agent but in the first place were from the solid i must now make haste to give some nearer views of representative specimens lying at different on the main lake belt myself to descriptions of the features most characteristic of each shadow lake this is a fine specimen of the oldest and lowest of the existing lakes it lies about eight miles above valley on the main branch of the at an elevation of about feet above the sea and is everywhere so securely cliff bound that without artificial only wild animals can get down to its rocky shores from any direction its original length was about a mile and a now it is only half a mile in length by about a fourth of a mile in width and over the lowest portion of the basin ninety eight feet deep its crystal waters are clasped around on the north and south by majestic granite walls in true style into the mountains of and which on the south come plunging down sheer into deep water from a height of from to feet the south this magnificent basin out of solid granite while forcing its way westward from the summit fountains toward and the exposed rocks around the shores and the projecting of the walls ground and beneath the vast ice flood still glow with silvery radiance notwithstanding the innumerable storms that have fallen upon them the general of the basin as well as the laid along the top of the walls and the and on the bottom and sides indicate in the most unmistakable manner the direction pursued by this mighty ice river its great depth and the tremendous energy it exerted in thrusting itself into and out of the 
77,basin bearing down with superior pressure upon this portion of its channel because of the greater consequently it deeper than the other portions about it and producing the lake bowl as the necessary result with these magnificent ice characters so vividly before us it is not easy to realize that the old that made them vanished of centuries ago for excepting the vegetation that has sprung up and the changes effected by an earthquake that hurled rock from the weaker the basin as a whole presents the same appearance that it did when first brought to light the lake itself however has undergone marked changes one sees at a glance that it is growing old more the lakes than two thirds of its original area is now dry land covered with meadow and groves of pine and fir and the level bed of stretching across from wall to wall at the head is evidently growing out all along its margin and will at length close the lake forever every lover of fine would delight to on a summer day through the groves now occupying the filled up portion of the basin the shore is clearly traced by a ribbon of white sand upon which the play then comes a belt of broad interrupted here and there by impenetrable of beyond this there are groves of trembling then a dark shadowy belt of two pine with here and there a round meadow nest like in its midst and lastly a narrow outer margin of majestic silver fir feet high the ground beneath the trees is covered with a luxuriant crop of chiefly and with purple and to one s shoulders while the open meadow patches glow throughout the summer with flowers â and lilies and form favorite hiding and feeding grounds for bears and deer the rugged south wall is darkly along the top with an imposing array of silver while the all the way down to the water s edge are adorned with picturesque old their colored bark showing finely upon the gray of the granite these with a few dwarf pines and lean the mountains of out over ribs and or stand erect back in shadowy in an wild and fearless manner moreover the white and dwarf oak form graceful along the wherever the slightest hold can be effected rock too are here such as and making handsome on the and the delicate and hide back in by some and then the orange wall flower holds up its here and there in the sunshine and makes of gold but notwithstanding all this plant beauty the general impression in looking across the lake is of stem the and flowers are scarcely seen and not one of the whole surface is with plant life the north wall is more varied in but the general tone is the same a few flat and soil covered support of and pine and up of and live oak growing on rough earthquake their small streams come down between them their foaming brightened with gay and and close along the shore on this side there is a strip of rocky meadow with and white and the out on its border dip their leaves into the water the lower edge of the basin is a dam like of solid granite heavily by the old the lakes but scarce at all cut into as yet by the stream though it has flowed on since the lake came into existence as soon as the stream is fairly over the lake lip it breaks into never for a moment halting and scarce one of its glad energy until it reaches the next up basin a mile below then and through meadow and grove it breaks forth anew into gray and falls leaping and gliding in glorious of wild bound and dance down into another and yet another filled up lake basin then after a long rest in the of little it makes its display in the famous fall out of the clouds of spray at the foot of the fall the battered roaring river its way makes another mile of and rests a moment in pool then over the grand cliff of the fall and goes thundering and down a choked of tremendous depth and into the tranquil reaches of the old lake basin the color beauty about shadow lake during the indian summer is much richer than one could hope to find in so young and so a wilderness almost every leaf is tinted then and the are in bloom but most of the color is given by the ripe and at the foot of the lake you stand in a trembling grove every leaf painted like a butterfly and away to right and left round the shores sweeps a ribbon of meadow red and brown dotted with pale yellow off here and there into the mountains of purple the walls too are dashed with bits of bright color that gleam out on the granite gray but neither the walls nor the margin meadow nor yet the gay grove in which you stand nor the lake itself flashing with can long hold your attention for at the head of the lake there is a gorgeous mass of orange yellow belonging to the main belt of the basin which seems the veiy fountain whence all the color below it had flowed and here your eye is filled and fixed this glorious mass is about thirty feet high and extends across the basin nearly from wall to wall rich of willow flame in front of it and from the base of these the brown meadow comes forward to the water s edge the whole being relieved against the green of the while thick sun gold is poured over all during these blessed color days no cloud the sky the winds are gentle and the landscape rests hushed everywhere and impressive a few ducks are usually seen sailing on the lake apparently 
77,more for pleasure than anything else and the at the head of the sing always while and the are busy in the groves making delightful company and the feeling of grateful without the deep hushed calm and peace this usually lasts until the end of november then come days of quite another kind the winter clouds grow and bloom and shed their on every leaf and rock and all the colors vanish like a sunset the deer gather the lakes and hasten down well known fearful of being snow bound storm storm snow on the cliffs and meadows and bending the slender pines to the ground in wide arches one over the other and like lodged wheat rush and boom from the heights immense heaps upon the frozen lake and all the summer glory is buried and lost yet in the midst of this hearty winter the sun shines warm at times calling the to in the snowy pines and seek out his hidden stores and the weather is never so severe as to drive away the gi and little nut and toward may the lake begins to open the hot sun sends down innumerable streams over the cliffs them round and round with foam the snow slowly and the meadows show of green then spring comes on flowers and flies the air and the sod and the deer come back to the upper groves like birds to an old nest i first discovered this charming lake in the autumn of while on my way to the at the head of the river it was rejoicing then in its colors hidden in the glorious like gold year after year i walked its shores without discovering any other trace of humanity than the remains of an indian camp fire and the bones of a deer that had been broken to get at the it lies out of the regular ways of indians who love to hunt in more accessible fields adjacent to their knowledge of deer haunts had probably them here some the mountains of hunger time when they wished to make sure of a feast for hunting in this lake hollow is like hunting in a park i had told the beauty of shadow lake only to a few friends fearing it might come to be trampled and improved like on my last visit as i was along the shore on the strip of sand between the water and sod reading the tracks of the wild animals that live here i was startled by a human track which i at once saw belonged to some shepherd for each step was turned out â or â from the general course pursued and was also run over in an uncertain fashion at the heel while a row of round on the right indicated the staff that carry none but a shepherd could make such a track and after tracing it a few minutes i began to fear that he might be seeking for what else could he be seeking returning from the shortly afterward my worst fears were realized a trail had been made down the mountain side from the north and all the gardens and meadows were destroyed by a of as if swept by a fire the money were in the temple orange lake besides these larger lakes fed by the main streams there are many smaller ones lying aloft on the top of rock benches entirely independent of the general channels and of course drawing their supplies from a very limited the lakes area notwithstanding they are mostly small and shallow owing to their from and the of powerful streams they often endure longer than others many times larger but less situated when very shallow they become dry toward the end of summer but because their are ground out of stone they suffer no loss save from alone and the great depth of snow that falls lasting into june makes their dry season short in any case orange lake is a fair illustration of this bench form it lies in the middle of a beautiful pavement near the lower margin of the lake line about a mile and a half to the of shadow lake it is only about yards in next the water there is a of with wide leaves then in regular order a shaggy of bushes a of with here and there a bush of the mountain ash then a of with a few pines around the outside these are of course and together form a wall beyond which the naked granite stretches away in every direction leaving it relieved like a bunch of palms in a desert in autumn when the colors are ripe the whole circular grove at a little distance looks like a big handful of flowers set in a cup to be kept fresh â a of its feeding streams are exceedingly beautiful notwithstanding their and extreme they have no channel whatever and consequently are left free to spread in thin sheets upon the shining granite the mountains of and wander at will in many places the current is less than a fourth of an inch deep and flows with so little it is scarcely visible sometimes there is not a single foam bell or drifting or of any sort to manifest its motion yet when narrowly it is seen to form a web of gliding exquisitely woven giving beautiful reflections from its minute and and from the of large in being everywhere transparent in spring when the snow is melting the lake bowl is full and sends forth quite a large stream that slips for yards or so until it comes to an almost precipice feet high down which it in a fine then it its scattered waters and goes smoothly over folds of gently dipping granite to its with the main stream during the greater portion of the year however not a single water sound will you hear either at 
77,head or foot of the lake not even the whispered of ripple waves along the shore for the winds are out but the deep mountain silence is now and then by birds that stop here to rest and drink on their way across the lake king a beautiful variety of the bench top lakes occurs just where the great of the main have been forward in rings by small the mountains of instead of being by a narrow ring of trees like orange lake these lie in dense woods so dense that in seeking them you may pass them by again and again although you may know nearly where they lie concealed lake king lying to the north of the of that name above the little valley is a fine specimen of this variety the pass it by and so do the ducks they could hardly get into it if they would without straight down inside the trees yet these isolated gems lying like fallen fruit detached from the branches are not altogether without inhabitants and joyous visitors of course fishes cannot get into them and this is generally true of nearly every lake in the range but they are all well with happy how did the get into them in the first place perhaps their was carried in on the feet of ducks or other birds else their must have made some exciting excursions through the woods and up the sides of the down in the still pure depths of these hidden you may also find the of innumerable insects and a great variety of while the air above them is thick with humming wings through the midst of which fly are constantly darting and in autumn when the are ripe bands of and come to feast forming altogether delightful little for the pushing our way upward toward the of the range we find lakes in greater and greater abundance and more youthful in aspect at an the lakes tion of about feet above sea level they seem to have arrived at middle age â that is their seem to be about half filled with broad sheets of meadow land are seen extending into them imperfect and in many places and more nearly level than those of the older lakes below them and the vegetation of their shores is of course more and fringe the meadow rocks while the luxuriant waving groves so characteristic of the lower lakes are represented only by of the dwarf pine and these however are very on rocky around the outer rim of the meadows or with still more striking effect crown some rocky moreover from causes that we cannot stop here to explain the cliffs about these middle aged lakes are seldom of the massive type but are more broken and less sheer and they usually stand back leaving the shores comparatively free while the few rocks that do come forward and plunge directly into deep water are seldom more than three or four hundred feet high i have never yet met ducks in any of the lakes of this kind but the is never wanting where the feeding streams are wild sheep and deer may occasionally be seen on the meadows and very rarely a bear one might camp on the rugged shores of these bright fountains for weeks without meeting any animal larger than the that beneath along the edges of the meadows the highest and youngest of all the lakes lie the mountains of in at first sight they seem es of e desolation miniature seas bound in perpetual ice and snow and by harsh gloomy crumbling their waters are keen blue in the deepest parts lively grass green toward the shore and around the edges of the small usually floating about in them a few hardy frost pinched every night are occasionally found making soft along the sun touched portions of their shores and when their northern banks slope openly to the south and are soil covered no matter how they are sure to be brightened with flowers one lake in particular now comes to mind which the of the banks of these icy gems close up under the shadow of the on the eastern slope of the range lies one of the of these lakes at an elevation of about feet a short ragged edged into it from the south and on the opposite side it is and by a series of made by the when it entirely filled the basin half a mile below lies a second lake at a height of feet about as cold and as pure as a snow crystal the waters of the first come down into it over and through the dam while a second stream into it direct from a that lies to the sheer of snow rise out of deep water on the south keeping perpetual winter on that side but there is a fine spot on the other notwithstanding the lake is only about yards the lakes wide here on august found a charming company of flowers not pinched crouching scarce able to look up but warm and standing erect in rich cheery color and bloom on a narrow strip of close to the water s edge there were a few of gone to seed and a little way back up the rocky bank at the foot of a crumbling wall so inclined as to and as well as reflect a considerable quantity of sun heat was the garden containing a thicket of covered with large yellow flowers several bushes of the with nearly ripe and wildly a few handsome belonging to two distinct species and one a few hairy and radiant whose blue and rose colored flowers were set off to fine advantage amid green and along a narrow in the very warmest angle of the wall a perfectly gorgeous fringe of with flowers an inch wide crowded together in lavish profusion and colored as royal a as 
77,ever was worn by any high bred plant of the and best of all and gi of all a noble in full bloom standing erect head and shoulders above his companions and thrusting out his in sturdy vigor as if growing on a all this brave warm bloom among the raw stones right in the face of the as far as i have been able to find out these upper lakes are snow buried in winter to a depth of about thirty five or forty feet and those most exposed to to a depth of even a hundred feet or more these last are of course nearly lost to the the mountains of landscape some remain buried for years when the is great and many open only on one side late in the season the snow of the closed side is composed of coarse and frozen into a firm faintly mass like the of a the waves of the open portion gradually and cause it to break off in large masses like which gives rise to a front like the wall of a entering the sea the play of the lights among the crystal angles of these snow cliffs the white of the the drifting in front in the sun and edged with green water and the deep blue of the lake itself extending to your feet â this forms a picture that all your and is never forgotten but however perfect the season and the day the cold of these young lakes is always keenly felt we approach them with a kind of mean caution and steal around their crystal shores dashed and ill at ease as if expecting to hear some forbidding voice but the of the and the love looks of the gradually us and manifest the warm fountain humanity that the and most solitary of them all chapter vn the meadows after the lakes on the come the jl meadows they are smooth level lying in the upper forests on the floors of the valleys and along the broad backs of the main dividing at a height of about to feet above the sea they are nearly as level as the lakes whose places they have taken and present a dry even surface free from rock heaps and the of rank coarse and vegetation the sod is close and fine and so complete that you cannot see the gi and at the same time so brightly with flowers and that it may well be called a or meadow garden for the sod is in many places so crowded with and various species of that the grass is scarcely noticeable while in others the flowers are only pricked in here and there singly or in small ornamental the most influential of the the sod is a delicate with fine leaves and loose airy that seem to float above the lawn like a purple mist but the mountains op write as i may i cannot give anything like an adequate idea of the exquisite beauty of these mountain carpets as they he smoothly in the savage wilderness what words are j ne enough to picture them to what shall we them the of the of the old west the luxuriant of the south and the finest of cultivated meadows are coarse in comparison one may at first sight compare them with the carefully tended of pleasure grounds for they are as free from weeds as they and as smooth but here the likeness ends for these wild with all their exquisite have no trace of that painful licked repressed appearance that pleasure ground are apt to have even when viewed at a distance and not to mention the flowers with which they are brightened their are very much finer both in color and texture and instead of lying flat and motionless together like a dead green cloth they respond to the touches of every breeze rejoicing in pure blooming and in the vital light meadows abound throughout all the and regions of the in still greater numbers than the lakes probably from to exist between latitude â and â distributed of course like the lakes in with all the other features of the landscape on the head waters of the rivers there are what are called big meadows usually about from five to ten miles long these occupy the of the ancient ice seas where many came together to form the grand trunks most however the meadows are quite small perhaps but little more than three of a mile in length one of the very finest of the thousands i have enjoyed lies hidden in an extensive forest of the pine on the edge of the basin of the ancient de about eight miles to the west of mount imagine at the springs on the bank of the river a day s above valley you set off northward through a forest that stretches away before you seemingly unbroken by of any kind as soon as you are fairly into the woods the gi ay mountain peaks with their snowy and hollows are lost to view the ground is with fallen trunks that lie crossed and like storm lodged wheat and besides this close forest of pines the rich soil a luxuriant growth of ribbon â etc which rear their handsome and above waist making your way through the fertile wilderness â finding lively bits of interest now and then in the and and perchance in a deer or bear â after the lapse of an hour or two bars of sunshine are seen ahead between the brown shafts of the pines showing that you are approaching an open space and then you suddenly from the forest shadows upon a delightful purple lawn lying smooth and free in the light like a lake this is a meadow it is about a mile and a long by a quarter of a mile wide the trees come pressing forward all around 
78,in close ranks the mountains op planting their feet exactly on its margin and holding themselves erect strict and orderly like soldiers on parade thus bounding the meadow with exquisite precision yet with free cm lines such as e alone can draw with delight you out into the grassy sun lake feeling yourself contained in one of nature s most sacred chambers withdrawn from the influences of the mountains e from all intrusion e from yourself free in the universal beauty and notwithstanding the scene is so spiritual and you seem dissolved in it yet about you is beating with warm human love and life delightfully substantial and familiar the pines are types of health and the feeding on the sod belong to the same species you have known since childhood and surely these and are the very friend flowers of the old home garden bees hum as in a hai noon above the flowers and like them you lave in the vital sunshine too richly and joy filled to be capable of partial thought you are all eye through and through with light and beauty along the brook that silently through the meadow from the east special flowers call you back to consciousness the sod comes cm down to the water s edge forming banks and in some places and forming bridges here you find of the curious dwarf willow scarce an inch high yet sending up a multitude of gray the meadows here and there with the purple cups and bells of and g o where you may you everywhere find the lawn beautiful as if nature had and adjusted every plant this very day the floating grass are scarcely felt in brushing through their midst so fine are they and none of the flowers have tall or rigid in the brightest places you find three species of with different shades of blue pure as the sky with warm yellow flowers several species of with blunt red and purple and yellow the and fragrant and with their colors and blended parting the and looking more closely you may trace the of their shining stems and note the beauty of their mist of flowers the and exquisitely the yellow dangling and beneath the lowest leaves you discover a fairy realm of â and many others â their precious cups poised on polished shafts curiously or open showing the richly worn like royal crowns creeping are here also in abundance and several rare species of exceedingly small and frail and delicate as if made only for beauty black and the of this lower world making their way through miniature groves and like bears in a thick wood and how rich too is the life of the sunny air every leaf and flower seems to have its winged the mountains of representative overhead flies shoot in vigorous through the dancing and a rich profusion of â the of insects â make a fine addition to the general show many of these last are comparatively small at this elevation and as yet almost unknown to science but every now and then a familiar or comes past humming birds too are quite common here and the robin is always found along the margin of the stream or out in the portions of the sod and sometimes the and mountain with their of precious chickens the grassy lake from end to end fly come and go in fitful flights from the tops of dead while swing across from side to side in graceful curves â birds insects and flowers all in their own way telling a deep summer joy the influences of pure nature seem to be so little known as yet that it is generally supposed that complete pleasure of this kind one s very flesh and bones the student for scientific pursuits in which cool judgment and observation are required but the effect is just the opposite instead of producing a dissipated condition the mind is and stimulated and developed like sun fed plants all that we have seen here us to see with vision the fountains among the summit peaks to the east whence flowed the that ground soil for the surrounding forest and down at the foot of the meadow the which formed the dam which gave rise to the lake that occupied this basin before the meadow was made the meadows and around the margin the stones that were back and piled up into a rude wall by the of the lake ice during long and along the sides of the streams the slight hollows of the meadow which mark those portions of the old lake that were the last to vanish i would fain ask my readers to linger awhile in this fertile wilderness to trace its history from its earliest and learn what we may of its wild inhabitants and visitors how happy the birds are all summer and some of them all winter how the drive under the snow and how fine and brave a life the lives here and the deer and bears but knowing well the difference between reading and seeing i will only ask attention to some brief sketches of its varying aspects as they are presented throughout the more marked seasons of the year the summer life we have been lasts with but little until october when the night begin to sting the and the leaves of the creeping heath along the banks of the stream to purple and crimson while the flowers disappear all save the and a few that continue to bloom on until the beginning of snowy winter in still nights the grass and every leaf and stalk are laden with frost through which the morning in splendor each to a precious diamond the colors of the rainbow the brook are across and across with slender of ice the mountains op but both these and the grass are melted before midday and notwithstanding the great elevation of the meadow 
78,the are still warm enough to revive the chilled and call them out to enjoy the late the divine the surrounding forest every evening followed by a crystal night with hosts of lily stars whose size and brilliancy cannot be conceived by those who have never risen above the thus come and go the bright sun days of autumn not a cloud in the sky week after week until near december then comes a sudden change clouds of a peculiar aspect with a slow crawling gait gather and gi ow in the throwing out and becoming gradually darker until every lake like and opening is closed and the whole bent is obscured in equal gloom then comes the snow for the clouds are ripe the meadows of the sky are in bloom and shed their radiant blossoms like an orchard in the spring lightly lightly they lodge in the brown and in the needles of the pines falling hour after hour day after day silently lovingly â all the winds hushed â glancing and hither thither against one another rays in as large as and then the dry and the trees and the stones are all equally again thunder showers occur here during the summer months and impressive it is to watch the coming of the big transparent drops each a small world in itself â one unbroken ocean without islands free through the air like the w through space but still more impressive to me is the coming of the snow flowers â falling s winter â giving bloom to all the gi alike blossom brilliantly in the rainbow and change to flowers in the sod but snow comes in full flower direct from the dark frozen sky the later snow storms are a by winds that break up the when the temperature is low into single and dusty fragments but there is comparatively little drifting on the meadow so securely is it in the woods from december to may storm storm until the snow is about fifteen or twenty feet deep but the surface is always as smooth as the breast of a bird hushed now is the life that so late was beating warmly most of the birds have gone down below the snow line the plants sleep and all the fly wings are folded yet the sun beams many a day in casting long lance shadows the dazzling expanse in june small of the dead sod begin to appear gradually and with one another covered with creeping rags of water during the day and ice by night looking as hopeless and as crushed rocks just emerging from the darkness of the period walk the meadow now scarce the memory of a flower will you find the gi seems twice dead nevertheless the annual is drawing near the life giving sun his floods the last snow wreath of growing points push eagerly through the steaming the bu ds come back new wings fill the air the mountains of and summer life comes on seemingly yet more glorious than before this is a perfect meadow and under favorable circumstances exists without any marked changes for centuries nevertheless soon or late it must inevitably grow old and vanish during the calm indian summer scarce a sand grain moves around its banks but in flood times and storm times soil is washed forward upon it and laid in successive sheets around its gently sloping rim and is gi extended to the making it through a considerable period the meadow vegetation is not greatly affected thereby for it gi rises with the rising ground keeping on the surface like water plants rising on the swell of waves but at length the elevation of the goes on so far as to produce too dry a soil for the specific meadow plants when of com se they have to give up their places to others fitted for the new conditions the most characteristic of the at this elevation above the sea are principally sun loving and and finally forest trees the changes are so manifold that the original can be and seen only by the generally speaking lakes vanish more slowly than the meadows that succeed them because unless very shallow a greater quantity of material is required to fill up their and them than is required to render the surface of the meadow too high and dry for meadow vegetation the meadows owing to the to which the adjacent rocks are subjected material of the finer sort susceptible of by rains and ordinary floods is more abundant during the meadow period than during the lake period yet doubtless many a fine meadow situated exists in almost prime beauty for thousands of years the process of being exceedingly slow as we reckon time this is especially the case with meadows like the one we have described â in deep woods with the ground rising gently away from it all around the of tree roots in which all the ground is clasped preventing any rapid washing but in exceptional cases beautiful formed with great deliberation are overwhelmed and at once by the action of land slips earthquake or extraordinary floods just as lakes are in those meadows that take the places of shallow lakes which have been fed by feeble streams mud and fine vegetable enter largely into the composition of the soil and on account of the of this soil and the condition of the rock they are usually wet and therefore occupied by tall and whose coarse appearance offers a striking contrast to that of the delicate lawn making kind described above these shallow soiled meadows are still further and by partially buried and swelling of the bed rock which with the trees and shrubs growing upon them produce a striking effect the mountains of as they stand in relief like islands in the grassy level or sweep across in rugged curves from one forest wall to the other throughout the upper 
78,meadow region wherever water is abundant and low in temperature in secure from flood washing handsome are formed with a deep growth of brown and yellow ruffled with patches of and which masses of beautiful color in the autumn between these cool and the dry meadows there are many interesting varieties which are into one another by the varied conditions already alluded to forming a series of delightful studies hanging meadows another very well marked and interesting kind of meadow greatly both in origin and appearance from the lake meadows is found lying upon covered in the direction of greatest waving up and down over rock heaps and like rich green ribbons brilliantly with tall flowers they occur both in the and regions in considerable numbers and never fail to make telling features in the landscape they are often a mile or more in length but never very wide â usually from thirty to fifty yards when the mountain or side on which they lie at the required angle and other conditions are at the same time favorable they extend from above the the meadows timber line to the bottom of a or lake basin descending in fine lines like breaking here and there into a kind of spray on large or dividing and flowing around on either side of some projecting sometimes a noisy stream goes down through them and again scarcely a drop of water is in sight they owe their existence however to streams whether visible or invisible the wildest specimens being found where some fountain as a or or spring sends down its waters across a rough sheet of soil in a dissipated web of feeble these conditions give rise to a vegetation whose extending roots still more the free flow of the waters and tend to them out over a yet wider area thus the soil and the necessary moisture requisite for the better class of meadow plants are at times combined about as perfectly as if smoothly on a level surface where the sou happens to be composed of the finer qualities of and the water is not in excess the nearest approach is made by the vegetation to that of the lake meadow but where as is more commonly the case the soil is coarse and the vegetation is rank tall wide take their places along the sides and rushes and nodding in the portions mingled with the most beautiful and imposing flowers â orange and seven or eight feet high painted cups many species of and the ample boat and the magnificent the mountains of with spurs an inch and a half long at an elevation of from seven to nine thousand feet flowers frequently form the bulk of the vegetation then the hanging meadows become hanging gardens in rare instances we find an basin the bottom of which is a perfect meadow and the sides nearly all the way round rising in gentle curves are covered with soil which being with melting snow from fountains gives rise to an almost continuous of down meadow vegetation that gracefully into the level meadow at the bottom thus forming a grand smooth soft meadow lined mountain nest it is in meadows of this sort that the mountain loves to make his home snug chambers beneath the sod digging turning the waters from channel to channel to suit his convenience and feeding the vegetation another kind of meadow or occurs on where small streams have been at short intervals by fallen trees still another kind is found hanging down smooth flat while corresponding leaning meadows rise to meet them there are also three kinds of small pot hole meadows one of which is found along the banks of the main streams another on the of rocky and the third on all of them interesting in origin and of plant beauty vm the forests the forests of the are the and most beautiful in the world and grow in a delightful climate on the most interesting and accessible of mountain yet strange to say they are not well known more than sixty years ago david an enthusiastic and tree lover wandered alone through fine sections of the sugar pine and silver fir woods wild with delight a few years later other made short journeys from the coast into the lower woods then came the wonderful multitude of into the foot hill mostly blind with gold dust soon followed by who with wool over their eyes chased their flocks through all the forest from one end of the range to the other then the valley was discovered and thousands of admiring passed through sections of the lower and middle on their way to that wonderful park and gained fine glimpses of the sugar pines and silver along the edges of dusty and roads but few indeed strong and free with eyes with care have gone far enough and lived long enough with the trees to gain anything like a loving conception of their grandeur and the mountains of as manifested in the of their distribution and varying aspects throughout the seasons as they stand arrayed in their winter garb rejoicing in storms putting forth their fresh leaves in the si ring while steaming with fragrance receiving the showers of summer or heavy laden with ripe in the rich of autumn for knowledge of this kind one must dwell with the trees and grow with them without reference to time in the sense the distribution of the general forest in is readily perceived these as we have seen extend in regular order from one of the range to the other and however dense and they may appear in general views neither on the rocky heights nor down in the hollows will you find anything to remind you of the of the and with their l of shade the of the forests of the the â k forest of europe or the dense dark woods of where rolls the 
78,the giant pines and and hold their arms open to the sunlight rising above one another on the mountain benches in glorious array giving forth the utmost expression of gi and beauty with inexhaustible variety and harmony the inviting of the woods is one of their most characteristics the trees of all the species stand more or less apart in gi or in small irregular groups one to find a way nearly everywhere along sunny and through that have a smooth in the mountains of ark like surface strewn with brown needles and now you cross a wild garden now a meadow now a stream and ever and anon you from all the groves and flowers upon some granite pavement or high bare ridge commanding superb views above the waving sea of far and near one would experience but little difficulty in riding on horseback through the successive all the way up to the storm beaten of the icy peaks the deep however that extend from the of the range cut the more or less completely into sections and prevent the mounted from tracing them this simple arrangement in and sections brings the forest as a whole within the comprehension of every observer the different species are ever found occupying the same relative positions to one another as controlled by soil climate and the comparative vigor of each species in taking and holding the ground and so are these relations one need never be at a loss in within a few hundred feet the elevation above sea level by the trees alone for notwithstanding some of the species range upward for several thousand feet and all pass one another more or less yet even those possessing the greatest range are available in this connection in as much as they take on new forms corresponding with the variations in crossing the plains of the and san from the west and reaching the foot hills you enter the lower fringe of the forest composed of small oaks and pines growing so far apart that not one twentieth of the surface of the is in shade at clear after advancing fifteen or twenty miles and making an ascent of from two to three thousand feet you reach edge of the the lower margin of the main pine belt composed of the gigantic sugar pine yellow pine incense and next you come to the magnificent silver fir belt and lastly to the upper pine belt which sweeps up the rocky of the summit peaks in a wavering fringe to a height of from ten to twelve thousand feet the mountains of this general order of distribution with reference to climate dependent on elevation is perceived at once but there are other as far reaching in this connection that become manifest only after patient observation and study perhaps the most interesting of these is the arrangement of the forests in long bands together into patterns and in charming variety the key to this beautiful harmony is the ancient where they flowed the trees followed tracing their wavering courses along over and over high rolling the of says are growing upon one of the of an ancient all the forests of the are growing upon but vanish like the that make them every storm that falls upon them them cutting and carrying away their material into new until at length they are no longer by any save students who their forms down from the fresh still in process of formation thi those that are more and more ancient and more and more obscured by vegetation and all kinds of post had the ice sheet that once covered all the range been melted simultaneously from the foot hills to the the would of course have been left almost bare of soil and these noble forests would be wanting many groves and would

unlike the fur gathering strangers they had hitherto known caring nothing about trade and when at length they came to know him better and saw that from year to year the growing things of the woods and were his only objects of pursuit they called him the man of grass a title of which he was proud during his first summer on the waters of the he made fort his making excursions from this bay post in

winter rains bearing in mind the big pine he had heard of he set out on an excursion up the valley in search of it and how he and what dangers and hardships he endured are best told in his own journal from which i quote as follows october weather dull cold and cloudy when my friends in england are made acquainted with my travels i fear they will think i have told them nothing but my miseries i quitted my camp early in the morning to survey the neighboring country leaving my guide to take charge of the horses until my return in the evening about an hour s walk from the camp i met an indian who on perceiving me instantly strung his bow the mountains of placed on his left arm a sleeve of skin and stood on the being quite sure that conduct was prompted by fear and not by hostile intentions the poor fellow having probably never seen such a being as myself before i laid my gun at my feet on the ground and waved my hand for him to come to me which he did slowly and with great caution i then made him place his bow and quiver of arrows beside my gun and striking a light gave him a smoke out of my own pipe and a present of a few beads with my pencil i made a rough sketch of the and pine tree which i wanted to obtain and drew his attention to it when he instantly pointed with his hand to the hills fifteen or twenty miles distant towards the south and when i expressed my intention of going thither cheerfully set out to accompany me at midday i reached my long wished f or pines and lost no time in examining them and to collect specimens and seeds new and strange things seldom fail to make strong impressions and ai e therefore frequently over j so that lest i should never see my friends in england to inform them of this most beautiful and immensely grand tree i shall here state the dimensions of the largest i could find among several that had been blown down by the wind at feet from the ground its is feet inches at feet feet inches the extreme length feet as it was impossible either to climb the tree or it down i endeavored to knock off the by at them ball when the report of my gun brought eight indians all of them painted with red earth armed with bows arrows bone tipped and they appeared anything but friendly i explained to them what i wanted and they seemed satisfied and sat down to smoke but presently i saw one of them string his bow and another his flint knife with a pair of wooden and it on the wrist of his right hand ther testimony of their intentions was the forests to save myself by flight was impossible so without hesitation i stepped back about five paces cocked my gun drew one of the pistols out of my belt and holding it in my left hand and the gun in my right showed myself determined to fight for my life as much as possible i endeavored to preserve my coolness and thus we stood looking at one another without making any movement or uttering a word for perhaps ten minutes when one at last who seemed to be the leader gave a sign that they wished for some tobacco this i signified that they should have if they fetched a quantity of they went off immediately in search of them and no sooner were they all out of sight than i picked up my three and some twigs of the trees and made the possible retreat hurrying back to the camp which i reached before dusk i now write lying on the grass with my gun cocked beside me and these lines by the light of my candle namely an piece of wood this grand pine discovered under such exciting circumstances named in honor of his friend dr of london the trunk is a smooth round delicately

is a constant demand for the and because an ax and saw and are all the capital required for the business many of that drifting unsteady class of men so large iu engage in it for a few months in the year when hunters hands etc touch their bottom dollar and the forests find themselves out of employment they say well i can at least go to the sugar pines and make a few posts are set in the ground and a single length cut from the first tree produces boards enough for the walls and roof of a cabin all the rest the makes is for sale and he is speedily independent no gardener or is more sweetly than these rough while engaged in this business but the they make is most deplorable the sugar from which the common name is derived is to my taste the best of sweets â better than sugar it from the where wounds have been made either by forest fires or the the mountains of ax in the shape of irregular crisp like which are crowded together in masses of considerable size like clusters of beads when fresh it is perfectly white and delicious but because most of the wounds on which it is found have been made by fire the sap is stained on the surface and the hardened sugar becomes brown indians are fond of it but on account of its properties only small quantities may be eaten bears so fond of sweet things in general seem never to taste it at least i have failed to find any trace of their teeth in this connection no lover of trees will ever forget his first meeting with the sugar pine nor will he af ward need a poet to call him to listen what the pine tree in most pine trees there is a of expression which to most people is apt to become monotonous for the typical form however beautiful affords but little scope for individual character the sugar pine is as free from of form and motion as any oak no two are alike even to the most observer and notwithstanding they are ever tossing out their immense arms in what might seem most extravagant gestures there is a majesty and repose about them that all possibility of the grotesque or even picturesque in their general expression they are the priests of pines and seem ever to be addressing the surrounding forest the yellow pine is found growing with them on warm and the white silver fir on cool northern slopes but noble as these are the sugar pine is easily king and his arms above them in blessing while they the forests rock and wave in sign of recognition the main branches are sometimes found to be forty feet in length yet persistently simple seldom dividing at all excepting near the end but anything like a bare cable appearance is prevented by the small that extend all around them and when these superb limbs sweep out on all sides a crown sixty or seventy feet wide is formed which gracefully poised on the summit of the noble shaft and filled with sunshine is one of the most glorious forest objects conceivable commonly however there is a great of limbs toward the east away from the direction of the prevailing winds no other pine seems to me so and in approaching it we feel as if in the presence of a superior being and begin to walk with a light step holding our breath then perchance while we gaze awe stricken along comes a merry chattering and laughing to break the spell running up the trunk with no ceremony and the as if they were made only for him while the carpenter away at the bark holes in which to store his winter supply of although so wild and when the sugar pine is a remarkably proper tree in youth the old is the most original and independent in appearance of all the the young is the most regular â a strict of fashions â slim erect with leafy branches kept exactly in place each in outline and in a point the the of forms presented between the neatness of youth and bold freedom of offer a delightful study at the age of fifty or sixty s the shy fashionable form begins to be broken up branches push out in the most of places and bend with the great at once marking individual character and this being constantly from year to year by the varying action of the sunlight winds the t snow etc the individuality of the tree is never again lost in the general forest the most constant companion of this species is the yellow pine and a worthy companion it is the and the white silver fix are also more or less associated with it but on many deep soiled mountain sides the mountains op at an elevation of about feet above the sea it forms the bulk of the forest filling every swell and hollow and down plunging the majestic crowns approaching each other in bold curves make a glorious through

silver pine the silver or yellow pine as it is commonly called ranks second among the pines of the as a lumber tree and almost rivals the sugar pine in stature and of port because of its the forests superior powers of enduring variations of climate and soil it has a more extensive range than gi owing on the on the slope it is first met at an elevation of about feet and extends nearly to the upper limit of the timber line thence crossing the range by the lowest passes it to the eastern base and out for a considerable distance into the hot plains gi owing bravely upon lake and beds planting itself upon the lips of flourishing vigorously even there and tossing ripe among the ashes and of nature s the average size of full grown trees on the western slope where it is associated with the

magnificent forests scarcely invaded by any other tree it from the ordinary form in size being only about half as tall and in its and more closely bark green foliage less divided branches and larger but forms come in which make a clear separation impossible although some regard it as a distinct species it is this variety that storm swept and out among the of the q basin whether exposed to extremes of heat or cold it is like every other tree and becomes all knots and angles wholly unlike the majestic forms we have been old specimens bearing about as big as may sometimes be found clinging to the mountains of the form rocks at an elevation of seven or eight thousand feet whose highest branches scarce reach above one s shoulders i have on the beauty of these noble trees when they were towering in all their winter grandeur laden with snow â one mass of bloom in summer too when the brown clusters hang thick among the needles and the big purple are in the mellow light but it is wind storms that these colossal pines are most beautiful then they bow like their leaves streaming forward all in direction and when the sun shines upon them at the required angle entire groves glow as if every the fall of light on the royal crown of a palm is a glorious spectacle the sun flood the forests breaking upon the glossy leaves in long lance rays like mountain water among but to me there is something more impressive in the fall of light upon these silver pines it seems beaten to the finest dust and is shed off in of minute that seem to come from the very heart of the trees as if hke rain falling upon fertile soil it had been absorbed to in flowers of this species also gives forth the finest music to the wind after listening to it in all kinds of winds night and day season after season i think i could to my position on the mountains by this pine music alone if you would catch the tones of separate needles a tree they are well tempered and give forth no uncertain sound each standing out with no interference excepting during heavy then you may detect the click of one needle upon another readily from their free wing uke hum some idea of their temper may be drawn from the fact that notwithstanding they are so long the that give rise to the peculiar of the light are made at the rate of about two hundred and fifty per minute when a sugar pine and one of this species equal in size are observed together the latter is seen to be far more simple in manners more graceful and its beauty is of a kind more easily appreciated but then it is on the other hand much less dignified and original in the silver pine seems eager to shoot aloft even while it is in autumn sun 
80,gold you may still detect a but the sugar pine seems too unconsciously noble and too complete in every way to leave room for even a care the mountains of tree is the king of the as the sugar pine is king of pines it is by far the most majestic i ever beheld in any forest and one of the lai st and longest lived of the giants that flourish throughout the main pine belt often a height of nearly feet and a of six or seven the gi is not too close the strong spreading branches come more than down the trunk and these ai e hung with innumerable slender swaying that are handsomely with the short

growing tall and mast like to a height of feet and is greatly as a lumber tree but in the it is scattered among other trees or forms small groves seldom ascending higher than feet and never making what would be called a forest it is not particular in its choice of soil â wet or dry smooth or rocky it makes out to live well on them all two of the largest specimens i have measured are in valley one of which is more than eight feet in and is growing upon the of the that occupied the south fork the other is nearly as large growing upon blocks of granite that have been shaken from the front of the liberty cap near the fall no other tree seems so capable of to earthquake and many of these rough slopes are occupied by it almost exclusively especially in by the spray of incense the incense is

artists and the foliage is tinted with a warmer yellow than that of any other in the woods casting your eye over the general forest from some ridge top the color alone of its is sufficient to identify it in any company in youth say up to the age of seventy or eighty years no other tree forms so strictly a from top to bottom the branches outward and downward in bold excepting the younger ones near the top which while the lowest to the ground and all spread out in flat beautifully and upon one another as it becomes older it grows strikingly irregular and picturesque large special branches put out at right angles from the trunk form big stubborn elbows and then shoot up parallel with the very old trees are usually dead at the top the main above ample masses of green gray and covered and full of holes by the the are exceedingly beautiful no waving in shady is more beautiful in form and texture or half so inspiring in color and fragrance in its prime the whole tree is with them so that they shed off rain and snow like a roof making fine for storm bound birds and but if you would see the in all its glory you must the of go to the woods in winter then it is laden with of four sided

throughout all the of its life on the mountains come what may the noble grandeur of the species 
80,is patent to every eye magnificent silver fir or red fir this is the most of all the giants of the woods far surpassing its companion species in this respect and easily distinguished from it by the red bark which is also more closely than that of the white and by its larger more regularly and branches and by its leaves which are shorter and grow all around the and point upward the of in size

felt brooding over everything great and small big tree between the heavy pine and silver fir we find the big tree the king of all the in the world the noblest of a noble race it extends in a widely interrupted belt from a small grove on the middle fork of the american river to the head of deer creek a distance of about miles the the mountains of northern limit being near the thirty ninth parallel the southern a little below the ty sixth and the elevation of the belt above the sea from about to feet from the american river gi to the forest on king s river the species s only in small isolated groups so distributed along the belt that three of the in it are from forty to sixty miles wide but from king s river southward the is not to mere groves but extends across the broad of the and rivers in noble forests a distance of nearly seventy miles the of this part of the belt being broken only by deep the the largest of the northern groves an area of three or four square miles a short distance to the southward of the famous grove along the rim of the of the south fork of king s river there is a majestic forest of about six miles long by two wide this is the assemblage of big trees that may fairly be called a forest descending the divide between the king s river and you enter the grand forests that form the main continuous portion of the belt advancing southward the giants become more and more in heaving their massive crowns into the sky from every ridge and slope and waving onward in graceful compliance with the complicated of the region the finest of the section of the belt is on the broad ridge between marble creek and the middle fork and extends from the granite overlooking the hot plains to within a few the miles of the cool fountains of the summit peaks the extreme upper limit of the belt is reached between the middle and south forks of the at an elevation of feet but the finest block of big tree forest in the entire belt is on the north fork of in the northern groves there are comparatively few young trees or but here for every old storm stricken giant there are many in all the glory of prime vigor and for each of these a crowd of eager hopeful young trees and growing heartily on rocky along and in the moist of meadows seemingly in hot pursuit of eternal life but though the area occupied by the species so much from north to south there is no marked increase in the size of the trees a height of feet and a near the gi of about feet is perhaps about the average size of trees situated specimens feet in are not very rare and a few are nearly feet high in the grove there are trees over feet in height the of which by careful is feet the largest i have yet met in the course of my is a majestic old monument in the king s forest it is feet inches in inside the bark four feet from the ground under the most favorable conditions these giants probably live years or more though few of even the larger trees are more than half as old i never saw a big tree that had died a natural death accidents they seem to be immortal the mountains of being from au the diseases that and kill other trees unless destroyed by man they live on until burned smashed by lightning or east down by storms or by the giving way of the ground on which they stand the age of one that was in the grove for the sake of ha ing its stump for a dancing floor was about years and its measured the stump feet inside the bark another that was cut down in the king s forest was about the same size but nearly a thousand years older years though not a very old looking tree it was to e a section for exhibition and thus an opportunity was given to count its annual rings of growth the colossal monument in the king s forest mentioned above is bin half thi and i spent a day in making an estimate of its age clearing away the sm face with an ax and carefully counting the annual rings with the aid of a pocket the wood rings in the section i laid bare were so involved and in some places that i was not able to determine its age exactly but i counted over rings which showed that this tree was in its prime swaying in the winds when christ walked the earth no other tree in the world as far as i know has looked down on so many centuries as the or opens such impressive and suggestive views into history so exquisitely harmonious and finely balanced are even the very of these of the woods in all their proportions and there never is anything overgrown or monstrous the looking about them on coming in sight of them for the first time you are likely to say oh see what beautiful noble looking trees are towering there among the s and pines â their gi being in the mean time in gi eat part invisible but to the living eye it will be manifested sooner or later stealing slowly on the senses like the gi of or the lofty their gi eat size is hidden from the inexperienced ver as long as they are seen at a 
80,distance in one harmonious view when however you approach them and walk round them you begin to wonder at their colossal size and seek a measuring rod these giants considerably at the base but not more than is required for beauty and safety and the only reason that this seems in some cases excessive is that only a comparatively small section of the shaft is seen at once in near views one that i measured in the king s forest was feet in at the ground and feet in feet above the ground showing that the of the trunk as a whole is fine and when you stand back far enough to see f the massive columns from the swelling to the lofty summit in a dome of you rejoice in the display of combined and beauty about a hundred feet or more of the trunk is usually but its massive simplicity is relieved by the bark which instead of making an irregular run parallel like the of an column and to some extent by of slender that wave lightly in the winds and cast the mountains of of shade seeming to have been pinned on here and there for the sake of beauty only the young trees have slender simple branches down to the ground put on with strict regularity sharply at the top about half way down and drooping in handsome curves at the base by the time the is five or six hundred years old this habit into the m rounded dome form of middle age which in turn takes on the eccentric of old age no other tree in the forest has foliage so or presents outlines so firmly di and so steadily subordinate to a special type a looking branch five to eight feet thick may be seen pushing out abruptly from the smooth trunk as if sm e to throw the regular curve into confusion but as soon as the general outline is reached it stops short and in spreading of law abiding just as if every tree were growing beneath some huge invisible bell glass against whose sides every branch was being pressed and yet somehow indulging in so many small from the regular form that there is still an appearance of freedom the foliage of the is dark green in color while the older trees to a warm yellow tint like the bark is rich brown in young trees and in shady portions of the old while the ground is covered with brown leaves and forming of extraordinary richness not to mention the flowers and that rejoice about them in their seasons walk the woods at any time the forests of year and you will say they are the most beautiful and majestic on earth beautiful and impressive meet you everywhere the colors of tree and flower rock and sky light and shade strength and ance and of bushes tree pillars about as rigid as granite roses and the smallest of their kind blooming around the feet of the giants and of the lowly where the fall then in winter the trees themselves break forth in bloom of small four sided crowd the ends of the slender the whole tree and when ripe the air and the ground with golden the fertile are bright grass green measuring about two inches in length by one and a half in thickness and are

world nature takes care however that not one seed in a million shall at all and of those that do perhaps not one l the mountains of in ten thousand is to live through the many of storm fire and snow crushing that beset their youth the is the happy of most of the out of every hundred perhaps ninety fall to his share and unless cut off by his ivory they shake out their seeds and remain on the tree for many years watching the at their harvest work in the indian summer is one of the most delightful imaginable the woods are calm and the ripe colors are blazing in all their glory the laden trees stand motionless in the warm air and you may see the crimson the prince of some dead limb or fallen trunk with his bill and ever and anon filling the with his happy the humming bird too dwells in these noble woods and may be seen glancing among the flowers or resting on some here also are the familiar robin of the and the brown and bears so obviously fitted for these majestic and the making more vital stir than all the bears birds and humming wings together as soon as any accident happens to the crown of these such as being stricken off by lightning or broken by storms then the branches beneath the wound no matter how situated seem to be excited like a colony of bees that have lost their queen and become anxious to repair the damage limbs that have grown outward for centuries at right angles to the trunk begin to turn upward to the forests assist in making a new crown each speedily assuming the special form of true even in the case of mere burned half through some mere ornamental will try to go aloft and do its 
81,best as a leader in forming a new head groups of two or three of these grand trees are often found standing lose together the seeds from which they spring having probably grown on ground cleared for their reception by the fall of a large tree of a former generation these patches of fresh mellow soil beside the roots of the fallen giant may be from forty to sixty feet wide and they are speedily occupied by out of these perhaps two or three may become trees forming those close groups called three graces loving couples etc for even supposing that the trees should stand twenty or thirty feet apart while young by the time they are their trunks will touch and crowd against each other and even appear as one in some cases it is generally believed that this grand was once far more widely distributed over the but after long and careful study i have come to the conclusion that it never was at least since the close of the period because a search along the of the groves and in the between fails to reveal a single trace of its previous existence beyond its present bounds notwithstanding i feel confident that if every in the range were to die to day numerous monuments of their existence would remain of so a nature as to be available for the student more than ten thousand years hence the mountains of in the first place we might notice that no species of tree in the range keeps its individuals so well together as a mile is perhaps the greatest distance of any from the main body and all of those that have come under my observation are young instead of old trees of a more extended growth again trunks frequently endure for centuries after they fall i have a specimen block cut from a fallen trunk which is hardly from specimens cut from living trees although the old trunk fragment from which it was derived has lain in the damp forest more than years probably thrice as long the time e in the case is simply this when the ponderous trunk to which the old belonged fell it sunk itself into the gi thus making a long straight ditch and in the middle of this ditch a silver fir is growing that is now four feet in and years old as determined by cutting it half through and counting the rings thus that the remnant of the that made the ditch has lain on the gi more than years for it is evident that to find the whole time we must add to the years the time that the vanished portion of the trunk lay in the ditch before being burned out of the way the time that passed before the seed from which the fir sprang fell into the prepared soil and took root now because trunks are never wholly consumed in one forest e and those fires only at considerable intervals and because after being cleared are often left for centuries it becomes the forests evident that the trunk remnant in question may probably have lain a thousand years or more and this instance is by no means a rare one but admitting that upon those supposed to have been once covered with every tree may have fallen and every may have been burned or leaving not a remnant many of the made by the fall of the ponderous trunks and the made by their roots would remain patent for thousands of years after the last of the trunks that made them had vanished much of this ditch writing would no doubt be quickly by the flood action of overflowing streams and rain washing but no portion would remain engraved on ridge tops beyond such destructive action for where all the conditions are favorable it is almost now these historic and root occur in all the present groves and but as far as i have observed not the faintest of one presents itself outside of them we therefore conclude that the area covered by has not been diminished the last eight or ten thousand years and probably not at all in post times is the species to f what are its relations to climate soil and associated trees f all the phenomena bearing on these questions also throw light as we shall endeavor to show upon the peculiar distribution of the species and sustain the conclusion already arrived at on the question of extension in the northern groups as we have seen there the mountains of are few young trees or growing up around the failing old ones to the race and in as much as those aged so nearly are the only ones commonly known the species to most seems doomed to speedy as being nothing more than an remnant in the so called struggle for life by pines and that have driven it into its last in moist where climate is favorable but the language of the ma continuous forests of the south a very different impression no tree of all the forest is more established in with climate and soil it grows heartily everywhere â on rocky along and in the deep moist of meadows with a multitude of and crowding up around the aged seemingly abundantly able to maintain the forest in prime vigor for every old tree there is one or more in all the glory of prime and for each of these many young trees and crowds of so that if all the trees of any section of the main forest were ranged together according to age a veiy promising curve would be presented all the way up from last year s to giants and with the young and middle aged portion of the curve many times longer than the old portion even as far north as the i counted and growing upon a piece of rough soil not exceeding two acres 
81,in area this soil bed is about seven years old and has been almost simultaneously by pines and the presenting a simple and instinctive illustration of the struggle for life among the rival species and it was interesting to note that the conditions thus far affecting them have enabled the young to gain a marked advantage in every instance uke the above i have observed that the is capable of growing on both and soil than its rivals but requires more sunshine than they the latter fact being clearly shown wherever a sugar pine or fir is growing in close contact with a of about equal age and size and equally exposed to the sun the branches of the latter in such cases are always less leafy toward the south however where the becomes more and numerous the rival trees become less so and where they mix with they mostly grow up beneath them like slender among of indian corn upon a bed of sandy flood soil i counted ninety from one to twelve feet high on a patch of ground once occupied by four large sugar pines which lay beneath them â an instance of conditions which have enabled to crowd out the pines i also noted eighty six vigorous upon a piece of fresh ground prepared for their reception by fire thus fire the great of also bare virgin ground one of the conditions essential for its gi from the seed fresh ground is however furnished in sufficient quantities for the constant renewal of the forests without fire by the of old trees the soil is thus and and many trees are planted the mountains op for every one that falls land slips and floods also give rise to bare virgin ground and a tree now and then owes its existence to a wolf or but the most regular supply of fresh soil is furnished by the fall of aged trees the changes in progress in the bearing on the of tree life are entirely especially as to the time and the means employed by nature in them it is constantly asserted in a vague way that the was vastly than now and that the increasing will of itself leaving its ground to other trees supposed capable of flourishing in a climate but that can and does grow on as ground as any of its present rivals is manifest in a thousand places why then it will be asked are always found in greatest abundance in well watered places where streams are abundant simply because a gi of those streams the thirsty knows well that in eveiy grove he will find running water but it is a mistake to suppose that the water is the cause of the grove being there on the contrary the grove is the cause of the water being there drain off the water and the trees will remain but cut off the trees and the streams will vanish never was cause more completely mistaken for effect than in the case of these related phenomena of woods and streams and i confess that at first i shared in the blunder when attention is called to the method of stream making it will be apprehended at once the forests the roots of this immense tree fill the ground f a thick that and holds ba â k the rains and melting only allowing them to and flow gently indeed every fallen leaf and as well as long clasping root and prostrate trunk may be regarded as a dam the of storm clouds and it as blessings all through the summer instead of allowing it to go headlong in short lived floods is also checked by the dense foliage to a gi extent than by any other tree and the air is entangled in masses and broad sheets that are quickly while thirsty winds are not allowed to go and along the gi so great is the of water in many places in the main belt that and meadows are created by the killing of the trees a single trunk falling across a stream in the woods forms a dam feet long and from ten to thirty feet high giving rise to a pond which the trees within its reach these dead trees fall in turn thus making a clearing while gradually changing the pond into a or meadow for a growth of and in some instances a series of small or meadows rise above one another on a which are gradually into one another forming sloping or meadows which make striking features of woods and since all the trees that have fallen into them have been preserved they contain records of the generations that have passed since they began to form since then it is a fact that thousands of are growing on what is termed dry ground the dip and even clinging like mountain pines to in granite and since it has also been shown that the extra moisture found in connection with the is an of their presence instead of a cause of then presence then the notions as to the former extension of the species and its near approach to based upon its supposed dependence on greater moisture are seen to be the in the rain and since the close of the period in the is much less than is commonly guessed the highest post are well preserved in all the upper river channels and they are not greatly higher than the spring of the present showing that no extraordinary has taken place in the volume of the upper of streams since they came into existence but in the mean time all this complicated question of change the plain fact remains that the present rain and is abundantly sufficient for the luxuriant growth of forests indeed all my observations tend to show that in a prolonged the sugar pines and would perish before the not alone because of the greater of individual 
81,trees but because the species can endure more and make the most of whatever moisture falls again if the and distribution of the species be as a result of the of the range then instead of increasing as it does in individuals toward the south where the is less it should the forests if then the peculiar distribution of has not been governed by superior conditions of soil as to or moisture by what has it been governed in the course of my studies i observed that the northern gi the only ones i was at first acquainted with were on just those portions of the general forest soil belt that were first laid bare toward the close of the period when the ice sheet began to break up into individual and while searching the wide basin of the san and trying to account for the absence of where every condition seemed favorable for its growth it occurred to me that this remarkable gap in the belt is exactly in the basin of the vast ancient de of the san and king s which poured its frozen floods to the plain fed by the that fell on more than fifty miles of the summit i then perceived that the next great gap in the belt to the northward forty miles wide extending between the and groves s in the basin of the great ancient de of the and and that the smaller gap between the and groves occurs in the basin of the smaller of the the wider the ancient j the wider the corresponding gap in the belt finally pursuing my across the of the and i discovered that the belt attained its greatest development just where owing to the peculiarities of the region the ground had been most per v the mountains op f protected from the main ice rivers that continued to pour past from the summit fountains long after the smaller local had been melted taking now a general view of the belt beginning at the south we see that the majestic ancient were shed right and left down the valleys of and king s rivers by the lofty spurs above the warm filled of the and then next northward occurs the wide less channel or basin of the ancient san and king s river de then the warm protected spots of and groves then the channel of the ancient next the sheltered ground of the and groves then the less channel of the grand ancient de of the and then the warm old ground of the and groves it appears therefore that just where at a certain period in the history of the the were not there the is and just where the were there the is not what the other conditions may have been that enabled to establish itself upon these oldest and warmest portions of the main soil belt i cannot say i might venture to state however in this connection that since the forests present a more and more ancient aspect as they extend southward i am inclined to think that the species was distributed from the south while the sugar pine its great rival in the northern groves seems to have come around the head of the the valley and down the from the north consequently when the soil beds were first thrown open to on the melting of the ice sheet the may have established itself along the available portions of the south half of the range prior to the arrival of the sugar pine while the sugar pine took possession of the north half prior to the arrival of but however much uncertainty may attach to this branch of the question there are no shadows upon the grand general relationship we have pointed out between the present distribution of and the ancient of the and when we bear in mind that all the present forests of the are young growing on soil recently deposited and that the flank of the range with all its is new born recently and brought to the light of day from beneath the ice mantle of the winter then a thousand lawless mysteries disappear and broad take their places but although all the observed phenomena bearing on the post history of this colossal tree point to the conclusion that it never was more widely distributed on the since the close of the epoch that its present forests are scarcely past prime if indeed they have reached prime that the post day of the species is probably not half done yet when from a wider outlook the vast antiquity of the is considered and its ancient richness in species and individuals comparing our giant and s of the coast range the only species of se the mountains of with the twelve species already discovered and described by and some of which seem to have flourished over vast in the ai regions and in europe and own during and times â then indeed it becomes plain that our two species to narrow within the limits of are mere of the both as to species and individuals and that they probably are to but the verge of a period beginning in times may have a breadth of of thousands of years not to mention the possible existence of conditions calculated to and both species and individuals this however is a branch of the question into which i do not now purpose to enter in studying the fate of om forest king we have thus far considered the action of purely natural causes only but unfortunately man is in the woods and waste and pure destruction are making rapid if the importance of forests were at au understood even from an their preservation would call forth the most watchful attention of government only of late years by means of forest has the simplest for available been laid while in many of the finest groves every species of destruction 
81,is still moving on with speed in the course of my i found no fewer than five mills on or near the lower edge of the belt all of which were cutting considerable quantities of big tree lumber j the most of the group are doomed to feed the mills recently erected near them and a company of are now cutting the magnificent forest on king s river in these operations waste far use for after the choice young trees on any given spot have been the woods are fired to clear the ground of limbs and refuse with reference to further operations and of course most of the and are destroyed these mill however are small as compared with the comprehensive destruction caused by incredible numbers of sheep are to the mountain pastures every summer and their course is ever marked by desolation every wild garden is trodden down the shrubs are stripped of leaves as if devoured by and the woods are burned running fires are set everywhere with a view to clearing the ground of prostrate trunks to the movements of the flocks and improve the pastures the entire forest belt is thus swept and from one extremity of the range to the other and with the exception of the suffers most of all indians burn off the in certain to deer hunting and carelessly allow their to run but the fires of the or form more than ninety per cent of all destructive fires that range the forests it appears therefore that notwithstanding our forest king might live on in nature s keeping it is rapidly vanishing before the fire and the mountains of of man and unless measures be speedily invented and applied in a few at the farthest all that will be left of will be a few and monuments two or pine this species forms the bulk of the forests extending along the range above the fir up to a height of from to feet above the sea growing in beautiful order upon that are scarcely changed as yet by post compared with the giants of the lower this is a small tree seldom a height of a hundred feet the largest specimen i ever ed was ninety feet in height and a little over six in four feet from the ground the average height of mature trees throughout the entire belt is probably not far from fifty or sixty feet with a of two feet it is a well rather handsome little pine with brown bark and crooked much divided branches which cover the greater portion of the trunk not so however as to prevent its being seen the lower limbs curve downward gradually take a position about half way up the trunk then more and more toward the summit thus forming a sharp top the foliage is short and rigid two leaves in a arranged in comparatively long at the ends of the tough the are about two inches the long growing in clusters among the needles without making any striking effect except while very young when they are of a vivid crimson color and the whole tree appears to be dotted with brilliant flowers the are still more on account of their gi eat abundance often giving a yellow tinge to the whole mass of the foliage and filling the air with no other pine on the range is so regularly planted as this one forests sweep along the sides of the high rocky valleys for miles without interruption still strictly speaking they are not dense for of sunshine and flowers find their way into the darkest places where the trees grow and tall gi are specially abundant beneath them growing over all the ground in sunshine and shade over extensive like a s crop and serving as pasture for the multitude of sheep that are driven from the arid plains every summer as soon as the snow is melted the two pine more than any other is subject to destruction by fire the thin bark is and sprinkled with as though it had been down upon it like rain so that even the gi een trees catch fire readily and during strong winds whole forests are destroyed the flames leaping from tree to tree forming one continuous belt of roaring fire that goes and racing onward above the bending woods like the grass fires of a during the calm dry season of indian summer the fire quietly along the gi feeding on the dry needles and then arriving at the foot of a tree the bark is and the mountains of the heated ah in a powerful current increasing in and dragging the flames then the leaves catch fire and an immense column of flame beautifully on the edges and tinted a rose purple hue rushes aloft thirty or forty feet above the top of the tree forming a grand spectacle especially on a dark night it lasts however only a few seconds vanishing with rapidity to be succeeded by others along the at irregular intervals for weeks at a time â tree after tree flashing and darkening leaving the trunks and branches hardly the heat however is sufficient to kill the trees and in a few years the bark and falls off miles in extent are thus killed and left standing with the branches on and rigid appearing gray in the distance like misty clouds later the branches drop off leaving a forest of at length the roots decay and the forlorn trunks are blown down during some storm and piled one upon another the ground until they are consumed by the next fire and leave it ready for a fresh crop the endurance of the species is shown by its wandering occasionally out over the plains with the yellow pine and climbing mountain sides with the dwarf pine clinging to any chance support in and of rocks â always however showing the effects of such hardships in 
82,every e down in sheltered lake hollows on beds of rich it so far from the common foi c as frequently to be taken for a distinct species here it grows in dense like from forty to the eighty feet high bending all together to the breeze and whirling in more than any other tree in the woods i have frequently found specimens fifty feet high less than five inches in being thus slender and at the same time well clad with leafy boughs it is bent to the ground when laden with soft snow beautiful arches in endless variety some of which last until the melting of the snow in spring mountain pine the mountain pine is king of the woods brave hardy and long lived towering above its companions and becoming stronger and more imposing just where other species begin to and disappear at its best it is usually about ninety feet high and five or six in though a specimen is often met considerably larger than this the trunk is as massive and as suggestive of enduring strength as that of an oak about two thirds of the trunk is commonly free of limbs but close of occur all the way down like those which adorn the colossal shafts of the bark is deep brown upon trees that occupy exposed situations near its upper limit and rather deeply the main running nearly parallel with each other and connected by conspicuous cross which with one exception are as far as i have noticed peculiar to this species the mountains of the are from four to eight inches long slender and somewhat curved resembling those of the common white pine of the atlantic coast they grow in clusters of about from three to six or seven becoming as they increase in weight chiefly by the bending of the branches this species is nearly related to the sugar pine and though not half so tall it constantly suggests its noble relative in the way that it extends its long arms and in general habit the mountain pine is first met on the upper margin of the fir gi owing singly in a subdued form in what appear as chance situations without making much impression on the general forest continuing up through the two pines in the same scattered growth it begins to show its character and at an elevation of about feet its noblest development near the middle of the range tossing its tough aims in the frosty air storms and feeding on them and reaching the grand old age of years or red the is a rock tree occupying the and where there is scarcely a handful of soil at a height of from to feet in such situations the trunk is frequently over eight feet in and not much more in height the top is almost always dead in old trees and great stubborn limbs push the f be ts out that are mostly ami bare at the ends but covered and here and there with of gray foliage some are mere as l road as long decorated with a few leafy

back into its place in the warm air as dry and and fresh as young just out of the some of the finest groves i have yet found are on the southern slopes of s there are also many charming companies on the head waters of the and san and in general the species is so far from being rare the forests that you can scarcely fail to find groves of considerable extent in crossing the range choose what pass you may the mountain pine grows beside it and more frequently the two species but there are many beautiful groups individuals or more without a single intruder i wish i had space to write more of the surpassing beauty of this favorite every is sure to regard it with special admiration even seeking only game or gold stop to gaze on first meeting it and to themselves that s a mighty pretty tree some of them adding d d pretty in autumn when its are ripe the little striped and the and the crow make a happy stir in its groves the deer love to lie down beneath its spreading branches bright streams from the snow that is always near ripple through its groves and precious carpets in its shade but the best words only hint its charms come to the mountains and see dwarf pine this species forms the extreme edge of the timber line throughout nearly the whole extent of the range on both it is first met growing in company with ana on the upper margin of the belt as an erect tree from fifteen to thirty feet high and from one to two feet in thickness thence it goes straggling up the of the the of summit peaks upon or wherever it can obtain a to an elevation of from to feet where it to a mass

82,occur in clusters about an inch wide down among the leaves and as they are colored bright they give rise to a lively appearance little looked for in such a tree pines are commonly regarded as sky loving trees that must necessarily or die this species a marked exception creeping lowly in compliance with the most demands of yet enduring bravely to a more advanced age than many of its lofty relatives in the sun lands below seen from a distance it would never be taken for a tree of any kind yonder for example is cathedral peak some three miles away with a scattered growth of this pine creeping like over the roof and around the edges of the north nowhere giving any hint of an ascending when approached quite near it still appears and and is so low that one experiences no great difficulty in over the top of it yet it is seldom absolutely prostrate at its lowest usually a height of three or four feet with a main trunk and branches and above it as if in ascending they had been checked by a ceiling against which they had grown and been compelled to spread the winter snow is indeed such a ceiling lasting half the year while the pressed surface is made yet by violent winds armed with cutting sand that beat down any shoot that offers to rise much above the general level and the dead trunks and branches in beautiful patterns stormy nights i have often beneath the arches of this little the mountains op pine the needles have accumulated for centuries make fine beds a fact well known to other s such as deer and wild sheep who out oval hollows and lie beneath the larger trees in safe and comfortable concealment the forests the of this lowly dwarf is far greater than would be guessed here for example is a specimen growing at an elevation of feet which seems as though it might be plucked up by the roots for it is only three and a half inches in and its is hardly three feet above the ground cutting it half through and counting the annual rings with the aid of a we find its age to be no less than years here is another telling specimen about the same height years old whose trunk is only six inches in and one of its hardly an eighth of an inch in inside the bark is seventy five years old and so filled with and so well by storms that we may tie it in knots like a whip cord white pine species is widely distributed throughout the rocky mountains and over all the higher of the many of the great basin between the mountains and the where it is known as white pine in the it is scattered along the eastern flank from bloody southward nearly to the extremity of the range opposite the village of lone pine nowhere forming any portion of the general forest from its peculiar position in loose straggling parties it seems to have been derived from the basin to the eastward where it is abundant the mountains of it is a larger tree than the dwarf at an elevation of about feet above the sea it often a height of forty or fifty feet and a of from three to five feet the open freely when ripe and are twice as large as those of the and the foliage and branches are more en having a tendency to sweep out in free wild em n es like those of the mountain pine to which it is closely allied it is seldom found lower than feet above sea level but from this elevation it upward over the to the extreme limit of tree growth where in its storm crushed condition it is more like the species throughout and it is one of the principal timber trees great quantities being cut every year for the mines the famous white pine white pine city and the white pine mountains have derived their names from it needle pine a this species is in the to the southern portion of the range about the head waters of kings and rivers where it forms extensive forests and in some places the dwarf pine to the extreme limit of tree growth it is first met at an elevation of between and feet and runs up to without seeming to suffer greatly from the climate or the of the soil it is a much finer tree than the the forests dwarf pine instead of growing in and low it in some way to maintain an erect position and usually stands single wherever the young trees are at all sheltered they grow up straight and with delicately and ascending branches t with glossy bottle at middle age certain limbs are and pushed far out for the bearing of after the manner of the sugar pine and in old age these branches and cast about in every direction giving rise to very picturesque effects tiie trunk becomes deep brown aud rough like that of the mountain pine while the mountains of the young are of a strange dull blue color clustered on the upper branches when ripe they are from three to four inches long brown resembling in every way those of the mountain pine excepting the sugar pine no tree on the mountains is so capable of individual sion while in grace of form and movement it constantly reminds one of the the largest specimen i measured was a little over five feet in and ninety feet in height but this is more than twice the ordinary size this species is common throughout the rocky mountains and most of the short of the great basin where it is called the fox tail pine from its long dense leaf on the hot creek white pine and golden gate it is quite abundant about a foot or 
82,eighteen inches of the ends of the branches is packed with stiff needles which like an electric fox or s tail the needles have a glossy polish and the sunshine through them makes them bum with silvery while their number and elastic temper tell delightfully in the winds this tree is here still more original and picturesque than in the far surpassing not only its companion in this respect but also the most noted of the oaks some stand firmly erect with radiant down to the ground forming slender towers of shining others with two or three branches pushed out at right angles to the trunk and clad with take the form of beautiful ornamental crosses again in the same woods you the find trees that are made up of several united near the ground spreading at the sides in a plane parallel to the of the mountain with the elegant hung in charming order between them making a harp held against the main wind lines where they are most effective in playing the gi and storm and besides these there are many forms alone or in gi with innumerable drooping beneath the arches or radiant above them and many lowly giants of no particular form that have the storms of a thousand years but whether old or young sheltered or exposed to the wildest this tree is ever found and and offers a richer and more varied series of forms to the artist than any other i know of nut pine the nut pine covers or rather the eastern flank of the to which it is mostly in bush like patches from the margin of the sage plains to an elevation of from to feet a more fruitful and could not be conceived all the species we have been make more or less distant from the typical spire form but none goes so far as this without any apparent of climate or soil it remains near the ground throwing out crooked branches like an orchard the mountains of apple tree and seldom a single shoot higher than fifteen or twenty feet above the ground the average thickness of the trunk is perhaps about ten or twelve inches the leaves are mostly like round instead of being separated like those of other pines into and and the are green while growing and are usually found over all the tree forming quite a marked feature as seen against the gray foliage they are quite small only about two inches in length and give no promise of nuts but when we come to open them we find that about half the entire bulk of the is made up of sweet seeds the of which are nearly as large as those of nuts this is undoubtedly the most important on the and the and river indians with more and better nuts than all the other species taken together it is the indians own tree and many a white man have they killed for cutting it down in its development nature seems to have aimed at the formation of as great a fruit bearing surface as possible being so low and accessible the are readily beaten off with poles and the nuts procured by them until the scales open in seasons a single indian will gather thirty or forty of them â a fine employment of all the along the eastern base of the and on all the many mountain groups and short of the great basin this little pine is the commonest tree and the most the forests nearly every mountain is planted with it to a height of from to feet above the sea some are covered from base to summit by this one species with only a growth of on the lower slopes to break the of its curious woods which though dark looking at a distance are almost and have none of the damp leafy and hollows so characteristic of other pine woods of thousands of acres occur in continuous indeed viewed the entire basin seems to be pretty divided into level plains dotted with sage bushes and mountain chains covered with nut pines no slope is too rough none too dry for these of the red man the value of this species to is not easily it and timber for the mines and with the supplies the with fuel and rough in fruitful seasons the nut crop is perhaps greater than the wheat crop which so much influence throughout the food of the world when the crop is ripe the indians make ready the long beating poles bags baskets and are collected the women out at service among the washing or at the family huts the men leave their work old and young all are mounted on and start in great glee to the nut lands forming curiously picturesque flaming and skirts stream loosely over the two usually of each with baby in baskets on their backs or balanced on the the mountains of saddle bow while nut baskets and water project from each side and the long beating poles make angles in every direction arriving at some well known central point where grass and water are found the with baskets the men with poles ascend the to the laden trees followed by the children then the beating begins right the s fly in every direction rolling down the slopes lodging here and there against rocks and sage bushes chased and gathered by the women and children with fine natural gladness speedily mark the joyful scene of their labors as the fires are kindled and at night assembled in gay circles as they begin the first nut feast of the season the nuts are about half an inch long and a quarter of an inch in pointed at the top round at the base light brown in general color and like many other pine seeds handsomely dotted with purple like birds eggs the shells are thin and may be 
83,crushed between the thumb and finger the are white becoming brown by and are sweet to every being eaten by birds dogs horses and men perhaps less than one in a thousand of the whole crop is ever gathered still besides supplying their own wants in times of plenty the indians bring large quantities to market then they are eaten around nearly every fireside in the state and are even fed to horses occasionally instead of of other trees growing on the but forming a very small part of the general forest we may briefly notice the following the is a magnificent tree in the coast but small in the it is found only well to the northward along the banks of cool streams on the upper toward mount only a few trees of this species as far as i have seen have as yet gained a place in the woods it has evidently been derived from the coast range by way of the of connecting mountains at the head of the valley in shady and on cool stream banks of the northern we also find the the interesting tree is distributed along the western flank of the range at an elevation of about feet mostly in and it is a small glossy like a from twenty to fifty feet high and one to two feet in the fruit a green and contains one seed about the size of an and like a hence the common name the wood is fine and of a beautiful yellow color hke box sweet scented when dry though the green leaves a disagreeable the only is a small slender tree to the eastern flank of the range along stream sides below the pine belt especially in s valley and make beautiful over swift cool streams at an elevation of from to feet mixed more or less with and cotton wood and m the mountains of above these in lake the forms fine ornamental gi and lets its light shine in the autumn months the chestnut oak seems to have come from the coast range around the head of the valley like the but as it extends southward along the lower edge of the main pine belt it grows smaller until it finally to a mere bush in the coast mountains it is a fine tall rather slender tree about from sixty to seventy five feet high gi with the gi and or but unfortunately it is too good to live and is now being rapidly destroyed for besides the common oak and the grand of the foot hills and several small ones that make dense gi of there are two mountain oaks that grow with the pines up to an elevation of about feet above the sea and gi the beauty of the these are the mountain live oak and the oak named in honor of the admirable of s oak is a firm bright beautiful tree reaching a height of sixty feet four to seven feet in with wide spreading branches and gi owing at an elevation of from to feet in sunny valleys and among the and higher in a state in the cliff bound about feet above the sea it is so abundant and effective it might fairly be called the oak the leaves make beautiful the p ee ts masses of in the spring and yellow in ripe autumn while its are gathered by indians and the mountain live oak q is a tough rugged of a tree growing bravely and noble dimensions on the earthquake in deep and valleys the is usually short dividing near the ground into great wide spreading limbs and these again into a multitude of slender many of them cord like and drooping to the ground like those of the great white oak of the q the top of the tree where there is plenty of space is broad and with a dense covering of shining leaves making delightful the complicated system of gray branches as seen from beneath being exceedingly rich and picturesque no other tree that i know so regularly and completely as this under changes of climate due to changes in elevation at the foot of a feet above the sea you may find magnificent specimens of this oak fifty feet high with trunks five to seven feet in and at the head of the feet higher a dense soft low growth of the same species while all the way up the between these extremes of size and habit a perfect may be traced the largest i have seen was fifty feet high eight feet in and about seventy five feet in spread the trunk was all knots and gray like granite and about as and irregular as the on which it was growing â a type of steadfast strength chapter ix the the is by far the most interesting and influential of the surpassing every other species in force of character numbers and extent of range and in the amount of influence he brings to bear upon the health and distribution of the vast forests he go where you will throughout the noble woods of the among the giant pines and of the lower up through the towering silver to the storm bent of the summit peaks you everywhere find this little the master existence though only a few inches long so intense is his fiery vigor and restlessness he every grove with wild life and makes himself more important than even the huge bears that through the tangled beneath him every wind is fretted by his voice almost every and branch feels the sting of his sharp feet how much the growth of the trees is stimulated by this means it is not easy to learn but his action in their seeds is more nature has made him master and committed most of her crops to his the probably over fifty per cent of all the on the are cut 
83,and handled by the alone and of those of the big trees perhaps ninety per cent pass through his hands the greater portion is of course stored away for food to last during the winter and spring but some of them are tucked separately into loosely covered holes where some of the seeds and become trees but the is only one of the many provinces over which he holds sway for his dominion extends over all the belt of the coast mountains and far northward throughout the majestic forests of washington and british i make haste to mention these facts to show upon how substantial a foundation the importance i to him rests the is closely allied to the or of the eastern woods ours may be a of this species distributed westward to the pacific by way of the great lakes and the rocky mountains and thence southward along our this view is suggested by the fact that our species becomes and more like in general the farther it is traced back along the course indicated above but whatever their relationship and the forces that have acted upon them the is now the larger and more beautiful animal from the nose to the root of the tail he measures about eight inches and his tail which he so uses in his feelings is about six inches in length he wears dark gray over the back and way down the sides bright the mountains of on the belly with a of dark gray nearly black separating the upper and under colors this dividing however is not very sharply defined he has long black whiskers which gives him a rather fierce look when observed closely strong claws sharp as fish hooks and the brightest of bright eyes full of telling speculation a king s river indian told me that they call him which rapidly pronounced with the first syllable heavily is not unlike the exclamation he on his way up a tree when excited most in call him the pine and when i asked an old whether he knew our little he replied with brightening countenance oh yes of course i know him everybody knows him when i m in the woods i often find out where the deer are by his at em i call em because they re so mighty quick and all the true are more or less in speech and movements but the is so possessing as he does every attribute peculiarly concentrated he is the of flashing from branch to branch of his favorite crisp and glossy and as a q ive him wings and he would any bird in the woods his big gray cousin is a animal seemingly light enough to float on the wind yet when leaping from limb to limb or out of one to another he sometimes to gather strength as if making efforts concerning the up the shot of which he does not always feel exactly confident but the with his body leaps and in hidden strength seemingly as independent of common muscles as a mountain stream he threads the branches of the pines stirring their needles like a rustling breeze now shooting across in lines now in curves from side to side in sudden and in giddy and around the trunks getting into what seem to be the most impossible situations without sense of danger now on his now on his head yet ever graceful and his most irrepressible of energy with uttle and of perfect repose he is without exception the wildest animal i ever saw â a fiery little bolt of ufe in quick and the woods best one can hardly think of such a creature being dependent like the rest of us on climate and food but after all it requires no long acquaintance to learn he is human for he works for a living his time is in the indian summer then he s and like a farmer working every day for hours saying not a word cutting off the ripe at the top of his speed as if employed by the job and examining every branch in regular order as if careful that not one should escape him then descending he stores them away beneath logs and in anticipation of the hunger days of winter he seems himself a kind of fruit â both fruit and flower the of the pines every the mountains of pore of his body and eating flesh is like one never of this bright of nature â this brave little voice crying in the wilderness â of observing his many works and ways and listening to his curious language his musical gossip is as to the ear as to the and though he has not exactly the gift of song some of his notes are as sweet as those of a â almost like in softness while others and hke he is the mocking bird of pouring forth mixed chatter and song like a fountain barking like a dog screaming like a hawk like a or a while in bluff audacious he is a very in descending the trunk of a tree with the intention of on the ground he preserves a cautious silence perhaps of and but while rocking safely at home in the pine tops there is no end to his and noise and woe to the gray or that to set foot on his favorite tree no matter how they trace the of the bark they are speedily discovered and kicked down stairs with comic vehemence while a torrent of angry notes comes rushing from his lips that sounds remarkably like swearing he will even attempt at times to drive away dogs and men especially if he has had no previous knowledge of them seeing a man for the time he approaches nearer and nearer until within a few feet then with an angry outburst he makes a the sudden rash all te th and eyes 
83,as if about to eat you up but finding that the big animal does ut scare he beats a retreat and sets himself up to on some overhanging branch every movement you make gathering courage he down the trunk again and and nervously up and down in curious you all the time as if showing off and demanding your admiration finally gi owing calmer he settles down in a comfortable posture on some branch commanding a good view and beats time with his tail to a steady up up i or when somewhat less excited ah with the first syllable keenly and the second drawn out like the scream of a hawk â repeating this slowly and more emphatically at first then gi faster until a i ate of about words a minute is reached usually sitting all the time on his with resting on his breast which visibly with each word it is remarkable too that though distinctly he keeps his mouth shut most of the time and speaks through his nose i have occasionally observed him even eating seeds and a troublesome track once and a t when showing a the mountains of without ceasing or in any way his ah ah for a single moment while ascending trees all his claws come into play but in descending the weight of his body is sustained chiefly by those of the hind feet stiu in neither case do his movements suggest effort though if you are near enough you may see the strength of his short bear like arms and note his in bark whether going up or down he carries his tail extended at full length in line with his body unless it be required for gestures but while running along limbs or fallen trunks it is frequently folded forward over the back with the airy tip in cool weather it keeps him warm then after he has his meal you may see him crouched close on some level limb with his tail robe neatly spread and reaching forward to his ears the electric hairs quivering in the breeze like pine needles but in wet or very cold weather he stays in his nest and while curled up there his is long enough to come forward around his nose it is seldom so cold however as to prevent his going out to his stores when hungry once as i lay storm bound on the upper edge of the timber line on mount the nearly at and the sky thick with driving snow a came bravely out several times from one of the lower hollows of a dwarf pine near my camp faced the wind without seeming to feel it much lightly about over the snow and dug his way down to some hidden seeds with wonder the fill precision as if to his eyes the thick were glass no other of the animals of my acquaintance is better fed not even the deer amid abundance of sweet and shrubs or the mountain sheep or bears his food consists of grass seeds nuts and the nuts and seeds of all the trees without exception â pine fir and â he is fond of them all and they all agree with him green or ripe no is too large for him to manage none so small as to be beneath his notice the smaller ones such as those of the and the and the two pine he cuts and eats on a branch of the tree without allowing them to fall beginning at the bottom of the and cutting away the scales to expose the seeds not by guess like a bear but turning them round and round in regular order in compliance with their arrangement when thus employed his in the tree is betrayed by a of scales shells and and every few minutes by the fall of the stripped of the then of course he is ready for another and if you are watching you may catch a glimpse of him as he silently out to the end of a branch and see him examining the clusters until he finds one to his mind then leaning over pull back the needles out of his way grasp the with his to prevent its falling it off in an short time seize it with jaws stretched and the of to his seat near the trunk but the immense size of the of the sugar pine â from fifteen to twenty inches in length â and those of the variety of the yellow pine compel him to adopt a quite different method he cats them without attempting to hold them then goes down and them from where they have chanced to fall up to the bare swelling ground around the of the tree where he them iu the same way beginning at the bottom and following the to the top from a single sugar pine he gets from two to four hundred seeds about half the size of a so that in a few minutes he can procure enough to last a week he seems however to prefer those of the two silver first above all others perhaps because they are most easily obtained as the scales drop off when ripe without to be cut both species are filled with an exceedingly oil seeds scale of all and is of itself sufficient to account for his lightning energy you may easily know this little his on sunny around the principal trees they lie in big piles â and the of them all fresh and clean making the most beautiful kitchen imaginable the brown and yellow scales and nut shells are as abundant and as delicately and tinted as the shells along the sea shore while the beautiful red and purple seed wings mingled with them would lead one to fancy that innumerable had there met their fate he on all the species long before they are ripe but is wise enough 
83,to wait until they are before he them into his this is in october and november which with him are the two months of the year all kinds of big and little are now cut off and down alike and the ground is speedily covered with them a constant and is kept up some of the larger to fall on old logs make the forest with the sound other nut less industrious know well what is going on and hasten to carry away the as they fall but however busy the may be he is not slow to the below and instantly leaves his work to drive them away the little striped is a thorn in his flesh stealing persistently punish him as he may the large gray gives trouble also although the has been accused of stealing from him generally however just the opposite is the case the excellence of the is well known to throughout the world consequently there is considerable demand for the seeds the greater portion of the supply has hitherto been procured by down the trees the mountains of in the more accessible sections of the forest alongside of bridle paths that cross the range seeds at first brought from twenty to thirty dollars per pound and therefore were eagerly sought after some of the smaller fruitful trees were cut down in the groves not protected by government especially those of and king s river most of the however are of so gigantic a size that the have to look for the greater portion of their supplies to the who soon he is no match for these he is wise enough however to cease working the instant he them and never fails to embrace every opportunity to recover his whenever they happen to be stored in any place accessible to him and the busy often finds on returning to camp that the little has spoiled the i know one seed who whenever ho the wheat or beneath the trees as conscience money the want of life remarked by so many in the forests is never felt at this time of year banish all the humming insects and the birds and leaving only sir and the most solitary of our so called would still throb with ardent life but if you should go impatiently even into the most of the groves on purpose to meet him and walk about looking up among the branches you would see very little of him but lie down at the foot of one of the trees and straightway he will come for in the midst of the ordinary forest sounds the falling of of the the screaming of the crow and the rustling of deer and bears among the he is quick to detect your strange footsteps and will hasten to make a good close inspection of you as soon as you are still first you may hear him sounding a few notes of curious inquiry but more likely the first intimation of his approach will be the sounds of his feet as he the tree overhead just before he makes his savage to frighten you and proclaim your presence to every and bird in the neighborhood if you remain perfectly motionless he will come nearer and nearer and probably set your flesh a by across your body once while i was seated at the foot of a in one of the most inaccessible of the san engaged in a reckless fellow came up behind me passed under my arm and jumped on my paper and one warm afternoon while an old friend of mine was reading out in the shade of his cabin one of his neighbors jumped from the upon his head and then with admirable assurance ran down over his shoulder and on to the book he held in his hand our a large social circle for besides his numerous relatives t s he intimate relations with the nut eating birds particularly the crow and the numerous and the two are abundant in the and lower foot hills but more and more the mountains of distributed up through the â seldom venturing higher than six or seven thousand feet above the level of the sea the gray but little higher than this the little striped alone is associated with him everywhere in the lower and middle where they all meet they are tolerably harmonious â a happy family though very amusing may occasionally be witnessed wherever the ancient have spread forest soil there you find our hero most abundant where depth of soil and genial climate have given rise to a corresponding in the trees but following every kind of growth up the to the highest fountains though i cannot of course expect all my readers to fully in my admiration of this little animal few i hope will think this sketch of his life too long i cannot begin to tell here how much he has cheered my lonely wanderings during all the years i have been pursuing my studies in these glorious or how much unmistakable humanity i have found in him take this for example one calm indian summer morning when the nuts were ripe i was in the upper of the south fork of the san where the seemed to be about as plentiful as the ripe they were taking an early breakfast before going to their regular harvest work while i was busy with my own breakfast i heard the fall of two or three heavy from a pine near me i stole noiselessly forward within about twenty feet of the base of it to ob the serve in a few moments down came the the breakfast he had cut off had rolled on the gently sloping ground into a of bushes but he seemed to know exactly where they were for he found them at once apparently without searching for them they were more than twice as heavy as himself but 
84,after turning them into the right position for getting a good hold with his long teeth he managed to drag them up to the foot of the tree from which he had cut them moving backward then himself comfortably he held them on end bottom up and them at his ease a good deal of had to be done before he got anything to eat because the lower scales are barren but when he had patiently worked his way up to the fertile ones he found two sweet nuts at the base of each shaped like trimmed and spotted purple like birds eggs and notwithstanding these were dripping with soft and covered with and so strongly put together that a boy would be puzzled to cut them open with a he accomplished his meal with easy dignity and cleanliness making less effort apparently than a man would in eating soft from a plate breakfast done i whistled a tune for him before he went to work curious to see how he would be affected by it he had not seen me all this while but the instant i began to whistle he darted up the tree nearest to him and came out on a small dead limb opposite me and composed himself to listen i sang and whistled more than a dozen airs and as the music changed his eyes sparkled and the mountains op he turned bis head quickly from side to side but made no other response other hearing the strange sounds came around on all sides also and birds one of the birds a handsome seemed even more interested than the after listening for awhile on one of the lower dead of a pine he came forward within a few feet of my face and remained fluttering in the air for half a minute or so himself with wing beats like a humming bird in front of a flower while i could look into his eyes and see his innocent wonder by this time my performance must have lasted nearly half an hour i sang or whistled o o er the water to woods o lee etc all of which seemed to be listened to with bright interest my first sitting patiently through it all with his telling eyes fixed upon me until i ed to give the old when he screamed his name turned tail and darted with ludicrous haste up the tree out of sight his voice and actions in the case leaving a somewhat profane impression as if he had said i be hanged if you get me to hear anything so solemn and this acted as a signal for the general of the whole hairy tribe though the birds seemed willing to wait further music being naturally more in their line what there can be in that grand old church tune that is so offensive to birds and i cant the imagine a year or two after this high concert i was sitting one fine day on a hill in the coast where the common ground were abundant they were very shy on account of being hunted so much but after i had been silent and motionless for half an hour or so they began to venture out of their holes and to feed on the seeds of the and around me as if i were no more to be feared than a tree stump then it occurred to me that this was a good opportunity to find out whether they also disliked old therefore i began to whistle as nearly as i could remember the same familiar airs that had pleased the of the they at once stopped eating stood erect and listened patiently until i came to old when with ludicrous haste every one of them rushed to their holes and bolted in their feet twinkling in the air for a moment as they vanished no one who makes the acquaintance of our will fail to admire him but he is far too and warlike ever to be taken for a darling how long the life of a may be i don t know the young seem to from knot holes perfect from the first and as enduring as their own trees it is difficult indeed to realize that so a piece of sun fire should ever become dim or die at all he is seldom killed by hunters for he is too small to encourage much of their attention and when pursued in settled regions becomes excessively shy and keeps close in the of the highest trunks many of which are of the same color as himself indian boys however the mountains of lie in wait with patience to shoot them with in the lower and middle a few fall a prey to occasionally he is pursued by and etc but upon the whole he dwells safely in the deep bosom of the woods the most highly favored of all his happy tribe may his tribe increase chapter x a in the forests the mountain winds like the dew and rain sunshine and snow are measured and bestowed with love on the forests to develop their strength and beauty however the scope of other forest influences that of the winds is universal the snow and the upper forests every winter the lightning strikes a single tree here and there while down thousands at a as a gardener out a bed of flowers but the winds go to every tree every leaf and branch and not one is forgotten the mountain pine towering with outstretched arms on the rugged of the icy peaks the and most retiring tenant of the they seek and find them all caressing them tenderly bending them in exercise their growth off a leaf or limb as required or removing an entire tree or gi now whispering and through the branches like a sleepy child now roaring like the ocean the winds blessing the forests the forests 
84,the winds with beauty and harmony as the sm e result after one has seen pines six feet in bending like gi before a gale and a wind storm in the forests ever and anon some giant falling with a crash that shakes the hills it seems astonishing that any save the lowest trees could ever have found a period sufficiently to establish themselves or once established that they should not the mountains of sooner or later have been blown down but when the storm is over and we behold the same forests tranquil again towering fresh and in erect majesty and consider what centuries of storms have fallen upon them since they were first planted â hail to break the tender lightning to and snow winds and to crush and â while the manifest result of all this wild storm culture is the glorious perfection we behold then faith in nature s is established and we cease to the violence of her most destructive or of any other storm whatsoever there are two trees in the forests that are never blown down so long as they continue in sound health these are the and the dwarf pine of the summit peaks their stiff crooked roots grip the storm beaten like claws while their cord like branches bend round offering but slight holds for winds however violent the other â the needle pine mountain pine two pine and â are never out by this agent to any destructive extent on account of their admirable and the of their growth in general the same is true of the giants of the lower the sugar pine towering aloft to a height of more than feet offers a fine mark to storm winds but it is not and its long arms swing round in the blast like of green in a brook while the silver in most places keep their ranks well together a wind in the forests in united strength the yellow or silver pine is more frequently than any other tree on the because its leaves and branches form â a larger mass in proportion to its height while in many places it is planted leaving open lanes through which storms may enter with full force because it is distributed along the lower portion of the range which was the first to be left bare on the breaking up of the ice sheet at the close of the winter the soil it is gi owing upon has been longer exposed to post and consequently is in a more crumbling decayed condition than the farther up the range and therefore offers a less secure for the roots while exploring the forest of mount i discovered the path of a strewn with thousands of pines of this species great and small had been or off by sheer force making a clean gap like that made by a snow but capable of doing this class of work are rare in the and when we have the forests from one extremity of the range to the other we are compelled to believe that they are the most beautiful on the face of the earth however we may regard the agents that have made them so there is always something deeply exciting not only in the sounds of winds in the woods which exert more or less influence over every mind but in their varied flow as manifested by the movements of the trees especially those of the by no other trees are they rendered so the mountains of and visible not even by the palms or tree to the breeze the waving of a forest of the giant is impressive and but the pines seem to me the best of winds they are mighty waving ever in tune singing and writing wind music all their long century lives little however of this noble tree waving and tree music will you see or hear in the strictly portion of the forests the whose sometimes more than equals itâ height is about as rigid as the rocks on which it grows the slender lash like of the dwarf pine stream out in wavering but the and are far too to wave even in the heaviest they only shake in quick short the however and the mountain pine and some of the of the two species bow in storms with considerable scope and but it is only in the lower and middle that the meeting of winds and woods is to be seen in all its one of the most beautiful and storms i ever enjoyed in the occurred in december when i happened to be exploring one of the valleys of the the sky and the ground and the trees had been thoroughly rain washed and were dry again the day was intensely pure one of those bits of winter warm and and full of white sparkling sunshine of all the purest influences of the spring and at the same time en a wind storm in the forests with one of the most wind storms conceivable instead of out as i usually do i then chanced to be stopping at the house of a friend but when the storm began to sound i lost no time in pushing out into the woods to enjoy it for on such occasions nature has always something rare to show us and the danger to life and limb is hardly greater than one would experience crouching beneath a roof it was still early morning when i found myself fairly adrift delicious sunshine came pouring over the hills lighting the tops of the pines and setting free a steam of f ance that contrasted strangely with the wild tones of the storm the air was with pine and bright green that went flashing past in the sunlight like birds pursued but there was not the slightest nothing less pure than leaves and ripe and of withered and moss i heard trees falling 
84,for hours at the rate of one every two or three minutes some partly on account of the loose water soaked condition of the ground others broken straight across where some weakness caused by fire had determined the spot the gestures of the various trees made a delightful study young sugar pines light and as tails were bowing almost to the ground while the grand old whose massive had been tried in a hundred storms waved solemnly above them their long branches streaming on the gale and eveiy needle thrilling and ringing and shedding off keen of light like a the mountains of the with long drawn out in level and needles in a gray glow presented a most striking appearance as they stood in bold relief along the the in the with their red bark and large glossy leaves every way reflected the sunshine in throbbing like those one so often sees on the surface of a lake but the silver pines were now the most beautiful of all colossal feet in height waved like and bowing low as if in worship while the whole mass of their long tremulous foliage was kindled into one continuous blaze of white sun fire the force of the gale was such that the most steadfast monarch of them all rocked down to its roots with a motion plainly perceptible when one leaned against it nature was holding high festival and every of the most rigid giants thrilled with glad excitement i drifted on through the midst of this passionate music and motion across many a from ridge to ridge often halting in the lee of a rock for shelter or to gaze and listen even when the grand had swelled to its highest pitch i could distinctly hear the varying tones of individual trees â and fir and pine and oak â and even the infinitely gentle rustle of the withered at my feet each was expressing itself in its own way â singing its own song and making its own peculiar gestures â a richness of variety to be found in no other forest i have yet seen the woods of canada a wind storm in the and the and are made up of trees that resemble one another about as nearly as blades of grass and grow close together in much the same way trees in general seldom possess individual character such as is manifest among oaks and elms but the forests are made up of a greater number of distinct species than any other in the world and in them we find not only a marked into special groups but also a marked individuality in almost every tree giving rise to storm effects glorious toward midday after a long scramble through of and i gained the summit of the highest ridge in the neighborhood and then it occurred to me that it would be a fine thing to climb one of the trees to obtain a wider outlook and get my ear close to the music of its needles but under the circumstances the choice of a tree was a serious matter one whose was not very strong seemed in danger of being blown down or of being struck by others in case they should fall another was to a considerable height above the ground and at the same time too large to be grasped with arms and legs in climbing while others were not situated for clear views after cautiously casting about i made choice of the of a group of that were growing close together like a of grass no one of which seemed likely to fall unless all the rest fell with it though comparatively young they were about feet high and their the mountains of tops were rocking and in wild ecstasy being accustomed to climb trees in making studies i experienced no difficulty in reaching the top of this one and never before did i enjoy so noble an of motion the slender tops fairly and in the passionate torrent bending and backward and forward round and round tracing indescribable of and curves while i clung with muscles firm like a on a reed in its sweeps my tree top described an arc of from twenty to thirty degrees but i felt sure of its elastic temper having seen others of the same species still more severely tried â bent almost to the ground indeed in heavy â without breaking a i was therefore safe and free to take the wind into my and enjoy the excited forest from my superb outlook the view from here must be extremely beautiful in any weather now my eye over the hills and as over fields of waving grain and felt the light running in and broad swelling across the valleys from ridge to ridge as the shining foliage was stirred by corresponding waves of air these waves of reflected light would break up suddenly into a kind of beaten foam and again after chasing one another in regular order they would seem to bend forward in curves and disappear on some like sea waves on a shore the quantity of light reflected from the bent needles was so great as to make whole groves appear as if a wind storm in the f best covered with snow while the black shadows beneath the trees greatly the effect of the silvery splendor excepting only the shadows there was nothing in all this wild sea of pines on the contrary notwithstanding this was the winter season the colors were remarkably beautiful the shafts of the pine and were brown and purple and most of the foliage was well tinged with yellow the laurel groves with the pale of their leaves turned upward made masses of gray and then there was many a dash of color from of and jet of vivid crimson from the bark of the while the ground on the appearing here and there through between 
84,the groves displayed masses of pale purple and brown the sounds of the storm with this wild of light and motion the profound bass of the naked branches and like the quick tense of the pine needles now rising to a shrill whistling hiss now falling to a murmur the rustling of laurel groves in the and the keen click of leaf on leaf â all this was heard in easy analysis when the attention was calmly bent the varied gestures of the multitude were seen to fine advantage so that one could recognize the different species at a distance of several miles by this means alone as well as by their forms and colors and the way they reflected the light all seemed strong and comfortable as if really enjoy v the mountains of ing the storm while to its most enthusiastic greetings we hear much nowadays concerning the universal struggle for existence but no struggle in the common meaning of the word was manifest here no recognition of danger by any tree no but rather an invincible gladness as remote from exultation as from fear i kept my lofty perch for hours frequently closing my eyes to enjoy the music by itself or to feast quietly on the delicious fragrance that was streaming past the fragrance of the woods was less marked than that produced during warm rain when so many and leaves are like tea but from the of branches against each other and the incessant of of needles the gale was to a very degree and besides the fragrance from these local sources there were traces of brought from afar for this wind came first from the sea against its fresh waves then through the rich and spreading itself in broad over many a flower ridge of the coast mountains then across the golden plains up the purple foot hills and into these woods with the varied incense gathered by the way winds are of all they touch however much or little we may be able to read them telling their wanderings even by their alone detect the perfume of d winds far at sea and sea winds carry the fragrance of and far inland where it is a wind storm in the forests â quickly recognized though mingled with the of a thousand land flowers as an illustration of this i may tell here that i breathed sea air on the of forth in scotland while a boy then was taken to where i remained nineteen years then without in all this time having breathed one breath of the sea i walked quietly alone from the middle of the valley to the gulf of on a excursion and while in far from the coast my attention wholly bent on the splendid tropical vegetation about me i suddenly recognized a as it came through the and blooming vine which at once awakened and set free a thousand associations and made me a boy again in scotland as if all the intervening years had been most people like to look at mountain rivers and bear them in mind but few care to look at the winds though far more beautiful and sublime and though they become at times about as visible as flowing water when the north winds in winter are making upward sweeps over the of the high the fact is sometimes published with flying snow a mile long those portions of the winds thus embodied can scarce be wholly invisible even to the darkest imagination and when we look around over an agitated forest we may see something of the wind that it by its effects upon the trees yonder it in a rush of water like and sweeps over the bending pines from hill to hill nearer we see detached and leaves now by on the mountains op level currents now whirling in or escaping over the edges of the soaring aloft on grand of air or tossing on flame like smooth deep currents falls and sing around every tree and leaf and over all the varied of the region with telling changes of form like mountain rivers to the features of their channels after tracing the streams from their fountains to the plains marking where they bloom white in falls glide in crystal gray and foam filled in choked and slip through the woods in long tranquil reaches â after thus learning their language and forms in detail we may at length hear them all together in one grand and comprehend them all in clear inner vision covering the range like lace but even this spectacle is far less sublime and not a whit more substantial than what we may behold of these storm streams of air in the mountain woods we all travel the way together trees and men but it never occurred to me until this while swinging in the wind that trees are in the ordinary sense they make many journeys not extensive ones it is true but our own little journeys away and back again are only httle more than tree â many of them not so much when the storm began to i dismounted and sauntered down through the woods the storm tones died away and turning toward the east i beheld the countless hosts of the forests hushed and tranquil towering above one another a wind storm in the forests on the slopes of the hills like a devout audience the setting sun filled them with light and seemed to say while they listened my peace i give unto you as i gazed on the impressive scene all the ruin of the storm was forgotten and never before did these noble woods appear so fresh so joyous so immortal chapter xi the river floods the rivers are every spring by the melting of the snow as regularly as the famous old they begin to rise in may and in june high water mark is reached but because 
85,the melting does not go on rapidly over all the fountains high and low simultaneously and the melted snow is not at this time of year by rain the spring floods are seldom very violent or destructive the thousand falls however and the in the are then in full bloom and sing songs from one end of the range to the other of course the snow on the lower of the rivers is first melted then that on the higher fountains most exposed to sunshine and about a month later the cooler shadowy fountains send down their treasures thus allowing the main trunk streams nearly six weeks to get their waters hurried through the foot hills and across the to the sea therefore very violent spring floods are avoided and will be as long as the forests last the rivers of the north half of the range are still less subject to sudden floods because their upper fountains in great part lie protected from the changes of râ the river floods the weather beneath thick folds of just as many of the rivers of lie beneath folds of ice coming to the light farther down the range in large springs while those of the high lie on the surface of solid granite exposed to every change of temperature more than ninety per cent of the water derived from the snow and ice of mount is at once absorbed and drained away beneath the folds of the mountain where and groping in the dark they at length find larger and like from which they and cool in the form of large springs some of them so large they give birth to rivers that set out on their journeys beneath the sun without any visible period of childhood thus the issues from a large lake like spring in valley and about two thirds of the volume of the forth suddenly from the face of a bluff in a roaring spring seventy five yards wide these spring rivers of the north are of course shorter than those of the south whose extend up to the tops of the mountains fall an important of the or upper is only about ten miles long and is all falls and springs from its head to its with the springs issue from the rocks at one end of it a snowy fall a hundred and eighty feet high at the other and a rush of crystal sing and dance between of course such streams are but little affected by the weather sheltered the mountains op from their flow is nearly as full in the autumn as in the time of general spring floods while those of the high to less than the part of their prime in autumn to a series of silent pools among the rocks and hollows of their channels connected by feeble creeping threads of water like the sentences of a tired writer by a of and strange to say the greatest floods occur in winter when one would suppose all the wild waters would be muffled and chained in frost and snow the same long all day storms of the so called rainy season in that give rain to the give dry fix snow to the mountains but at rare intervals warm rains and winds the mountains and push back the snow line from feet to or even higher and then come the big floods i was usually driven down out of the high about the end of november but the winter of and was so warm and calm that i was tempted to seek general views of the and of the basin of feather river in january and i had just completed a hasty survey of the region and made my way down to winter quarters when one of the flood storms that i ever saw broke on the mountains i was then in the edge of the main forest belt at a small foot hill town called on the divide between the waters of the feather and rivers the cause of this notable flood was simply a sudden and copious fall of warm wind and rain on the the floods of these rivers at a time when they contained a considerable quantity of snow the rain was so heavy and long sustained that it was of itself sufficient to make a good wild flood while the snow which the warm wind and rain melted on the upper and middle regions of the was sufficient to make another flood equal to that of the rain now these two distinct of flood waters were gathered simultaneously and poured out on the plain in one magnificent the of the and feather like many others of the are admirably adapted to the growth of floods of this kind their many far and wide extensive and the are inclined while the trunks are comparatively level while the flood storm was in progress the at ranged between and and when warm wind and warm rain fall simultaneously on snow contained in like these both the rain and that portion of the snow which the rain and wind melt are at first up and held back until the combined mass becomes which at length suddenly slips and all together to the trunk channel and since the deeper the stream the faster it flows the portion of the above the slower foot hill portion below it and all sweeping forward together with a high front on the open plain with a violence and suddenness that at first seem wholly unaccountable the of the lower portion of this particular flood was somewhat by the mountains of gravel in the river channels and by which gave way after having at first restrained and held back the waters these conditions did not however greatly influence the general result the main effect having been caused by the rare combination of flood indicated above it is a pity that but few people meet and 
85,enjoy storms so noble as this in their homes in the mountains for spending themselves in the open of the plains they are likely to be remembered more by the bridges and houses they carry away than by their beauty or the thousand blessings they bring to the and gardens of nature on the morning of the flood january th all the feather and were covered with running water muddy torrents filled every and and the sky was thick with rain the pines had long been sleeping in sunshine they were now awake roaring and waving with the beating storm and the winds sweeping along the curves of hill and streaming through the woods and on the tops of rocky made the wildest of wild storm melody it was easy to see that only a small part of the rain reached the ground in the form of drops most of it was into dusty spray like that into which small are divided when they dash on rocks never have i seen water coming from the sky in or more passionate streams the wind chased the spray forward in choking and compelled me again and again to seek shelter in the and back of large trees to rest and catch my breath wherever i the river floods went on or in hollows enthusiastic water still flashed and about my ankles recalling a wild winter flood in when a hundred came and together and filled the grand valley with a sea like roar after drifting an hour or two in the lower woods i set out for the summit of a hill feet high with a view to getting as near the heart of the storm as possible in order to reach it i had to cross dry creek a of the that goes crawling along the base of the hill on the it was now a river as large as the at ordinary stages its current brown with washed down from many a claim and with boxes fence rails and logs that had long lain above its reach a slim foot bridge stretched across it now scarcely above the swollen current here i was glad to linger gazing and listening while the storm was in its richest mood â the gray rain flood above the brown river flood beneath the language of the river was scarcely less than that of the wind and rain the sublime of the main current the and of the the keen dash and clash of heavy waves breaking against rocks and the smooth hush of shallow currents feeling their way through the willow of the margin and amid au this varied throng of sounds i heard the smothered and of on the bottom as they were and rolling forward against one another in a wild rush after having lain still for probably years or more the mountains of the glad creek rose high above its banks and wandered from its channel out over many a sand flat and meadow and were bearing up against the current with nervous trembling gestures as if afraid of being carried away while branches bending dipped lightly and rose again as if the wild waters in play leaving the bridge and passing on through the storm woods all the ground seemed to be moving pine of bark soil leaves and broken branches were being swept forward and many a rock fragment from exposed was now ng its first and in the wild streams of the storm on they rushed through every and hollow leaping gliding working with a will and rejoicing like living creatures was the flood confined to the ground every tree had a water system of its own spreading far and wide like miniature and midday cloud wind and rain reached their highest development the storm was in full bloom and formed from my commanding outlook on the one of the most glorious views i ever beheld as far as the eye could reach above beneath around wind driven rain the air uke one vast detached clouds swept up the valley as if they were endowed with independent motion and had special work to do in the mountain wells now rising above the pine tops now descending into their midst their and soothing every branch and leaf with gentleness in the midst of all the floods the savage sound and motion others keeping near the ground glided behind separate groves and brought them forward into relief with admirable distinctness or passing in front whole groves in succession pine after pine melting in their gray and bursting forth again seemingly clearer than before the forms of storms are in gi eat part measured and controlled by the of the regions where they rise and over which they pass when therefore we attempt to study them from the valleys or from and of the forest we are confounded by a multitude of separate and apparently impressions the bottom of the storm is broken up into innumerable waves and currents that against the like sea waves against a shore and these on the surface of the storm immense hollows and and sweep forward the in long trains like the of but as we ascend these partial effects disappear and the phenomena are beheld united and harmonious the longer i gazed into the storm the more plainly visible it became the drifting cloud gave it a kind of visible body which explained many phenomena and published its movements in plain terms while the texture of the falling mass of rain rounded it out and rendered it more complete because differ in size they fall at different and overtake and clash against one another producing mist and spray they also of course yield unequal the mountains of compliance to the force of the which gives rise to a still greater degree of interference and passionate sweep off clouds of spray from the groves like that torn from wave tops in a gale all these 
85,of in color and e of the general rain mass tend to make it the more and telling it is then seen as one grand flood rushing over bank and bending the pines like weeds this way and that whirling in huge in hollows and while the main over au like ocean currents over the that he hidden at the bottom of the sea i watched the gestures of the pines while the storm was at its height and it was easy to see that they were not distressed several large sugar pines stood near the thicket in which i was sheltered bowing solemnly and tossing their long arms as if the very words of the storm while accepting its wildest with passionate the lions were feeding those who have observed on sunshine during the golden days of indian summer know that none of their gestures express their celestial food is too heartily given too heartily taken to leave room for thanks the pines were evidently accepting the of the storm in the same whole manner and when i looked down among the and still lower to the young and on the rocks i noticed the same divine methods of giving and taking and the same exquisite of what seems an outbreak of violent and the river floods force to the purposes of beautiful and delicate life like sleep come upon just as they do on people and trees and storms awaken them in the same way in the dry of the lower portion of the range the withered hills and valleys seem to lie as empty and as dead shells on a shore even the highest mountains may be found occasionally dull and as if in some way they had lost countenance and shrunk to less than half their real stature but when the crash and echo in the and the clouds come down wi and crowning their bald snowy heads every feature beams with expression and they rise again in all their imposing majesty storms are fine and tell all they know but their voices of lightning torrent and rushing wind are much less numerous than the nameless still small voices too low for human ears and because we are poor listeners we fail to catch much that is fairly within reach our best rains are heard mostly on roofs and winds in chimneys and when by choice or we are pushed into the heart of a storm the confusion made by and nervous haste and mean fear prevent our hearing any other than the expressions yet we may draw en from storm sounds that are beyond hear ing and storm movements we cannot see the sublime whirl of around their is as silent as in the dark among the roots of plants in this great storm as in every other there were tones and gestures the mountains of gentle manifested in the midst of what is called violence and fury but easily recognized by all who look and listen for them the rain brought out the colors of the woods with delightful freshness the rich brown of the bark of the trees and the fallen and leaves and dead the of rocks and the light purple of swelling and the warm yellow of the and the air was steaming with delightful fragrance not rising and past in separate masses but diffused through all the atmosphere pine woods are always fragrant but most so in spring when the young are opening and in warm weather when the various and are softened by the sun the wind was now their innumerable needles and the warm rain was them grows here in large beds in the and there is plenty of laurel in and on the and the rosy fragrant carpets the ground almost everywhere these with the and of the woods form the main local fragrance fountains of the storm the ascending clouds of wind rolled and rain washed became pure like light and with the wind as part of it toward the middle of the afternoon the main flood cloud lifted along its western border revealing a beautiful section of the valley some twenty or thirty miles away brilliantly sim lighted and with rain sheets as if paved with silver soon afterward a jagged bluff like cloud with a sheer face appeared over the valley of the dark colored and with numerous the floods like some huge table the blue coast range was seen stretching along the sky like a wall and the rose out of the plain like islands out of the sea then the rain began to and i sauntered down through the dripping bushes in the universal vigor and freshness that inspired all the life about me how clean and and immortal the woods seemed to be â the lofty in full bloom laden with golden and their washed shining the pines rocking gently and settling back into rest and the evening on the broad leaves of the their of yellow boughs relieved against dusky of chestnut oak were in glorious revival and every moss that had ever lived seemed to be coming crowding back from the dead to clothe each trunk and stone in living green the steaming ground seemed fairly to throb and with life and young were pushing up as if already conscious of the summer glory and innumerable green and yellow were peeping and everywhere as for the birds and not a wing or tail of them was to be seen while the storm was blowing dislike wet weather more than cats do therefore they were at home rocking in their dry nests the birds were hiding in the out of the wind some of the strongest of them at and but most were perched on low twigs their breast feathers puffed the mountains op out and keeping one another company through the hard time as best they could when i arrived at the village about the good people themselves pitying 
85,my condition as if i were some snatched from the sea while i in turn warm with excitement and like the ground pitied them for being dry and of all the glory that nature had spread round about them that day chapter xii the weather of spring and summer in the middle region of the is usually well with rains and light of snow most of which are far too obviously joyful and life giving to be regarded as storms and in the picturesque beauty and clearness of outlines of their clouds they offer striking to those boundless cloud of the storms of winter the smallest and most perfectly specimens present a richly cloud rising above the dark woods about a m swelling with a visible motion straight up into the calm sunny sky to a height of to feet above the sea its white relieved by gray and pale purple shadows in the hollows and showing outlines as keenly defined as those of the polished in less than an hour it full development and stands poised in the blazing sunshine like some colossal mountain as beautiful in form and finish as if it were to become a permanent addition to the landscape presently a through the crisp air ringing like steel on steel sharp and clear its startling breaking into a spray of echoes against the mountains op the cliffs and walls then down comes a of rain the big drops through the pine needles and on the granite and pour down the sides of and in a of gray in a few minutes the cloud to a of dim and leaving the sky perfectly clear and bright every dust wiped and washed out of it everything is refreshed and a steam of fragrance rises and the stolen is finished â one cloud one lightning stroke and one dash of rain this is the thunder storm reduced to its lowest terms but some of them attain much larger proportions and assume a grandeur and energy of expression hardly surpassed by those bred in the depths of winter producing those sudden floods called cloud bursts which are local and to a considerable extent for they appear nearly every day about the same time for weeks usually about eleven o clock and lasting from five minutes to an hour or two one soon becomes so accustomed to see them that the noon sky seems empty and abandoned without them as if nature were forgetting something when the glorious pearl and clouds of these storms are being built i never give attention to anything else no mountain or mountain range however clothed with light has a more enduring charm than those fleeting mountains of the sky â floating fountains bearing water for every well the angels of the streams and lakes brooding in the deep or sweeping softly along the ground over ridge and thunder storms dome over meadow over forest over garden and grove lingering with shadows refreshing every flower and soothing rugged rock brows with a gentleness of touch and e wholly divine the most beautiful and imposing of the summer storms rise just above the upper edge of the silver fir and all are so beautiful that it is not easy to choose any one for particular description the one that i remember best fell on the mountains near valley july while i was in the silver fir woods a range of took possession of the sky huge and peaks rising one beyond another with deep between them bending this way and that in long curves and reaches interrupted here and there with white masses that looked like the spray of of lightning followed each other in quick succession and the thunder was so loud and massive it seemed as if surely an entire mountain was being shattered at every stroke only the trees were touched however so far as i could see â a few feet high perhaps and five to six feet in were split into long rails and from top to bottom and scattered to all points of the compass then came the rain in a hearty flood covering the ground and making it shine with a continuous sheet of water that like a transparent or skin fitted closely down over all the rugged of the landscape it is not long speaking since the first fell on the present of the and in the few of thousands of years the op of stormy cultivation they have been with how beautiful they have become i the first rains fell on raw crumbling and rocks without a plant now scarcely a drop can fail to find a beautiful mark on the tops of the peaks on the smooth on the curves of the on full of on the thousand forms of with their tender beauty of vegetation some softly on meadows creeping out of sight seeking and finding every thirsty some through the of the woods in dust through the needles and whispering good cheer to each of them some falling with blunt tapping sounds on the broad leaves of some falling straight into fragrant kissing the lips of lilies on the sides of on shining of gold some falling into the fountains of snow to swell their well saved stores some into the lakes and rivers patting the smooth making and bells and spray washing the mountain windows washing the wandering winds some into the heart of snowy falls and as if eager to join in the dance and the song and beat the foam yet finer good work and happy work for the merry mountain each one of them a brave fall in itself rushing from the cliffs and hollows of the clouds into the cliffs and hollows of the mountains away from the thunder of the sky into the thunder of the roaring rivers and how far they have to go and how many cups thunder storms to fill â cups a drop and lake 
86,between the hills each with equal care â every drop god s messenger sent on its way with glorious pomp and display of power â silvery new born stars with lake and river mountain and valley â all that the landscape holds â reflected in their crystal depths chapter the water the of the are frequented one â the or water i he is a singularly joyous and little fellow about the size of a tv bin clad in a plain suit of with a of on the head and shoulders in form he is about as smoothly plump and th mj ct as a that has been whirled in a t hole the flowing of his body being interrupted only by his strong feet and bill the crisp wing tips and the up like tail all the countless i have met in the se of ten years in whether among the icy peaks or warm foot hills or in the of the middle region not one was found without its no is too cold for this little bird none too lonely provided it be rich in falling water find a fall or or rushing rapid anywhere upon a clear stream and there you will surely find its y flitting about in the spray in foaming whirling like a leaf among beaten foam bells ever vigorous and enthusiastic yet and neither seeking nor company the if disturbed while dipping about in the margin he either off with a rapid to some other feeding ground up or down the stream or on some half rock or out in the and immediately begins to nod and courtesy like a turning his head from side to side with many other odd dainty move the mountains of ments that never fail to fix the attention of the observer he is the mountain streams own darling the humming bird of blooming waters loving rocky ripple slopes and sheets of foam as a bee loves flowers as a lark loves sunshine and meadows among all the mountain birds none has cheered me so much in my lonely wanderings â none so for both in winter and summer he sings sweetly cheerily independent alike of sunshine and of love requiring no other inspiration than the stream on which he dwells while water sings so must he in heat or cold calm or storm ever his voice in sure accord low in the of summer and the of winter but never silent during the golden days of indian summer after most of the snow has been melted and the mountain streams have become feeble â a succession of silent pools linked together by shallow transparent currents and of silvery â then the song of the is at its lowest ebb but as soon as the winter clouds have and the mountain are once more with snow the voices of the streams and increase in strength and richness until the flood season of early summer then the torrents chant their noblest and then is the flood time of our s melody as for weather dark days and sun days are the same to him the voices of most song birds however joyous suffer a long winter but the sings on through all the seasons and every kind of storm indeed no storm the water can be more violent than those of the in the midst of which he to dwell however dark and boisterous the weather blowing or cloudy all the same he sings and with never a note of sadness no need of spring sunshine to his for it never never shall you hear anything wintry from ms warm breast no pinched no wavering notes between sorrow and joy his mellow voice is ever to downright gladness as free from as cock it is pitiful to see frost pinched on cold mornings in the mountain groves shaking the snow from their feathers and about as if anxious to be cheery then hastening back to their out of the wind puffing out their breast feathers over their toes and among the leaves cold and while the snow continues to fall and there is no sign of clearing but the never calls forth a single touch of pity not because he is strong to endure but rather because he seems to live a charmed life beyond the reach of every influence that makes endurance necessary one wild winter morning when valley was swept its length from west to east by a cordial snow storm i forth to see what i might learn and enjoy a sort of gray like darkness filled the valley the huge walls were out of sight all ordinary sounds were smothered and even the of the falls was at times buried beneath the roar of the heavy laden blast the loose snow was already over five feet deep on the mountains of the meadows making extended walks impossible without the aid of snow shoes i found no great difficulty however in making my way to a certain ripple on the river where one of my lived he was at home busily his breakfast among the pebbles of a shallow portion of the margin apparently unaware of anything extraordinary in the weather presently he flew out to a stone against which the icy current was beating and turning his back to the wind sang as delightfully as a lark in after spending an hour or two with my favorite i made my way across the valley and through the to learn as definitely as possible how the other birds were spending their time the birds are easily found during the winter because all of them excepting the are to the sunny north side of the valley the south side being constantly by the great frosty shadow of the wall and because the indian groves from their peculiar exposure are the warmest the birds there more especially in severe weather i found most of the on the lee 
86,side of the larger branches where the snow could not fall upon them while two or three of the more were making desperate to reach the by clinging nervously to the under side of the snow crowned masses back downward like every now and then they would some of the loose of the snow crown which would come down on them and send them screaming back to camp the water where they would among their companions with a shiver muttering in low chatter like hungry children some of the were busy at the feet of the larger trees seeds and insects joined now and then by a robin weary of his unsuccessful attempts upon the snow covered the brave were clinging to the sides of the larger and branches of the camp trees making short flights from side to side of the grove now and then at the they had stored in the bark and chattering as if unable to keep still yet evidently putting in the time in a very dull way like storm bound at a country tavern the hardy nut were the open of the trunks in their usual industrious manner and uttering their quaint notes evidently less distressed than their neighbors the were of course making more noisy stir than all the other birds combined ever coming and going with loud screaming as if each had a lump of melting in his throat and taking good care to improve the favorable opportunity afforded by the storm to steal from the stores of the i also noticed one solitary gray eagle the storm on the top of a tall pine stump just outside the main grove he was standing bolt upright with his back to the wind a of snow piled on his square shoulders a monument of passive endurance thus every snow bound bird seemed more or less uncomfortable if not in positive distress the mountains of the was reflected in every gesture and not one cheerful note not to say song came from a single bill their endurance a striking contrast to the spontaneous irrepressible gladness of the who could no more help sweet song than a rose sweet fragrance he must sing though the heavens fall i remember noticing the distress of a pair of during the violent earthquake of the year when the pines of the valley with strange movements and waved their branches and rock brows came thundering down to the meadows in tremendous it did not occur to me in the midst of the excitement of other observations to look for the but i doubt not they were singing straight on through it all regarding the terrible rock thunder as as they do the of the what may be regarded as the separate songs of the are exceedingly difficult of description because they are so and at the same time so though i have been acquainted with my favorite ten years and during most of this time have heard him sing nearly every day i still detect notes and strains that seem new to me nearly all of his music is sweet and tender from his round breast like water over the smooth lip of a pool then breaking farther on into a sparkling foam of melodious notes which glow with subdued enthusiasm yet without expressing much of the strong ecstasy of the or the more striking strains are perfect of melody composed of a few full round mellow the notes embroidered with delicate which fade and melt in long slender in a general way his music is that of the streams refined and the deep notes of the falls are in it the of the of margin the low whispering of level reaches and the sweet of separate drops from the ends of and falling into tranquil pools the never sings in with other birds nor with his kind but only with the streams and like flowers that bloom beneath the surface of the ground some of our favorite s best song blossoms never rise above the surface of the heavier music of the water i have often observed him singing in the midst of beaten spray his music completely buried beneath the water s roar yet i knew he was surely singing by his gestures and the movements of his bill his food as far as i have noticed consists of all kinds of water insects which in summer are chiefly procured along shallow here he about his head under water and turning over pebbles and fallen leaves with his bill seldom choosing to go into deep water where he has to use his wings in he seems to be especially fond of the of found in abundance attached to the bottom of smooth rock channels where the current is shallow when feeding in such places he up stream and often while his head is under water the swift ent is upward along the glossy curves of his neck and shoulders in the form of a clear shell which fairly the mountains of him like a bell glass the shell being broken and re formed as he lifts and his head ever and anon he out to where the too powerful current carries him his feet then he rises on the wing and goes again in places but ing the winter when the stream banks are in snow and the streams themselves are chilled nearly to the point so that the snow falling into them in stormy weather is not wholly dissolved but forms a thin blue thus rendering the current â then he seeks the deeper portions of the main rivers where he may to clear water beneath the or he to some open lake or at the bottom of which he in safety when thus compelled to to a lake he does not plunge into it at once like a duck but always in the first place upon some rock or fallen pine along the shore then 
86,flying out thirty or forty yards more or less according to the character of the bottom he with a dainty on the surface about looks down finally makes up his mind and with a sharp stroke of his wings after feeding for two or three minutes he suddenly showers the water from his wings with one vigorous shake and rises abruptly into the air as if pushed up from beneath comes back to his perch sings a few minutes and goes out to again thus coming and going singing and at the same place for hours the is usually found singly rarely in the water s during the breeding season and very rarely in

his power of sub flight one stormy morning in winter when the river was blue and with snow i observed one of my perched on a out in the midst of a swift rushing rapid singing cheerily as if everything was just to his mind and while i stood on the bank admiring him he suddenly plunged into the current the water leaving his song abruptly broken off after feeding a minute or two at the bottom and when

whatever cause it never ed to me to look for their nests until more than a year after i had made the acquaintance of the birds themselves although i found one the very day on which i began the search in making my way from to the at the heads of the and rivers i in a particularly wild and romantic portion of the where in previous excursions i had never failed to enjoy the company of my who were attracted here no doubt by the safe places in the rocks and by the abundance of food and falling water the river for miles above and below consists of a succession of small falls from ten to sixty feet in height connected by flat like that go flashing from fall to fall free and almost over waving folds of polished granite on the south side of one of the falls that portion of the precipice which

here said i of all places is the most charming spot for an s nest then carefully the fretted face of the precipice through the spray i at length noticed a moss cushion growing on the edge of a level within five or six feet of the outer folds of the fall but apart from the fact of its being situated where one acquainted with the lives of would fancy an s nest ought to be there was nothing in its appearance visible at first sight to distinguish it from other of i moss situated with reference to spray and it was not until i had it again and again and had removed my shoes and stockings and crept along the face of the rock within eight or ten feet of it that i could decide certainly whether it was a nest or a natural growth in these moss huts three or four eggs are laid white like foam and well may the little birds from them sing water songs for they hear them all their lives and even before they are born i have often observed the young just out of the nest making their odd gestures and seeming in every way as much at home as their experienced parents like young bees on their first excursions to the flower fields no amount of familiarity with people and their ways seems to change them in the least to all appearance their behavior is just the the same on seeing a man for the st time as when they have seen him frequently on the i of the rivers where mills are they on through ot and all the noisy ot dogs i and work ou occasion while a â â â wood was at work on the river bank i observed one cheerily singing within reach of the flying nor does any kind of unwonted disturbance put him in bad humor or frighten him out of calm self possession in passing through a narrow the 
87,mountains of i once drove one ahead of me from rapid to rapid disturbing him four times in quick succession where he could not very well fly past me on account of the of the channel most birds under similar circumstances fancy themselves and become suspiciously uneasy but instead of growing nervous about it he made his usual and sang one of his most tranquil strains when observed within a few yards their eyes are seen to express remarkable gentleness and intelligence but they seldom allow so near a view one wears clothing of about the same color as the rocks and trees and knows how to sit on one occasion while rambling along the shore of a mountain lake where the birds at least those born that season had never seen a man i sat down to rest on a large stone close to the water s edge upon which it seemed the and were in the habit of when they came to feed on that part of the shore and some of the other birds also when they came down to wash or drink in a few minutes along came a and alighted on the stone beside me within reach of my hand then suddenly observing me he stooped nervously as if about to fly on the instant but as i remained as motionless as the stone he gained confidence and looked me steadily in the face for about a minute then flew quietly to the outlet and began to sing next came a and gazed at me with much the same expression of eye as the lastly down with a came a s out of a fir tree probably with the intention of his noisy the water throat but instead of sitting as my other visitors had done he rushed at once nearly tumbling heels over head into the lake in his suspicious confusion and with loud screams roused the neighborhood love for song birds with their sweet human voices appears to be more common and than love for flowers every one loves flowers to some extent at least in life s fresh morning attracted by them as instinctively as humming birds and bees even the young indians have sufficient love for the brightest of those found growing on the mountains to gather them and them as for the hair and i was glad to discover through the few indians that could be induced to talk on the subject that they have names for the wild rose and the lily and other conspicuous flowers whether available as food or otherwise most men however whether savage or civilized become toward all plants that have no other apparent use than the use of beauty but fortunately one s first instinctive love of is never wholly no matter what the influences upon our lives may be i have often been delighted to see a pure spiritual glow come into the countenances of hard business men and old when a song bird chanced to alight near them nevertheless the little of meat that out the breasts of some song birds is too often the cause of their death and

pines smoking his pipe and wearing the dull time away tom was his sole companion sharing his bed and sitting beside him on a stool with much the same drowsy expression of eye as his master the good natured bachelor was content with his hard fare of bread and bacon but tom the only creature in the world acknowledging dependence on him must needs be provided with fresh meat accordingly he himself to contrive traps and the snowy woods with his gun making sad among the few winter birds neither robin nor tiny and the pleasure of seeing tom eat and grow fat was his great reward one cold afternoon while hunting along the river bank he noticed a plain little bird about in the and immediately raised his gun but just then the confiding began to sing and after to his melody the charmed hunter turned away saying bless your little heart i can t shoot you not even for tom even so far north as icy i have found my glad singer when i was exploring the between mount and the river one cold day in november after trying snow at thb foot of the mountains of in vain to force a way through the innumerable of sum bay to the great at the head of it i was weary and baffled and sat resting in my

i thus lingered drifting with the in the midst of these gloomy and all the terrible desolation grandeur i suddenly heard the of an s wings and looking up saw my little coming straight across the ice from the shore in a second or two he was with me flying three times round my head with a happy salute as if saying cheer up old friend you see i m here and all s well then he flew back to the shore

a brave warm life and developing from generation to generation in perfect strength and beauty nearly all the lofty mountain chains of the globe are inhabited by wild sheep most of which on account of the remote and all but inaccessible regions where they dwell are imperfectly known as yet they are by different under from five to ten distinct species or varieties the best known being the of the the the large wild sheep of central and asia or the the of the mountains of northern africa and the rocky mountain the wild sheep to this last named species belongs the wild sheep of the its range according to the late professor of the institution extends from the region of the upper and to the mountains and the high gi adjacent to them on the eastern slope and as far south as the westward it extends to the coast of washington and and follows the some distance into throughout the vast region bounded on the east by the mountains and on the west by the there are more than a hundred subordinate and mountain groups north and south range beyond range with rising from eight to twelve thousand feet above the level of the sea probably all of which according to my own observations is or has been inhabited by this species compared with the which considering its size and the vast extent of its range is probably the most important of all the wild sheep our species is about the same size but the horns are less twisted and less the more important characteristics are however essentially the same some of the best maintaining that the two are only varied forms of one species in accordance with this view conjectures that since central asia seems to be the region where the sheep first appeared and from which it has been distributed the may have been distributed over this

mellow landscape glowed like a countenance in the deepest and sweetest repose on my way over the polished rocks along the river i came to an expanded portion of the about two miles long and a mile wide which formed a level park with picturesque granite walls like those of valley down through the middle of it the wild poured the beautiful river shining and in the golden light yellow groves on its banks and of brown meadow while the whole k was with wild life some of which even the head of the and least observing of must have seen had they been with me deer with their bounded from thicket to thicket as i advanced kept rising from the brown grass with a great of wings and on the mountains of the lower branches of the pines and allowed a near approach as if curious to see me farther on a broad shouldered showed himself coming out of a grove and crossing the river on a flood of logs halting for a moment to look back the bird like about my feet everywhere among the pine needles and gi ass ts the of the river the rattled from perch to perch and the blessed sang amid the spray of every where may lonely wanderer find a more interesting family of mountain earth born companions and fellow mortals it was afternoon when i joined them and the glorious landscape began to fade in the before i awoke from their enchantment then i sought a camp ground on the river bank made a of tea and lay down to sleep on a smooth place among the yellow leaves of an grove next day i discovered yet and life following the river over huge swelling rock through a majestic and past innumerable the scenery in general became gradually and more the sugar pine and silver gave place to the â and the walls became more rugged and bare and and became more abundant in the gardens and of meadow along the streams toward the middle of the afternoon i came to another valley strikingly wild and original in all its features and perhaps never before touched by human foot as regards area of level bottom land it is one of the wild sheep the very smallest of the type but its walls are sublime rising to a height of from to feet above the river at the head of the valley the main forks as is found to be the case in all the formation of this one is due chiefly to the action of two great fountains lay to the eastward on the of and and a cluster of nameless peaks farther south the mountains of the gray river was singing the valley but above its roar i heard the of a which drew me eagerly on and just as i emerged from the tangled groves and at the head of the valley the main fork of the river came in sight f fresh from its fountains in a snowy between granite walls feet high the steep incline down which the glad waters thundered seemed to bar all farther progress it was not long however before i discovered a crooked in the rock by which i was enabled to climb to the edge of a terrace that crosses the and the nearly in the middle here i sat down to take breath and make some in my note book taking advantage at the same time of my elevated position above the trees to gaze back over the valley into the heart of the noble landscape little knowing the while what neighbors were near after spending a few minutes in this way i chanced to look across the fall and there stood three sheep quietly observing me never did the sudden appearance of a mountain or fall or human friend more forcibly seize and my attention anxiety to observe accurately held me perfectly still eagerly i marked the flowing of their firm muscles their strong legs ears eyes heads their graceful rounded necks the color of their hair and the bold curves of their noble horns when they moved i watched every gesture while they in no wise disconcerted either by my attention or by the the wild sheep tumultuous roar of the water advanced deliberately alongside the between the two divisions of the turning now and then to look at me presently they came to a steep ice which they ascended by a succession of quick short stiff legged leaps reaching the top without a struggle this was the most startling feat of i had ever witnessed and considering only the of the thing my astonishment could hardly have been greater had they displayed wings and taken to flight sm on such gi would have fallen and rolled like loosened many a time where the slopes are far lower i have been compelled to take off my shoes and stockings tie them to my belt and creep with the utmost caution no wonder then that i watched the progress of these animal with keen sympathy and in the boundless of wild nature displayed in their invention construction and keeping a few minutes later i caught sight of a dozen more in one band near the foot of the upper fall they were standing on the same side of the river with me only twenty five or thirty yards away looking as and perfect as if created on the spot it appeared by their tracks which 
88,i had seen in the little and by their present position that when i came up the they were all feeding together down in the valley and in their haste to reach high ground where they could look about them to ascertain the nature of the strange disturbance they were divided three ascending on one side the river the rest on the other i ihe op the main band headed by an experienced chief now began to cross the wild between the two divisions of the this was another the wild sheep exciting feat for among all the varied experiences of the crossing of boisterous torrents is found to be one of the most trying to the nerves yet these fine fellows walked to the brink and jumped from to holding themselves in easy above the whirling current as if they were doing nothing extraordinary in the immediate of this rare picture there was a fold of ice granite traversed by a few bold lines in which rock and of were growing the gray walls on the sides nobly and adorned with brown and pines lofty peaks in the distance and in the middle ground the snowy fall the voice and soul of the landscape bushes beating time to its thunder tones the brave sheep in front of it their gray forms obscured in the spray yet standing out in good heavy relief against the close white water with their huge horns rising like the roots of dead pine trees while the evening streaming up the colored all the picture a rosy purple and made it glorious after crossing the river the led by their chief at once began to scale the wall turning now right now left in long single file keeping well apart out of one another s way and leaping in regular succession from to now ascending slippery dome curves now walking leisurely along the edges of stopping at times to gaze down at me from some flat rock with heads held as if curious to learn what i thought about it or whether i was likely to the â follow them after the top of wall which at this place is between and feet high they were still against the sky an they lingered looking down in groups of or throughout the entire ascent they did not make a single awkward step or an effort of any i have frequently seen tame sheep in mountains jump upon a sloping rock hold on a few seconds and fall back baffled and but in the most trying situations where the slightest want or would have l een fatal these always seemed to move in comfortable reliance on their strength and skill the limits of which they never appeared to know moreover each one of the flock while following the guidance of the most experienced yet climbed with intelligent independence as a perfect individual capable of separate existence whenever it should wish or be compelled to withdraw from the little the domestic sheep on the contrary is only a of an animal a whole flock being required to form an individual just as numerous are required to make one complete those who in summer drive their to the mountain pastures and while watching them night and day have seen them frightened y bears

was particularly interested in the question after witnessing the performances of this san band upon the rocks at the foot of the falls and as soon as i procured specimens and examined their feet all the mystery disappeared the secret considered in connection with strong muscles is simply this the wide portion of the bottom of the foot instead of wearing down and becoming flat and hard like the feet of tame sheep and horses out in a soft rubber like or cushion which not only i sl the of s holds well on smooth rocks but fits into and down upon or against slight tc w even the hardest portions

they could usually muster counting in children and all they were compelled therefore to build rows of hunters out of stones along the ridge tops which they wished to prevent the sheep from crossing

snowy laden mountains of the coast of the continent in washington british and probably more than dwell on the icy of mount and while i was exploring the of i saw flocks of these admirable nearly every day and often followed their through the of bewildering in which they are excellent guides three species of deer are found in â the black white and mule deer the first mentioned is by far the most abundant and occasionally meets the sheep during the summer on high meadows and along the edge of the timber line but being a forest animal seeking shelter and its young in dense it seldom visits the wild sheep in its higher homes the though not a is occasionally met in winter by the sheep while feeding along the edges of the sage plains and bare hills to the east of the so also is the mule deer which is almost in its range to this eastern region the white species belongs to 
88,the coast perhaps no wild animal in the world is without enemies but as a class have fewer than the slipping and crouching among long grass and bushes upon the and deer but seldom crosses the bald of the sheep neither can i the mountains of t he bears be regarded as enemies for though they seek to vary their every day diet of nuts and by an occasional meal of mutton they prefer to hunt tame and helpless flocks and no doubt capture an lamb at times or some unfortunate beset in deep soft snow but these cases are little more than accidents so also a few perish in long continued snow storms though in au my i have not found more than five or six that seemed to have met their fate in this way a httle band of three were discovered snow bound in bloody a few years ago and were killed with an ax by who chanced to be crossing the range in winter man is the most dangerous enemy of all but even from him our brave mountain has little to fear in the remote of the high the golden plains of the and san were lately thronged with bands of and but being fertile and accessible they were required for human pastures so also are many of the feeding grounds of the deer â hill valley forest and meadow â but it will be long before man will care to take the castles of the sheep and when we consider here how rapidly entire species of noble animals such as the and are being pushed to the very verge of all lovers of will rejoice with me in the rocky security of the of all the xv in the foot hills s camp is a curious old town in county at an elevation of feet above the sea situated like a nest in the of a rough region rich in gold iron veins of dead fire rivers and dead water rivers are developed here side by side within a of a few miles and placed open before the student like a book while the people and the region beyond the camp furnish mines of study of never failing interest and variety when i discovered this curious place i was tracing the channels of the ancient pr e rivers instructive sections of which have been laid bare here and in the adjacent regions by the according to the poets go on forever but those of the are young as yet and have scarcely learned the way down to the sea while at least one generation of them have died and vanished together with most of the they drained all that remains of them to tell their history is a series of interrupted fragments of

section that extends from the south side of the town beneath creek and the ridge beyond it to the of the but on account of its depth below the general surface of the present valleys the rich gold it is known to contain cannot be easily worked on a large scale their extraordinary richness may be inferred from the in the foot hills fact that many claims were worked in them by sinking shafts to a depth of feet or more and the dirt by a should the dip of this ancient channel be such as to make the available as a then the grand deposit might be worked by the method and although a long expensive would be required the scheme might still prove profitable for there is millions in it the importance of these ancient gi as gold fountains is well known to even the superficial of the present streams

strings of a harp with musical tones corresponding and on these stone we played by striking the crystal strings with a stick the delicious liquid tones they gave forth seemed perfectly divine as they sweetly whispered and wavered through the majestic and died away in faintest â the music of fairy land here we lingered and rejoicing to find so much music in stony silence so much splendor in

the foot hills however they seem to prefer homes and hiding places in and beneath as i have never seen their tracks in any of the this is the more remarkable because notwithstanding the darkness and water there is nothing cellar like or about them when we emerged into the bright of the sun everything looked brighter and we felt our faith in nature s beauty strengthened and saw more clearly that beauty is universal and immortal above beneath on land and sea mountain and plain in heat and cold light and darkness z chapter xvi the bee xv hen was wild it was one sweet â â iv garden throughout

golden beds of beds of beds of and and so on certain species blooming somewhere all the year round but of late years and sheep have made sad in these glorious pastures destroying of thousands of the acres like a fire and many species of the best honey plants to the bee pastures rocky cliffs and fence comers while on the other hand cultivation thus far has given no adequate compensation at least in kind only acres of for miles of the richest wild pasture ornamental roses and around cottage doors for of wild roses in the and small square and orange groves for broad of the great central plain of during the months of march april and may was one smooth continuous bed of honey bloom so rich that in walking from one end of it to the other a distance of more than miles your foot would press about a hundred flowers at every step and innumerable were so crowded together that had ninety nine per cent of them been taken away the plain would still have seemed to any but the radiant touching and and rising above one another glowed in the living light like a sunset sky â one sheet of purple and gold with the bright pouring through the midst of it from the north the san from the south and their many sweeping in at right angles from the mountains dividing the plain into sections fringed with trees along the rivers there is a strip of bottom land beneath the general level and wider toward the foot hills where magnificent oaks from three to eight feet in cast grateful masses of shade over the open like and close along the water s edge there was a fine the of ot tn composed of wild rose and bushes and a great variety of climbing vines and the branches and trunks of and and swinging across from summit to summit in heavy here the wild bees in fresh bloom long after the of the plain had withered and gone to i and in when the were ripe the indians came from the mountains to feast â men women and babies in long noisy trains often joined by the farmers of the who gathered this wild fruit with appreciation of its superior flavor while their home ds were full of ripe and and their were laden with gi but though these luxuriant shaggy river beds were thus distinct from the smooth plain they made no heavy dividing lines in general views the whole appeared as one continuous sheet of bloom bounded only by the mountains i first saw this central garden the most extensive and regular of all the bee pastures of the state it 
89,seemed all one sheet of plant gold and vanishing in the distance distinct as a new map along the foot hills at my feet descending the eastern slopes of the coast range through beds of and and around a and bush crowned i at length out into the midst of it all the ground was covered not with grass and green leaves but with radiant about ankle deep next the foot hills knee deep or more five or six the mountains of miles out here were etc growing in close social of various shades of yellow finely with the of and whose delicate were drinking the vital without giving back any sparkling glow because so long a period of extreme the rainy season most of the vegetation is composed of which spring up simultaneously and bloom together at about the same height above the ground the general surface being but slightly ruffled by the taller and groups of the king of the in any direction hundreds of these happy sun plants brushed against my feet at every step and closed over them as if i were in liquid gold the air was sweet with fragrance the sang their blessed songs rising on the wing as i advanced then sinking out of sight in the sod while of wild bees stirred the lower air with their monotonous hum â monotonous yet forever fresh and sweet as every day sunshine and showed themselves in considerable numbers in shallow places and small bands of were almost constantly in sight gazing curiously from some slight elevation and then bounding swiftly away with grace of motion yet i could discover no crushed flowers to mark their track nor indeed any destructive action of any wild foot or tooth whatever the great yellow days by while i drifted toward the north observing the the bee pa countless forms of life about me lying down almost anywhere on the approach of night and what glorious beds i had on i would find several new species leaning over me and looking me full in the face so that my studies would begin before rising about the first of may i turned eastward crossing the san between the mouths of the and and by the time i had reached the foot hills most of the vegetation had gone to seed and become as dry as hay all the seasons of the gi eat plain are warm or temperate and bee flowers are never wholly wanting but the grand â the annual â is governed by the rains which usually set in about the middle of november or the beginning of december then the seeds that for six months have lain on the ground dry and fresh as if they had been gathered into at once their life the general brown and purple of the ground and the dead vegetation of the preceding year give place to the green of and and of young leaves then one species after another comes into flower gradually the green with yellow and purple which lasts until may the rainy season is by no means a gloomy period of constant and rain perhaps nowhere else in north america perhaps in the world are the months of december january february and march so full of bland plant building sunshine to my notes of the winter and spring of every day of which i spent the mountains of out of doors on that section of the plain lying between the and rivers i find that the first rain of the season fell on december th january had only six rainy days â that is days on which rain fell february three march five april three and may three the so called rainy season which was about an average one the ordinary rain storm of this region is seldom very cold or violent the winds which in settled weather come from the round into the opposite direction the sky fills gradually and with one general cloud from which the rain falls steadily often for days in succession at a temperature of about or â more than seventy five per cent of all the rain of this season came from the down the coast over british washington and though the local winds of these circular storms blow from the one magnificent local storm from the fell on march a massive round cloud came swelling and thundering over the plain in most imposing majesty its front burning white and purple in the full blaze of the sun while warm rain poured from its ample like a beating down flowers and bees and the dry as suddenly as those of are by the so called but in less than an hour not a trace of the heavy mountain like cloud structure was left in the sky and the bees were on the wing as if nothing more gratefully refreshing could have been sent them the bee by the end of january four species of plants were in flower and five or six had already adjusted their and were in the prime of life but the flowers were not sufficiently numerous as yet to greatly the general green of the young leaves made their appearance in the first week of february and toward the end of this month the warmer portions of the plain were already golden with of the flowers of this was the full the sunshine grew warmer and richer new plants every day the air became more with humming wings and sweeter with the fragrance of the opening flowers and ground were getting ready for their summer work rubbing their limbs and themselves on the piles before their doors and were busy mending their old or weaving new ones in march the vegetation was more than doubled in depth and color a large white and two were in bloom together with a host of yellow tall enough now to bend in the wind and show wavering of shade 
89,in april plant life as a whole reached its greatest height and the plain over all its varied surface was with a close of purple and golden by the end of this month most of the species had their seeds but still seemed to be in bloom from the numerous like and of scales of the in may the bees of i i i only a few deep set plants c i â j ir july august and september is the season of r sleep â a winter of dry heat â followed in i v r by a second outburst of bloom at the tâ y time of the year then after the mass of leaves and of the dead n and turn to dust beneath the as if it had been baked in an oven a slender little plant from six he to feet high suddenly makes its in patches miles in extent like a of the bloom of april i have counted upward rf flowers five of an inch in ou a single plant both its leaves and stems are so as to be nearly invisible at a distance of a few amid so a multitude of flowers the ray and flowers are both yellow the purple and the texture of the rays is rich and like the of garden the wind turns all the heads iv to the so that in facing we have the flowers looking us in the face in my estimation this little plant the last bom of the brilliant host of that the plain is the most interesting of all it remains in flower november with two or three species of why which continue the chain around december to the spring flowers of january thus although the main bloom and honey season is only about three months long the circle however thin around some of the hot months is never completely broken the bee how long the various species of wild bees have lived in this honey garden nobody knows probably ever since the main body of the present gained possession of the land toward the close of the period the first brown honey bees brought to are said to have arrived in san in march a bee keeper by the name of purchased a lot consisting of twelve from some one at who had brought them from new york when landed at san all the contained live bees but they finally to one hive which was taken to san the little flourished and multiplied in the pastures of the valley sending off three the first season the owner was killed shortly afterward and in settling up his estate two of the were sold at for and other were made from time to time by way of the and though great pains were taken to success about one half usually died on the way four were brought safely across the plains in the being placed in the rear end of a wagon which was stopped in the afternoon to allow the bees to fly and feed in the places that were within reach until dark when the were closed in two years after the time of the first from new york a single swarm was brought over from san and let fly in the great central plain bee culture however has never gained much attention here notwithstanding the the of v â â â â iu of honey bloom and the high c jl daring the early years a few ar and there among who râ fc â to have learned something about the r o r t â to the state but sheep cattle z raising are the chief as t skill and care while the profits c e n greater in honey sold here ad ci and a half to two dollars per pound tv n t the price had fallen to twelve fc eâ in i sat down to dinner wi i i sheep at a â ie sail where fifteen or twenty w h b w oar st advised us not to spare the of honey he had placed on the table as w tbe article he had to in all ny w hâ i have never come upon a r se oh in the central valley like those so and so managed in the southern i v i of the state the few pounds of honey arid wax are consumed at home and are y taken into account among the of the farm the that escape from their careless owners have a weary time of it in seeking suitable homes most of them make their to the foot hills of the mountains or to the trees that hue the banks of the rivers where some hollow log or trunk may be found a friend of mine while out hunting on the san came upon an old trap hidden among some tall grass near the edge of the river upon which he sat down to rest shortly afterward his attention was attracted to a crowd the bee pastures of angry bees that were flying excitedly about his head when he discovered that he was sitting upon their hive which was found to contain more than pounds of honey out in the broad of the and san rivers the little have been known to build their in a bunch of rushes or stiff grass only slightly protected from the weather and in danger every spring of being carried away by floods they have the advantage however of a vast extent of fresh pasture accessible only to themselves the present condition of the grand central garden is very different from that we have about twenty years ago when the gold had been pretty thoroughly exhausted the attention of fortune â not home â was in gi eat part turned away from the mines to the fertile plains and many began experiments in a kind of restless wild e a load 
90,of lumber would be hauled to some spot on the free wilderness where water could be easily found and a rude box cabin built then a gang was procured and a dozen worth ten or fifteen dollars apiece and with these hundreds of acres were stirred as easily as if the land had been under cultivation for years tough roots being almost wholly absent thus a was established and from these bare wooden huts as of desolation the wild vanished in ever circles but the arch are the with their flocks of sweeping over the ground like a fire and down every rod that escapes the the mountains of as completely as if the whole plain were a cottage garden plot without a fence but notwithstanding these a thousand of bees may be here for every one now gathering honey the greater portion is still covered every season with a repressed growth of bee flowers for most of the species are and many of them are not by sheep or cattle while the rapidity of their growth them to develop and mature their seeds before any foot has time to crush them the ground is therefore kept sweet and the race is though only as a shadow of the magnificence of its the time will undoubtedly come when the entire area of this noble valley will be like a garden when the waters of the mountains now flowing to the sea will be distributed to every acre giving rise to prosperous towns wealth arts etc then i suppose there will be few left even among to the vanished in the mean time the pure waste going on â the wanton destruction of the â is a sad sight to see and the sun may weu be pitied in being compelled to look on the bee pastures of the coast last longer and are more varied than those of the great plain on account of differences of soil and climate moisture and shade etc some of the mountains are upward of feet in height and small streams springs etc occur in great abundance and variety in the wooded regions while open with sunshine and valleys lying at different each with the bee pastures its own peculiar climate and exposure possess the required conditions for the development of species and families of plants widely varied next the plain there is first a series of smooth hills planted with a rich and vegetation that but little from that of the plain itself â as if the edge of the plain had been lifted and bent into flowing folds with all its flowers in place only toned down a little as to their and a few new species introduced such as the hill and the colors show finely when thus held to view on the slopes patches of red purple blue yellow and white around the edges the whole appearing at a little distance like a map colored in sections above this lies the park and region with oaks mostly planted wide apart and blooming shrubs from three to ten feet high and of several species mixed with cherry and in shaggy and many species of etc in the the main send out spurs somewhat parallel to their level valleys many of them quite extensive and containing a great profusion of sun loving bee flowers in their wild state but these are in great part already lost to the bees by cultivation nearer the coast are the giant forests of the extending from near the line to beneath the cool deep shade of these majestic trees the ground is occupied by the mountains of chiefly and with only a few plants â and other shade lovers but all along the belt there are sunny on hill slopes looking to the south where the giant trees stand back and give the ground to the small and the bees around the lofty walls of these little bee acres there is usually a fringe of chestnut oak laurel and the last of which is a beautiful tree and a great favorite with the bees the trunks of the largest specimens are seven or eight feet thick and about fifty feet high the bark red and colored the leaves plain large and glossy like those of while the flowers are white and urn shaped in weu from five to ten inches long when in full bloom a single tree seems to be visited at times by a whole hive of bees at once and the deep hum of such a multitude makes the listener guess that more than the ordinary work of honey winning must be going on how perfectly and care are these withdrawn gardens of the woods â long opening to the sea â sunshine and pouring upon the gi in a tremulous shifting as the light ways in the leafy wall open and close with the swaying breeze â shining leaves and flowers birds and bees mingling together in harmony and soothing fragrance from a thousand thousand fountains in these days when the deep heart beats of nature are felt thrilling rocks the bee pa and trees and everything alike common business and friends are happily forgotten and even the natural honey work of bees and the care of birds for their young and mothers for their children seem slightly out of place to the northward in and the adjacent whole are covered with making a glorious melody of bee bloom in the spring and the western hardly less grows in three to eight feet high around the edges of groves and woods as far south as san usually accompanied by while the valleys with their varying moisture and shade yield a rich variety of the smaller honey flowers such as and other with wild and and in the cool along the stream banks where the shade of trees is not too deep dog wood and and many species of form some portion of which 
90,continues in bloom for months though the coast region was the first to be invaded and settled by white men it has suffered less from a bee point of view than either of the other main divisions chiefly no doubt because of the of the surface and because it is owned and protected instead of lying exposed to the flocks of the wandering these remarks apply more particularly to the north half of the coast farther south there is less moisture less forest shade and the honey is less varied the mountains of the region is the largest of the three main divisions of the bee lands of the state and the most regularly varied in its owing to their gradual rise from the level of the central plain to the the foot hill region is about as dry and from the end of may the setting in of the winter rains as the plain there are no shady forests no damp at all like those lying at the same in the coast mountains the social of the plain with a few added species form the bulk of the portion of the vegetation up to a height of feet or more shaded lightly here and there with oaks and pines and interrupted by patches of and above this and just below the forest region there is a dark heath like belt of composed almost exclusively of a bush belonging to the rose family from five to eight feet high with small round leaves in and bearing a multitude of small white flowers in on the ends of the upper branches where it occurs at all it usually covers all the ground with a close impenetrable growth scarcely broken for miles up through the forest region to a height of about feet above sea level there are ragged patches of and five or six species of called deer brush or these are the most important of all the honey bearing bushes of the a little about a foot high with flowers like the makes handsome carpets beneath the pines and seems to be a favorite with the bees while the bee pastures pines themselves furnish unlimited quantities of and honey dew the product of a single tree its at the right time of year would be sufficient for the wants of a whole hive along the streams there is a rich growth of lilies and the region contains the meadows and countless small gardens in all sorts of places full of of several species and with beds of and the charming covered with sweet bells even the tops of the mountains are blessed with flowers â dwarf etc i have seen wild bees and feeding at a height of feet above the sea many however that go up these dangerous heights never come down again some undoubtedly perish in storms and i have found thousands lying dead or on the surface of the to which they had perhaps been attracted by the white glare taking them for beds of bloom from that escaped their owners in the the honey bee is now generally distributed throughout the whole length of

pounds of honey the destructive action of sheep has not been so general on the mountain pastures as on those of the great plain but in many places it has been the mountains of more complete owing to the more character of the soil and its sloping position the digging and down action of hoofs on the slopes of has and buried many of the tender plants from year to year without allowing them time to

and contain thousands of lovely bee gardens lying hid in side and recesses with and on the top of flat projecting where only bees would think to look for them but on the other hand a great portion of the plants that escape the feet and teeth of the sheep are destroyed by the by means of running fires which are set everywhere during the dry autumn for the purpose of burning the old fallen trunks and with a view to improving the pastures and more open ways for the flocks these destructive sheep fires sweep through nearly the entire forest belt of the range from one extremity to the other not

its many and sweeping aloft from the plain into the frosty we find the first feet from the summit generally snow clad and therefore about as as the sea the base of this region is by a belt of crumbling measuring about feet in breadth and is mostly free from snow in summer beautiful the faces of the cliffs with their bright colors and in some of the warmer there are a few of wall flowers and but notwithstanding the mountains of these bloom freely in the late summer the as a whole is almost as as the icy summit and its lower edge may be taken as the honey line immediately below this comes the forest covered with a rich growth of chiefly silver rich in and honey dew and with countless garden many of them less than a hundred yards across next in orderly succession comes the great bee its area far that of the icy summit and both the other combined for it goes sweeping around the entire mountain with a breadth of six or seven miles and a of nearly a hundred miles as we have already seen is a fire mountain created by a succession of of ashes and which over the lips of its several grew outward and upward like the trunk of a tree then followed a strange contrast the winter came on the mountain with ice which flowed slowly outward in every direction from the summit in the form of one vast â a down crawling mantle of ice upon a fountain of fire crushing and grinding for centuries its brown with incessant activity and thus degrading and the entire mountain when at length the period began to draw near its close the ice mantle was gradually melted off around the bottom and in receding and breaking into its present condition irregular rings and heaps of matter were stored upon its the the bee pastures of most of the produces composed of rough sub of moderate size and of gi and sand which freely to the power of running water magnificent floods from the ample fountains of ice and snow working with sublime energy upon this prepared it out and carried down immense quantities from the higher slopes and it in smooth like beds around the base and it is these flood beds joined together that now form the main honey of the old thus by forces seemingly and destructive has mother nature accomplished her designs â now a flood of fire now a flood of ice now a flood of water and at length an outburst of life a way of snowy and wings the rugged mountain like a cloud as if the beating against its sides had broken into a foam of plant bloom and bees as sea waves break and bloom on a rock shore in this wilderness the bees and rejoicing in the of the sun eagerly through and ringing the bells of the now humming aloft among and now down on the ground among and and anon plunging deep into snowy banks of cherry and they consider the lilies and roll into them and like lilies they toil not for they are impelled by sun power as water wheels by and when the one has plenty of high the mountains of sure water the other plenty of sunshine they hum and quiver alike in the bee lands in the sun days of summer one may readily infer the time of day from the comparative energy of bee movements alone â drowsy and moderate in the cool of the morning increasing in energy with the ascending sun and at high noon thrilling and quivering in wild ecstasy then gradually declining again to the stillness of night in my excursions among the i occasionally meet bees that are hungry like who venture too far and remain too long above the bread line then they and like autumn leaves the bees are perhaps better fed than any others in the their field work is one perpetual feast but however the sunshine or the supply of flowers they are always dainty humming and seldom set foot upon a flower but on the wing in front of it and reach forward as if they were through but bees though as dainty as they their favorite flowers with profound cordiality and push their blunt faces against them like babies on their mother s bosom and fondly too with eternal 
90,love does mother nature clasp her bee babies and them multitudes at once on her warm breast besides the common honey bee there are many other species here â fine fellows who were nourished on the mountains thousands of sunny seasons before the advent of the domestic species among these are the the bee pastures bees carpenter bees and leaf too and of every size and pattern some broad winged like flapping slowly and sailing in easy curves others like small flying shaking about loosely in short crooked flights close to the flowers night and day great numbers of deer also delight to dwell in the portions of the bee pastures bears too the sweet wilderness their blunt shaggy forms well with the trees and tangled bushes and with the bees also standing the in size they are fond of all good things and enjoy them to the utmost with but little troublesome â flowers and leaves as well as and the bees themselves as well as their honey though the bears have as yet had but little experience with they often succeed in reaching their stores and it seems doubtful whether bees themselves enjoy honey with so great a relish by means of their powerful teeth and claws they can and tear open almost any hive conveniently accessible most honey bees however in search of a home are wise enough to make choice of a hollow in a living tree a considerable distance above the ground when such places are to be had then they are pretty secure for though the smaller black and brown bears climb well they are unable to break into strong while compelled to exert themselves to keep from falling and at the same time to endure the of the fighting bees without having their free to rub them off but woe to the black discovered in their the mountains of nests in the ground with a few strokes of

superior sweetness of the are its storms â storms i mean that are strictly local bred and born on the mountain the rapidity with which they are grown on the mountain top and bestow their charity in rain and snow never fails to astonish the inexperienced often in calm glowing days while the bees are still on the wing a storm cloud may be seen far above in the pure swelling its pearl and growing silently like a plant presently a clear ringing discharge of thunder is heard followed by a rush of wind that comes sounding over the bending woods like the roar of the ocean mingling snow flowers honey flowers and bees in wild storm harmony still more impressive are the warm days of spring in the mountain pastures the blood of the plants throbbing beneath the life giving sunshine seems to be

bees here and there by orange groves fields and small home gardens the main honey months in ordinary seasons are april may june july and august while the other months are usually enough to yield sufficient for the bees according to mr j t president of the los county bee association the first bees introduced into the county were a single hive which cost in san and arrived in september in april

91,wood he seemed surprised at seeing me so i sat down with him on the live oak log he had been cutting and made the mountains of to give a reason for my appearance in his si explaining that i was anxious to find out si about the mountains and meant to make my way up creek next morning then he invited me to camp with him and led me to his little cabin situated at the foot of the mountains where a small spring out of a bank wn with wild rose bushes after supper when the daylight was gone he explained that he was out of candles so we sat in the dark while he gave me a sketch of his life in a mixture of spanish and english he was bom in his father irish his mother spanish he had been a hunter etc rambling always and wearing his life away in mere waste but now he was going to settle down his past life he said was of no account but the future was promising he was going to make money and marry a spanish woman people mine here for water as for gold he had been running a into a spur of the back of his cabin my prospect is good he said and if i chance to strike a good strong flow i soon be worth or for that flat out there referring to a small irregular patch of two or three acres in size that had been deposited by creek during some flood season â that flat is large enough for a nice and the bank behind the cabin will do for a a and after watering my own trees and i will have some water left to sell to my neighbors below me down the valley and then he continued i can keep bees and make money the mountains of that way too for the mountains above here are just full of honey in the summer time and one of my neighbors down here says that he will let me have a whole lot of on shares to start with you see i ve a good thing i m all right now all this in the sunken choked flood bed of a mountain stream leaving the bees out of the count most would as soon think of settling on the summit of mount next morning wishing my hopeful good luck i set out on my shaggy excursion about half an hour s walk above the cabin i came to the fall famous throughout the valley as the finest yet discovered in the san mountains it is a charming little thing with a low sweet voice singing like a bird as it from a in a short ledge some or forty feet into a round mirror pool the face of the cliff back of it and on both sides is smoothly covered and with against which the white water shines out in relief like a silver instrument in a velvet case hither come the san lads and to gather and away their hot holidays in the cool water glad to escape from their commonplace palm gardens and

the middle of the basin forcing a way over its many subordinate and across its eastern rim having to contend almost with the and most impenetrable growth of honey bushes i had ever encountered since first my began most of the is leafy nearly to the ground here the main stems are naked for three or four feet and with dead twigs forming a stiff through which even the bears make their way with difficulty i was compelled to creep for miles on all and in following the bear often found of hair on the bushes where they had forced themselves through for feet or so above the fall the ascent was made possible only by tough cushions of club moss that clung to the rock above this the ridge away to a thin knife blade for a few hundred yards and thence to the summit of the range it carries a mane

the preliminary and some adventurer occasionally looks down the throat of the admiring the and wondering whether is as beautiful but when with awful uproar as if were falling and storms thundering in the depths the outburst begins all run away to a safe distance and look on awe stricken and silent in devout wonder the largest and one of the most wonderfully beautiful of the springs is ae which the guide will be sure to show you with a of yards it is more like a lake than a spring the water is pure deep blue in the centre to green on the edges and its basin and the slightly pavement about it are bright and varied in color this one of the multitude of fountains is of itself object enough for a trip across the continent no wonder that so many fine have originated in springs that so many fountains were held sacred in the youth of the the national park world and had miraculous virtues ascribed to them even in these cold doubting questioning scientific times many of the fountains seem able to work miracles near the spring is the great which is said to throw a column of boiling water to feet in to a height of om to feet at periods this is the greatest of all the yet discovered anywhere the which sweeps past it is at stages a stream about yards wide and feet deep but when the is in so great is the quantity of water charged that the volume of the river is doubled and it is rendered too hot and rapid to be are found in many other regions â in new the the eastern america the and elsewhere but only in new and this rocky mountain park do they display their forms and of these three famous regions the is easily first both in the number and in the size of its the greatest height of the column of the great of actually measured was feet and of the feet in new the te at lake the at and two others are said to lift their waters occasionally to a height of feet while the celebrated te at i national lifts a boiling feet in to a height of feet but all these are far surpassed by the few however wiu see the in action or a thousand other interesting features of the park that lie beyond the wagon roads and the hotels the regular â from three to five days â are too short nothing can be done well at a speed of forty a day the multitude of mixed novel impressions rapidly piled on one another make only a dreamy bewildering most of which is far more time should be taken walk away quietly in any direction and taste the freedom of the camp out among the grass and of meadows in garden full of nature s climb the mountains and get their good tidings t s peace will flow into you as sunshine flows into trees the winds will blow their own freshness into you and the storms their energy while cares will drop off like autumn leaves as age comes on one source of enjoyment after another is closed but nature s sources never fail like a generous host she offers here cups in endless variety served in a grand hall the sky its ceiling the mountains its walls decorated with g ana e band rf lo ever j ing the petty that beset the awkward guest the are quickly x the national park forgotten while all that is precious remains fears vanish as soon as one is fairly free in the most of the dangers that haunt the citizen are imaginary the real ones are perhaps too â e too j for j the hears that always seem to spring up thick as trees in fighting devouring attitudes before the frightened whenever a trip is proposed are gentle now finding they are no longer likely to be shot and the other big dread of over civilized people are scarce here for most of the park lies above the snake line poor creatures loved only by their maker they are timid and as know and though perhaps not possessed of much of that charity that suffers long and is kind seldom either by mistake or by do harm to any one certainly they cause not the part of the pain and death that follow the footsteps of the admired rocky mountain nevertheless again and again in season and out of season the question comes up what are good for as if nothing that does not obviously make for the benefit of man had any right to exist as if our ways were god s ways long ago an indian to whom a french put this old question replied that their tails were good for and their heads for fever our national anyhow they are all head and tail good for themselves and we need not them their share of life fear nothing no town park you have been as the it is a hard place to leave even its names in your are attractive and should draw you far from wagon roads â all save the early ones derived from the infernal regions hell roaring river hell springs the devil s etc indeed the whole region was at first called s hell from the fiery stories told by who left the and expedition and wandered through the park in the year with a band 
94,of indians the later names many of which we owe to mr of the u s survey are so telling and that they set our dancing and make us begin to enjoy the of excursions ere they are commenced three river peak two ocean pass continental divide are capital descriptions thousands of miles of rejoicing streams and all that belongs to them big horn pass peak big game ridge bring brave mountain animals to mind hills hills mountain storm peak electric peak roaring mountain are bright names and swan lakes the national park np fine pictures and so also do and creek and and are lively and sparkling names that help the streams to shine and and what pictures these bring up violet morning mist and springs and many beside give us visions of fountains more beautifully arrayed than solomon in all his purple and golden glory all these and a host of others call you to camp you may be a little cold some nights on mountain tops above the timber line but you will see the stars and by and by you can sleep enough in your town bed or at least in your grave keep awake while you may in mountain so rare if you are not very strong try to climb electric peak when a big well charged thunder cloud is on it to breathe the set free and get yourself kindly shaken and shocked you are sure to be lost in wonder and praise and every hair of your head will stand up and after this experience you should take a look into a few of the volumes of the grand of the park and see how rod writes history no knowledge is required only a calm day and a calm mind perhaps nowhere else in the mountains have national the forces been so busy more than ten thousand square miles have been covered to a depth of at least five thousand feet with material from and during the period forming broad sheets of etc and masses of ashes sand and stones now into charged with the remains of plants and animals that lived in the calm genial periods that separated the perhaps the most interesting and telling of these rocks to the hasty are those that make up the mass of mountain on its north side it presents a section two thousand feet high of roughly beds of sand ashes and coarse and fine forming the edges of a wonderful set of volumes lying on their sides â books a million years old weu bound in size with full page on the of this one section we see trunks and of fifteen or ancient forests ranged one above another standing where they grew or prostrate and broken like the of ruined temples in desert sands â a forest fifteen or twenty stories high the roots of each spread above the tops of the next beneath it telling wonderful tales of the centuries with their and growth and death fire ice and flood the national park there were giants in those days the largest of the standing and and prostrate sections of the trunks are from two or three to fifty feet in height or and from five to ten feet in and so perfect is the that the annual rings and are clearer and more easily counted than those of trees centuries of burial having brightened the records instead of them they show that the of the period gave as decided a check to vegetable growth as do those of the present time some trees grew rapidly increasing twenty inches in in as many years while others of the same species on poorer soil or increased only two or three inches in the same time among the roots and on the old forest floors we find the remains of and bushes and the seeds and leaves of trees like those now growing on the southern â such as laurel ash studying the lowest of these forests the soil it grew on and the it is buried in we see that it was rich in species and flourished in a genial sunny climate when its stately trees were in their glory fires broke forth from and like larger ashes stones and mud which fell on the doomed forest like hail and national snow through the and branches choking the streams covering the ground and rapidly deepening packing around the trees and breaking the r her ike of the buried leaving n ot a leaf of in sight so complete was the desolation at last the storm began to the soil settled mud floods and floods passed over it it it rains fell and mellow sunshine and it became fertile and ready for another crop birds and the winds and brought seeds from more fortunate woods and a new forest grew up on the top of the buried one centuries of genial growing seasons passed the trees became giants and with strong branches spread a leafy over the gray land the sleeping fires again awake and shake the mountains and every leaf the old with perhaps new ones are opened and immense quantities of ashes and are again thrown into the sky the sun of his beams like a dull red ball until hidden in clouds snow hail and floods fall on the new forest burying it alive like the one beneath its roots then come another noisy band of mud floods and floods mixing settling the new ground more seeds sun the national park shine and showers and a third noble forest is carefully raised on the top of the second and so on forest was planted above forest and destroyed as if nature were ever the work she had so done and burying it of course this destruction was creation pro v in the march of beauty through death how quickly these old monuments excite and hold the imagination i we see the old 
94,stone and and waving in the wind as magnificent trees standing shoulder to shoulder branches in grand varied round headed forests see the sunshine of morning and evening their trunks and at high noon on the thick glossy leaves of the through of and ash and falling in mellow patches on the floor see the shining after rain breathe the fragrance and hear the winds and birds and the murmur of and insects we watch them from season to season see the swelling when the sap begins to flow in the spring the opening leaves and blossoms the of summer fruits the colors of autumn and the of branches and in winter and we see the sudden of the storms that overwhelmed them one calm morning at sunrise i saw the oaks our national and pines in valley shaken by an their tops back and forth and every branch and needle shuddering as if in like the frightened screaming birds one may imagine the rocking of those ancient woods and the terror of their inhabitants hen fir t were felt the sky grew dark and rock laden floods began to roar but though they were close pressed and buried cut off from sun and wind all their happy leaf fluttering and waving done other currents through them and thrilling every fibre and beautiful wood was replaced by beautiful stone now their rocky are partly open and show forth the natural beauty of death after the forest times and fire times had passed away and the were and held in another great change occurred the winter came on the sky was again darkened not with dust and ashes but with snow which fell in glorious abundance deeper deeper slipping from the heights in into that flowed over all the landscape wiping off forests grinding the comparatively beds into the beautiful of hill and and of mountains we behold to day forming for lakes channels for streams the national park new for forests gardens and meadows while this ice work was going on the fires were boiling the waters and with curious the rocks making beauty in the darkness these forces seemingly working together how wild their meetings on the surface were we may imagine when the period began and hot springs were playing in volume it may be those of to day the flowed over them while they and thundered carrying away their fine and and their mysterious channels the made l ti e down required to bring the present features of the landscape into relief are possibly no better than were some of the old that were carried away and which as we have seen nourished magnificent forests but the are more beautiful than the old ones were the winter has passed away like the ancient and fire periods though in the of the all these times are recent only small on the cool northern slopes of the highest mountains are left of the vast all embracing ice mantle as and are all that are left of the ancient now the post agents are at work on the national grand old of the park region ii ing new characters but still in its main telling features it remains distinctly the are being refined re formed and covered with vegetation the and and other superficial on the crumbling are being rapidly are being cut in the and loose and and seem to be springing up like growing trees while the are miles of and nevertheless the ice work is scarce as yet these later effects are only spots and wrinkles on the grand countenance of the park perhaps you have already said that you have seen enough for a lifetime but before you go away you should spend at least one day and a night on a mountain top for a last general settling view mount is a good one for the purpose because it stands in the middle of the park is with other peaks and is so easy of access that the climb to its summit is a first your goes â g m d l rim ld the hundreds of peaks some with plain flowing skirts others abruptly and defended by sheer flat or round heaving like sea waves or and the national park like with snow in the and darkened with of adventurous trees climbing the the nearer peaks are perchance clad in blue others far off in white in the broad glare of noon they seem to shrink and to less than half their real stature and grow dull and mere dead heaps of waste ashes and stone giving no hint of the multitude of animals enjoying life in their or of the bright streams and lakes but when storms blow they awake and arise wearing robes of and mist in majestic speaking like gods in the color glory of morning and evening they become still more impressive in the divine light of the their and with the heavens they seem neither high nor low over all the central which from here seems level and over the and lower slopes of the mountains the forest extends like a black uniform bed of weeds interrupted only by lakes and meadows and small burned spots called â all of them except the lake being mere and in general views made conspicuous by their color and brightness about eighty five per cent of the entire area of the park is covered with trees the lodge pole pine national with a few and of silver fir and a few and the is found only on the lowest portions the silver fir on the highest and the on the places best defended from fire some fine specimens of the pine are growing on the of â wide sturdy trees as broad as high with trunks five feet in leafy and shady laden with purple and rose colored flowers the and sub silver fir are beautiful and notable trees â tall hardy 
95,frost and snow and widely distributed over the west wherever there is a mountain to climb or a cold slope to cover but neither of these is a good with rather thin bark and scattering their seeds every year as soon as they are ripe they are quickly driven out of fire swept regions when the were melting these hardy trees were probably among the first to arrive on the new beds but as the became and fires an to ft â p n â â  into the wet spots and islands where we now find them leaving nearly all the park to the pine which though as thin as they and as easily killed by fire takes pains to store the national park up its seeds in firmly closed and holds them from three to nine years so that let the fire come when it may it is ready to die and ready to live again in a new generation for when the killing fires have devoured the leaves and thin bark many of the only open as soon as the smoke away the store of seeds is sown on the cleared and a new growth immediately spring up out of tiie therefore this tree not only holds its ground but extends its farther after every fire thus the and of its growth e accounted for in one part of the forest that i examined the growth was about as close as a cane the trees were from four to eight inches in one hundred feet high and one hundred and seventy five years old the lower limbs die young and drop off for want of light life with these close planted trees is a race for light more light and so they push straight for the sky off ten feet from the top of the forest would make it look like a crowded mass of poles for only the sunny tops are leafy a ten years old growing in the sunshine has as many leaves as a crowded tree one or two hundred years old as fires are multiplied and the mountains become this wonderful pine bids fair to obtain possession of nearly all the forest ground in the west national how still the woods seem from here jet how lively a stir the hidden animals are making digging biting eyes shining at work and play getting food young through the climbing the rocks solitary tracing the banks of the lakes and streams insect are dancing in the in the ground swimming â a cloud of witnesses telling nature s joy the plants are as busy as the animals every ii in of hive singing the old new song of creation a and puff of are seen above the some near but most of them far off indicating and hot springs and

lawless the and of storms the of waves the of sap in plants each and all tell the orderly love beats of nature s heart to the eastward you have the grand and reaches of the river in full view and yonder to the southward lies the great lake the largest and most important of all the high fountains of the and the last to be discovered the national park in the year when de with a romantic band of was seeking gold and glory and the fountain of youth he found the a few hundred miles above its mouth and made his grave beneath its floods la in after discovering the one of the largest and most beautiful branches of the traced the latter to the sea from the mouth of the through adventures and not easily realized now about the same time and father reached the father of waters by way of the but more than a century passed ere its highest sources in these mountains were seen the advancing stream of civilization has ever followed its guidance toward the west but none of the thousand tribes of indians living on its banks could tell the whence it came from those romantic de and la days to these times of and how much has the great river seen and done i great as it now is and still growing longer through the ground of its and the of receding at its head it was immensely broader toward the close of the period when the ice mantle of the mountains was melting then with its three hundred thousand miles of branches over the plains and valleys of the continent laden with fertile mud it made the biggest and most generous bed of soil in the world national think of this stream springing in be first place in from the sea flying on the wind on the mountains in hail and snow and rain lingering in many a fountain feeding the and l then scattered waters gliding from its noble lake and going back home to the ringing au the way on it sweeps through the gates of the mountains across the vast and plains through many a wild gloomy forest cane and sunny from and and pine woods to warm groves

huge folds serene majestic overflowing all its and bounds the upon its banks building wasting planting old islands and making new ones taking away fields and towns as if sport carrying and ships of commerce in the midst of its spoils and drift the continent as one vast farm then its work done it gladly in its ocean home welcomed by the waiting thus naturally standing here in the midst of its fountains we 
95,trace ihe fortunes of the great river and how much more comes to mind as the national park we overlook this wonderful wilderness i fountains of the and lie before with those of the and and fine it would be to go with them to the pacific but the sun is already in the west and soon our day will be done yonder is mountain and other mountains hardly less rich in old forests which now seem to spring up again in their glory and you see the storms that buried them â the ashes and torrents laden with and mud the centuries of sunshine and the dark lurid nights you see again the vast floods of red hot and white out from the of lakes and streams absorbing or driving away their hissing screaming waters flowing around hills and every subordinate feature then you see the snow and taking possession of the land making new how admirable it is that after passing through so many of frost and fire and flood the and even the complexion of the landscape should still be so fine i thus the past we see nature working with enthusiasm like a man blowing her a blacksmith blowing his fires over the our national and like a farmer and gardener doing rough work and fine work planting and pines and working in gems filling every crack and hollow with them fine painting plants and shells clouds mountains all the earth and heavens like an artist â ever working toward higher and higher where may the mind

its beauty displayed in and forms w â e wanderer on and on higher and higher charmed and enchanted benevolent solemn pervaded with divine every landscape like a countenance in eternal repose and every

seems to get more light than other mountains the weather is mostly sunshine with magnificent storms and nearly everything shines from base to summit â the rocks streams lakes falls and the forests of silver fir â the national park and silver pine and how bright is the shining after summer showers and nights and after frosty nights in spring and autumn when the morning are pouring through the on

bringing forth their fragrance the wonderful weather and beauty inspire everybody to be up and doing every summer day is a to be confidently counted on the short of rain forming not but rests the big blessed storm days of winter when the whole range stands white are not a whit less inspiring and kind well may the be called the range of light not the snowy range for only in winter is it white while the year it is bright of this glorious range the national park is a central section thirty six miles in length and forty eight miles in breadth the valley lies in the heart of it and it the head waters of the our national and rivers two of the most streams in the world innumerable lakes and and smooth the noblest forests the granite the deepest ice the brightest and snowy mountains soaring into the twelve and thirteen thousand feet arrayed in open ranks and groups partially separated by tremendous and gardens on their sunny brows thundering down their long white slopes roaring gray and foaming in the crooked rugged and in their shadowy recesses working in silence slowly their new bom lakes at their feet blue and green free or with drifting like miniature as stars nowhere will you see the majestic operations of nature more clearly revealed beside the most gentle and peaceful things nearly all the park is a profound solitude it is full of charming company fuu of god s thoughts a place of peace and safety amid the 
95,most exalted grandeur and eager enthusiastic action a new of in first lessons on life mountain building eternal invincible order with sermons in stones storms trees flowers and animals of humanity during the last period just the national past the former features of the range were off as a chalk sketch from a and a new beginning was made hence the wonder f al clearness and freshness of the rocky pages but to get all this into words is a hopeless task the sketch of each feature would need a whole chapter nor would any amount of space however be of much avail to town in magazine articles are like pictures of bread to the hungry i can write only hints to good to come to the feast while this glorious park embraces big generous of the very best of the treasures it is fortunately at the same time the most accessible portion it lies opposite san at a distance of about one hundred and forty miles connected with all the continent reach into the and three good carriage roads from big oak flat and run into valley another called the road runs from s station on the big oak flat road near the big tree grove right across the park to the summit of the range by way of lake the big meadows and mount these roads with many that from valley bring most of the park within reach of everybody well or half well v national the three main natural divisions of the park the lower middle and regions are fairly well defined in features and vegetation the lower with an average elevation of about five thousand feet is the r on of the great forests made up of sugar pine the largest and most beautiful of au the pines in the world the silvery yellow pine the next in rank the white and red silver and the or big tree the king of the noblest of a noble race on warm slopes next the there are a few nut pines oaks make beautiful groves in the valleys and laurel and s shade the banks of the streams many of the pines are more than two hundred feet high but they are not crowded together the streaming through their arches the ground and you walk beneath the radiant ceiling in devout subdued mood as if you were in a cathedral wiu mellow h tj r l a while the open in every direction scarcely a peak or ridge in the whole region rises bare above the forests though they are planted in some places where the soil is shallow from the cool heights you look abroad over a boundless waving sea of covering the national park hill and ridge and smooth flowing slope as far as the eye can reach and filling every hollow and down in glorious triumphant perhaps the best general view of the pine forests of the park and one of the best in the range is obtained from the top of the and divide near green on the long smooth finely folded slopes of the main ridge at a height of five to six thousand feet above the sea they reach most perfect development and are to view in magnificent towering ranks their colossal and and broad crowns deep in the kind sky rising above one another â a multitude of giants in perfect health and beauty â sun fed rejoicing in their strength with the winds in accord with the falling waters the ground is mostly open and inviting to the fragrant is in rich carpets miles in extent the in orchard like groves covered with pink bell shaped flowers in the spring grows in facing the sun and in the warm brows are purple with yellow with and and tall lilies ring their bells around the borders of meadows and along the banks of the streams never was mountain forest more f our national green is a good place quietly to camp and study to get acquainted with the trees and to drink the water and weather and to watch the changing lights of the charmed days the rose light of the dawn creeping higher among the stars changes to yellow then come the level enthusiastic pouring across the touching pine after pine and fir and searching every recess until au are awakened and warmed in the white noon they in silvery splendor every needle and cell in and branch thrilling and with ardent life and the whole landscape with consciousness like the ce of a god the hours go by the evening flames with purple and gold the breeze that has been blowing from the dies away and far and near the host of trees in the purple flood stand hushed and thoughtful awaiting the sun s blessing and farewell â as impressive a ceremony as if it were never to rise again when the daylight the night breeze from the snowy begins to blow and the trees waving and rustling beneath the stars breathe free again it is hard to leave such and woods nevertheless to the large majority of the middle region of the park is still more interesting for it has the most striking features of the national park all the scenery â the deepest sections of the famous of which the valley valley and many smaller ones are wider portions with level floors and walls of immense height and grandeur of this middle region holds also the greater number of the beautiful lakes and meadows the great granite and the most brilliant and most extensive of the and though in large part it is severely rocky and bare it is still rich in trees the magnificent silver fir y which ranks with the giants forms a continuous belt across the park above the pines at an elevation of from seven to nine thousand feet and north and south of the park boundaries to the of the range 
95,only interrupted by the main the two or pine makes another less regular belt along the upper margin of the region while between these two and mingling with them in groves or scattered are the mountain the most graceful of the noble mountain pine the form of the yellow pine with big and long needles and the brown sturdy western all these except the which grows on bald rocks have plenty of brush about them and gardens in open spaces here too the broad shining heavily i national region ol which best tells the story of the on the pacific side of tiie continent no other mountain chain on the globe as far as i know is so rich as the in bold striking weu preserved monuments easily understood by anybody capable of patient observation every feature is more or less and this park portion of the range is the brightest and of all not a peak ridge dome lake basin garden forest or stream but in some way e the past existence and modes of action of flowing grinding soil making scenery making ice for the air rain frost rivers â have been at work upon the greater part of the range for of thousands of stormy years their own characters over of the ice the latter are so heavily and enduring they still rise in sublime relief clear and l ble through every after inscription the streams have traced only shallow wrinkles as yet and wind and u ng â w h â mâ â d but the change effected on the face of tiie landscape is not g than is made on the face of a by a single year of of all tile phenomena presented here the most striking and attractive to are the polished because are so the national park beautiful and their beauty is of so rare a kind â unlike any part of the loose where people dwell and earn their bread they are simply or gently of solid resisting granite the unchanged surface over which the ancient flowed they are found in the most perfect condition at an elevation of from eight to nine thousand feet above sea level some are miles in extent only slightly or by spots that have at last yielded to the weather while the best preserved portions are brilliantly polished and reflect the rubbed and every day notwithstanding they have been exposed to rains dew frost and melting for thousands of years the attention of hunters and who see so much in their wild journeys is seldom attracted by however regular and artificial or rocks however boldly or however deep and sheer walled but when they come to these they go down on their knees and rub their hands on the glistening surface and try hard to account for its mysterious and brightness they may have seen the winter come down the mountains through the woods sweeping away the trees and the ground but they conclude that this our national cannot be the work of because the show that the agent whatever it was flowed along and around and over the top of high and and also filled the deep neither can they see how water could be the agent for the strange polish is found thousands of feet above the reach of any conceivable flood only the winds seem capable of moving over the face of the country in the directions indicated by the lines and the are particularly fine around lake and have suggested the indian name we the lake of the shining indians seldom trouble themselves with questions but a indian once came to me and asked if i could tell him what made the rocks so smooth at even dogs and horses on their first journeys into this region study to the extent of gazing at the strange brightness of the ground and it and smelling it as if a aid of falling or sinking in the production of this admirable hard finish the in many places exerted a pressure of more than a hundred tons to the square foot down granite slate and alike showing their structure and making beautiful where large form the greater part of the rock on such the sunshine is at times as if the surface were of silver the national park here also are the brightest of the in general the regions lying at the same elevation to the north and south were perhaps subjected to as long and intense a but because the rocks are less resisting their polished have mostly given way to the weather leaving here and there only small imperfect patches on the most enduring portions of walls protected from the action of rain and snow and on hard kept comparatively dry by the short inclined of the east flank of the range are in some places brightly polished but they are far less magnificent than those of the broad west flank one of the best general views of the middle region of the park is to be had from the top of a majestic dome which long ago i named the monument it is situated a few miles to the north of cathedral peak and rises to a height of about fifteen hundred feet above its base and ten thousand above the sea at first sight it seems sternly inaccessible but a good will find that it may be on the south side approaching it from this side you pass through a dense fringed grove of mountain catching now and then of the colossal dome towering to an immense height above the dark and when at last you have made your way across woods through and you step abruptly out of the tree shadows and our national leafy softness upon a bare pavement and behold the dome in all its grandeur fancy a nicely monument eight or ten feet high from one stone standing in a pleasure ground it to a height 
96,of fifteen hundred feet retaining its of form and and cover its surface with then you may gain an idea of the and beauty of this ice dome one of many this wonderful park in making the ascent one finds that the curve of the base rapidly until one is in danger of slipping but two or three inches long that have been into relief afford slight the summit is in part like the sides and base the and indicating that the mighty two or three thousand feet deep overwhelmed it while it stood firm like a at the bottom of a river the pressure it must have been enormous it been less built it would have been md â d into f like the general mass of the mountain flank in which at first it lay for it is only a hard or knot with a structure of superior strength brought into relief by the removal of the less resisting rock about it â an illustration in stone of the of the strongest and most situated the national park hardly less wonderful when we contemplate the storms it has encountered since first it saw the light is its present condition the whole quantity of wear and tear it has suffered has not diminished its stature a single inch as may be shown by measuring from the level of the unchanged polished portions of the surface indeed the average of the entire region measured in the same way is found to be less than two inches â a mighty contrast to that of the ice for the here has been not less than a mile that is in developing the present an amount of rock a mile in average thickness has been silently carried away by flowing ice during the last period a few nicely poised on the rounded summit of the monument tell an interesting story they came from a mountain on the crest of the range about twelve miles to the eastward floating like on the frozen sea and were here when the top of the monument emerged to the light of day while the companions of these whose positions chanced to be over the slopes where they could not find rest were carried farther on by the current the general view from the summit consists of a sublime assemblage of mountains and rocks and long wavering lakes and national streams and meadows in wide sweeping and beds covered and dotted with forests and â

which now covers the continent of and of all the vast landscape now shining in the sun he would have seen only the tops of the summit peaks rising darkly like storm beaten islands lifeless and hopeless above rock ice waves if among the agents that nature has employed in making these mountains there be one that above all others deserves the name of it is the but we quickly learn that destruction is creation during the dreary centuries through which the lay in darkness crushed beneath the ice folds of die winter there was a steady invincible advance toward the warm life and beauty of to day and it is the national park where the crushed most that the greatest amount of is made manifest but as these have succeeded the so they in turn are giving place to others already planned and foreseen the granite and apparently we as of while these crumbling peaks down whose frosty are ever falling are of change and decay yet all alike fast or slow are surely vanishing away nature is ever at work building and pulling down creating and destroying keeping everything whirling and flowing allowing no rest but in motion chasing everything in endless song out of one beautiful form into another chapter iv thb forests of the the forests of the park and of the in general all others of their kind in america or indeed in the world not only in the size and beauty of the trees but in the

some of nature s forests the adventurous seems a feeble unwelcome creature wild beasts and the weather trying to kill him the rank tangled vegetation armed with and needles his way and making life a hard struggle here everything is hospitable and kind as if planned for your pleasure the forests of the park to every want of body and soul even the storms are friendly and seem to regard you as a brother their beauty and tremendous earnestness charming alike but the weather is mostly sunshine both winter and summer and the clear sunny brightness of the park is one of its most striking characteristics even the heaviest portions of the main forest belt where the trees are and stand are not in the least gloomy the sunshine falls in glory through the colossal and crowns each a symbol of health and strength the noble shafts faithfully upright like the pillars of temples a roof of infinite leafy inter arches and fretted the more open portions are like spacious with small shrubs or only with the fallen needles sprinkled here and there with flowers in some places where the ground is level or slopes gently the trees are assembled in groves and the flowers and in trim beds and as in landscape gardens or the lovingly planted grounds of homes or they are drawn up in or rows around meadows and lakes and along the brows of but in general the forests are distributed in wide in accordance with climate and the comparative strength of each kind in gaining and holding possession of the ground while anything like monotonous is prevented by the varied national and by the arrangement of the best in intricate patterns like for these are the of ancient o â u ed by we aâ ru g and v action and the trees trace them over the hills and and far up the sides of the mountains rising with even growth on and towering above one another on the long rich slopes prepared for them by the vanished had the forests been the most valuable of them would ere this have fallen a prey to the thus far the of the coast mountains and the of and washington have been more available for than the pine of the it cost less to go a thousand miles up the coast for timber where the trees came down to the shores of rivers and than fifty miles up the mountains nevertheless the superior value of the sugar pine for many purposes has tempted to large sums on and to reach the best forests though perhaps none of these has paid fortunately the lately established system of and has put a stop to any great of the business in its most destructive forms and as the park region has escaped the and the all devouring v i the forests of the park of have heen banished it is still in the main a pure wilderness unbroken by axe except on the lower margin where a few have opened spots beside hay meadows for their and gardens but these are mere of cultivation in no disturbing the grand solitude twenty or thirty years ago a good many trees were for their seeds traces of this method of seed collecting are still visible along the but these as well as the ruins are being rapidly overgrown the gardens and beds of once by sheep are blooming again in all their wild glory and the park is a paradise that makes even the loss of seem insignificant on the way to valley you get some grand views over the forests of the and and glimpses of some of the finest trees by the roadside without leaving your seat in the stage but to learn how they live and behave in pure to see them in their varying aspects through the seasons and weather rejoicing in the great storms in the spiritual mountain light putting forth their new leaves and flowers when all the streams are in flood and the birds are singing and sending away their seeds in the thoughtful indian summer when all the landscape is glowing in deep calm enthusiasm â for this you must love them national and live them as free from schemes and cares and time as the trees themselves and surely nobody will find anything hard in this even the blind must enjoy these woods their f to the music flowers and and and richly the kind of study required is as easy and natural as breathing without any great knowledge of or wood craft in a single season you may learn the name and something more of nearly every kind of tree in the park with few exceptions all the trees are growing in the park â nine species of pine two of silver fir one each of and â sixteen in all and about the same number of round headed trees oaks laurel etc the first of the you meet in going up the range from the west is the nut pine a remarkably open airy tree forty to sixty feet h long green foliage and large at a height of fifteen to thirty feet from the ground the trunk usually into several main branches which after bearing away from one another shoot straight up and form separate heads as if the of the tree had been broken the forests of the park while the secondary branches divide again and again into rather slender loosely with leaves eight 
96,to twelve inches long the yellow and flowers are about an inch long the in clusters the big rough five to eight or ten inches in length and five or six in are rich brown in color when ripe and full of hard nuts that are greatly by indians and this strange looking pine enjoying hot sunshine like a palm is along the part of the among small oaks and and with its gray mist of foliage strong trunk and branches and big seen in relief on the glowing sky forms the most striking feature of the vegetation is a small slender tree with pale green leaves in clustered flowers half an inch long yellow and crimson and in conspicuous clusters around the branches and also around the trunk the never fall off or open until the tree dies they are about four inches long exceedingly strong and solid and with hard a and almost worm and proof in which the seeds are kept fresh and safe during lifetime of the tree sometimes one of the trunk is overgrown and in the heart wood like a knot but nearly all are pushed out and national kept on the surface by the pressure of the successive of wood against the base this admirable little tree grows on slopes which from their position and the character of the vegetation are most frequently fire swept these grounds it is able to hold against all comers however big and strong by saving its seeds until death when all it has produced are scattered over the bare cleared ground and a new generation quickly springs out of the ashes thus the curious fact that all the trees of extensive groves and are of the same age is accounted for and their slender habit for the lavish abundance of seed sown at the same time makes a crowded growth and the with an even start rush up in a hurried race for light and life only a few of the and pines are within the boundaries of the park the former on the side of the the latter on the walls of valley and in the below it the nut pine is a small hardy contented looking tree about fifteen or twenty feet high and a foot in in its youth the close and branches form a handsome broad based but when grown it becomes round and irregular throwing out crooked limbs like an apple tree the leaves are pale the forests of the park green about an inch and a half long and instead of being divided into clusters they are single round sharp pointed and rigid like amid which in the spring the red flowers glow brightly the are only about two inches in length and breadth but nearly half of their bulk is made up of sweet nuts this fruitful uttle pine grows on the dry east side of the park along the margin of the sage plain and is the commonest tree of the short mountain of the great basin of thousands of acres are covered with it forming for the red man being so low and accessible the are easily beaten off with poles and the nuts procured by until the scales open to the tribes of the desert and sage plains these seeds are the staff of life they are eaten either raw or or in the form of or cakes after into meal the time of nut harvest in the autumn ib the indian s time of all the year an can gather fifty or sixty in a single month before the snow comes and then their bread for the winter is sure the white pine is widely distributed through the rocky mountains and the of the great basin where in many places it grows to a good size and is an important timber tree where none better is to be found in our national the park it is scattered along the eastern flank of the range from pass southward above the nut pine at an elevation of from eight to ten thousand feet to a tangled bush near the timber line but under favorable conditions a height of forty or fifty feet with a of three to five the long branches show a tendency to sweep out in bold curves like those of the mountain and sugar pines to which it is closely related the needles are in clusters of five closely packed on the ends of the the are about five inches long â the smaller ones nearly oval the but the most interesting feature of the tree is its bloom the vivid red flowers glowing among the leaves like coals of fire the pine or white pine is sure to interest every observer on account of its curious low habit and the great height on the snowy mountains at which it bravely grows it forms the extreme edge of the timber line on both of the summit mountains â if so lowly a tree can be called timber â at an elevation of ten to twelve thousand feet above the level of the sea where it is first met on the lower limit of its range it may be thirty or forty feet high but farther up the rocky wind swept slopes where the snow lies deep and heavy for six months of the year it makes shaggy the of the park and beds and pressed flat over which you can easily walk nevertheless in this crushed down pressed condition it to ufe

johnson i saw at what they called a wood which i took for heath if you show me what i shall take for it will be something the mountain pine is far the largest of tiie tree climbing nearly as high as the dwarf it is still a giant in size bold and strong standing erect on the storm beaten peaks and tossing its laden branches in the rough winds living a thousand years and reaching its greatest size â ninety to a hundred feet in height six to eight in â just where other trees its companions are but it is not able to endure burial in snow so long as the and therefore on the upper limit of its range it is found on slopes which from their or exposure are least snowy its soft ul beauty in youth and its leaves and branches constantly remind you of the sugar pine to which it is closely allied

97,not so as the but in june and july when the young bright yellow leaves appear the entire tree seems to be covered with bloom it is this grand tree that forms the forests of western washington and

time trying to determine their age but on account of dry rot which most of the old ones i never got a complete count of the largest some are undoubtedly more than two thousand years old for though on good soil they grow about as fast as oaks on bare and smoothly granite in the dome region they grow extremely slowly one on the king ridge only two feet eleven inches in was eleven hundred and forty years old another on the same ridge only one foot seven and a half inches in had reached the age of eight hundred and thirty four years the first fifteen inches from the bark of a medium sized tree â six feet in â on the north pavement had eight hundred and fifty nine of wood or fifty seven to the the forests of the park â inch beyond this the count was stopped by dry rot and of old wounds the largest i examined was three feet in or nearly ten in and though i failed to get anything like a complete count i learned enough from this and many other specimens to convince me that most of the trees eight to ten feet thick standing on are more than twenty of age rather than less accidents for all i can see they would live forever when killed they waste out of existence about as slowly as granite even when by after standing so long they refuse to lie at rest leaning on their big elbows as if anxious to rise and while a single root holds to the rock putting forth fresh leaves with a say

to him the forests op the park the poor bit of time was soon spent and while the were being adjusted i again urged to stay you are yourself a i said stop and get acquainted with your big brethren but he was past his prime and was now as a child in the hands of his affectionate but sadly civilized friends who seemed as full of old fashioned as of bold intellectual independence it was the afternoon

after all the rest of the party were over and out of sight he turned his horse took off his hat and waved me a last good by i felt lonely so sure had i been that of all men would be the to see the mountains and sing them gazing awhile on the spot where he vanished i sauntered back into the heart of the grove made a bed of and by the side of a stream gathered a store of and then walked about until the birds etc that had kept out of sight came our national me now that all was quiet and made cheer after i built a great fire and as usual had it all to myself and though for the first time in these forests i quickly took heart again â the trees had not gone to boston nor the birds and as i sat by the fire was still with me in spirit though i never again saw him in the flesh he sent books and wrote cheering me on advised me not to stay too long in solitude soon he hoped that my guardian angel would that my was at a close then i was to roll up my sketches and poems though i never knew i had any poems and come to his house and when i tired of him and his humble surroundings he would show me to better people but there remained many a forest to wander through many a mountain and to cross before i was to see his and boston and it was seventeen years after our parting on the ridge that i stood beside his grave under a pine tree on the hill above sleepy hollow he had gone to higher

100,with a bear we were fr and embarrassed both of us but the bear s behavior was better than mine when i discovered him he was standing in a narrow strip of meadow and i was concealed behind a tree on the side of it after studying his appearance as he stood at rest i rushed toward him to frighten him that i might study his gait in running but contrary to all i had heard about the shyness of bears he did not run at all and when i stopped short within a few steps of him as he held his ground in a fighting attitude my mistake was plain i was then put on my good behavior and never afterward forgot the right manners of the wilderness this happened on my first excursion in the forest to the north of valley i was eager to meet the animals and many of them came to me as if willing to show themselves and make my acquaintance but the bears kept out of my way an old in reply to my questions told me that bears were very shy all save grim old and that i might travel the mountains for years without seeing one unless i gave among the animals of the my mind to them and the stealthy ways of hunters nevertheless it was only a few weeks after i had received this information that i met the one mentioned above and obtained instruction at first hand i was in the woods about a mile back of the rim of beside a stream that falls into the valley by the way of indian nearly every day for weeks i went to the top of the north dome to sketch for it commands a general view of the and i was anxious to draw every tree and rock and a st dog was my companion â a fine intelligent fellow that belonged to a hunter who was compelled to remain all summer on the hot plains and who him to me for the season for the sake of having him in the mountains where he would be so much better off knew bears through long experience and he it was who led me to my first interview though he seemed as much surprised as the bear at my like behavior one morning in june the began to stream through the trees i set out for a day s on the dome and before we had gone half a mile from camp the air and looked cautiously ahead lowered tail drooped his ears and began to step softly like a cat turning every few yards and looking me in the face with a telling saying plainly enough â there is a bear a our national little way ahead i walked carefully in the indicated direction until i approached a small meadow that i was familiar with then crawled to the foot of a tree on its margin bearing in mind what i had been told about the shyness of bears looking out cautiously over the of the tree i saw a big bear about thirty yards off half erect his resting on the trunk of a fir that had fallen into the meadow his buried in grass and flowers he was listening attentively and trying to catch the scent showing that in some way he was aware of our approach i watched his gestures and tried to make the most of my opportunity to learn what i could about him fearing he would not stay lone he made a fine picture the most beautiful in the world after examining him at leisure noting the sharp thrust forward the long shaggy hair on broad chest the stiff ears nearly buried in hair and the slow heavy way in which he moved his head i foolishly made a rush on him throwing up my arms an to frighten him to see him run he did not mind the demonstration much only pushed his head farther forward and looked at me sharply as if asking what now if you want to fight i m ready then i began to fear that on me would fall the work of running but i was afraid to among the animals of the run lest he be encouraged to pursue me therefore i held my ground staring him in the face within a dozen yards or so putting on as bold a look as i could and hoping the influence of the human eye would be as great as it is said to be under these strained relations the view seemed to last a long time finally the bear seeing how still i was calmly withdrew his huge from the log gave me a piercing look as if warning me not to follow him turned and walked slowly up the middle of the meadow into the f or est stopping every few steps and looking back to make sure that i was not trying to take him at a disadvantage in a rear attack i was glad to part with hun and greatly enjoyed the vanishing view as he through the lilies and i always tried to give bears respectful notice of my approach and they usually kept well out of my way though they often came around my camp in the night only once afterward as far as i know was i very near one of them in daylight this time it was a i met and as luck would have it i was even nearer to him than i had been to the big though not a large specimen he seemed formidable enough at a distance of less than a dozen yards his shaggy coat was well his head almost white when i first caught sight of him he was eating our national under a oak at a distance of perhaps seventy five yards and i tried to slip past without disturbing him but he 
100,had either heard my steps on the gravel or caught my scent for he came straight toward me stopping every rod or so to look and listen and as i was afraid to be seen running i crawled on my hands and knees a little way to one side and hid behind a hoping he would pass me unnoticed he soon came up opposite me and stood looking ahead while i looked at him peering past the trunk of the tree at last turning j d be c â h right ot â i sharply a minute or two and then with fine dignity disappeared in a covered earthquake considering how heavy and broad footed are it is wonderful how httle harm they do in the wilderness even in the well watered gardens of the middle region where the flowers g w and where daring warm weather the bears and roll no of destruction is visible on the contrary under nature s direction the massive he tl as on the forest floor with needles and brush and on the tough sod of meadows bears make no mark but around the sandy margin of lakes their magnificent tracks form grand lines of their well worn extend along the main on either side and among the animals of the dusty in some places make no on the landscape they bite and break off the branches of some of the pines and oaks to get the nuts but this is so light that few ever notice it and though they interfere with the orderly veiled decay of fallen trees tearing them to pieces to reach the colonies of that them the scattered ruins are quickly pressed back into harmony by snow and rain and over leaning vegetation the number of bears that make the park their home may be guessed by the number that have been killed by the two best hunters and old david brown began to be known as a bear about the year he was then the woods hunting and on the south fork of the a friend told me that he killed his first bear near his cabin at that after courage to fire he fled without waiting to learn the effect of his shot going back in a few hours he found poor dead and gained courage to try again confessed to me when we made an excursion together in that he was at first afraid of bears but after killing a half dozen he began to keep count of his victims and became ambitious to be known as a great bear hunter in nine years he had killed forty nine keeping count by cut on one of the of his cabin on the shore of our national cent lake near the south boundary of the park he said the more he knew about bears the more he respected them and the less he feared but at the same time he grew more and more cautious and never fired until he had every advantage no matter how long he had to wait and how far he had to go before he got the bear just right as to the direction of the wind the distance and the way of escape in case of accident making allowance also for the character of the animal old or young or for old he said he had no use whatever and he was mighty careful to avoid their acquaintance he wanted to kill an even hundred then he was going to confine himself to safer game there was not much money in bears anyhow and a round hundred was enough for glory i have not seen or heard of him lately and do not know how his bloody count stands on my excursions i occasionally passed his cabin it was full of meat and skins hung in bundles from the and the ground about it was strewn with bones and hair â infinitely less tidy than a bear s den he went as hunter and guide with a survey party for a year or two and was very proud of the scientific knowledge he picked up his admiring fellow he said gave him credit for knowing not only the names of all the trees and among the animals of the bushes but also the names of the bears the most famous hunter of the region was david brown an old who early in the gold period established his main camp in a little forest on the north fork of the which is still called brown s hat no finer solitude for a hunter and could be found the climate is delightful all the year and the scenery of both earth and sky is a perpetual feast though he was not much of a scenery fellow friends say that he knew a pretty place when he saw it as well as any one and liked to get on the top of a commanding ridge to look off when out of provisions he would take down his old fashioned long rifle from its deer horn rest over the fireplace and set out in search of game seldom did he have to go far for because the deer liked the wooded slopes of pilot peak ridge with its open spots where they could rest and look about them and enjoy the se from the sea in warm weather free from troublesome flies while they found hiding places and fine food in the deer brush a small wise dog was his only companion and well the little understood the object of every hunt whether deer or bears or only hidden in the fir tops in deer hunting sandy had little to do trotting behind our national his master as he walked noiselessly the fragrant woods careful not to step heavily on dry twigs open spots in the where the deer feed in the early morning and toward sunset peering
