1|Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
1|Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
1|Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
1|And summer's lease hath all too short a date;
2|Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
2|And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;
2|And every fair from fair sometime declines,
2|By chance or natureâ€™s changing course untrimm'd;
3|But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
3|Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st;
3|Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,
3|When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st:
