 oh mr lydgate you know well what your advantages are you know that our young men here cannot cope with you where you frequent a house it may militate very much against a girl s making a desirable settlement in life and prevent her from accepting offers even if they are made lydgate was less flattered by his advantage over the middlemarch orlandos than he was annoyed by the perception of mrs bulstrode s meaning she felt that she had spoken as impressively as it was necessary to do and that in using the superior word militate she had thrown a noble drapery over a mass of particulars which were still evident enough lydgate was fuming a little pushed his hair back with one hand felt curiously in his waistcoat pocket with the other and then stooped to beckon the tiny black spaniel which had the insight to decline his hollow caresses it would not have been decent to go away because he had been dining with other guests and had just taken tea but mrs bulstrode having no doubt that she had been understood turned the conversation solomon s proverbs i think have omitted to say that as the sore palate findeth grit so an uneasy consciousness heareth innuendoes the next day mr farebrother parting from lydgate in the street supposed that they should meet at vincy s in the evening lydgate answered curtly no he had work to do he must give up going out in the evening what you are going to get lashed to the mast eh and are stopping your ears said the vicar well if you don t mean to be won by the sirens you are right to take precautions in time a few days before lydgate would have taken no notice of these words as anything more than the vicar s usual way of putting things they seemed now to convey an innuendo which confirmed the impression that he had been making a fool of himself and behaving so as to be misunderstood not he believed by rosamond herself she he felt sure took everything as lightly as he intended it she had an exquisite tact and insight in relation to all points of manners but the people she lived among were blunderers and busybodies however the mistake should go no farther he resolved and kept his resolution that he would not go to mr vincy s except on business rosamond became very unhappy the uneasiness first stirred by her aunt s questions grew and grew till at the end of ten days that she had not seen lydgate it grew into terror at the blank that might possibly come into foreboding of that ready fatal sponge which so cheaply wipes out the hopes of mortals the world would have a new dreariness for her as a wilderness that a magician s spells had turned for a little while into a garden she felt that she was beginning to know the pang of disappointed love and that no other man could be the occasion of such delightful aerial building as she had been enjoying for the last six months poor rosamond lost her appetite and felt as forlorn as ariadne as a charming stage ariadne left behind with all her boxes full of costumes and no hope of a coach there are many wonderful mixtures in the world which are all alike called love and claim the privileges of a sublime rage which is an apology for everything in literature and the drama happily rosamond did not think of committing any desperate act she plaited her fair hair as beautifully as usual and kept herself proudly calm her most cheerful supposition was that her aunt bulstrode had interfered in some way to hinder lydgate s visits everything was better than a spontaneous indifference in him any one who imagines ten days too short a time not for falling into leanness lightness or other measurable effects of passion but for the whole spiritual circuit of alarmed conjecture and disappointment is ignorant of what can go on in the elegant leisure of a young lady s mind on the eleventh day however lydgate when leaving stone court was requested by mrs vincy to let her husband know that there was a marked change in mr featherstone s health and that she wished him to come to stone court on that day now lydgate might have called at the warehouse or might have written a message on a leaf of his pocket book and left it at the door yet these simple devices apparently did not occur to him from which we may conclude that he had no strong objection to calling at the house at an hour when mr vincy was not at home and leaving the message with miss vincy a man may from various motives decline to give his company but perhaps not even a sage would be gratified that nobody missed him it would be a graceful easy way of piecing on the new habits to the old to have a few playful words with rosamond about his resistance to dissipation and his firm resolve to take long fasts even from sweet sounds it must be confessed also that momentary speculations as to all the possible grounds for mrs bulstrode s hints had managed to get woven like slight clinging hairs into the more substantial web of his thoughts miss vincy was alone and blushed so deeply when lydgate came in that he felt a corresponding embarrassment and instead of any playfulness he began at once to speak of his reason for calling and to beg her almost formally to deliver the message to her father rosamond who at the first moment felt as if her happiness were returning was keenly hurt by lydgate s manner her blush had departed and she assented coldly without adding an unnecessary word some trivial chain work which she had in her hands enabling her to avoid looking at lydgate higher than his chin in all failures the beginning is certainly the half of the whole after sitting two long moments while he moved his whip and could say nothing lydgate rose to go and rosamond made nervous by her struggle between mortification and the wish not to betray it dropped her chain as if startled and rose too mechanically lydgate instantaneously stooped to pick up the chain when he rose he was very near to a lovely little face set on a fair long neck which he had been used to see turning about under the most perfect management of self contented grace but as he raised his eyes now he saw a certain helpless quivering which touched him quite newly and made him look at rosamond with a questioning flash at this moment she was as natural as she had ever been when she was five years old she felt that her tears had risen and it was no use to try to do anything else than let them stay like water on a blue flower or let them fall over her cheeks even as they would that moment of naturalness was the crystallizing feather touch it shook flirtation into love remember that the ambitious man who was looking at those forget me nots under the water was very warm hearted and rash he did not know where the chain went an idea had thrilled through the recesses within him which had a miraculous effect in raising the power of passionate love lying buried there in no sealed sepulchre but under the lightest easily pierced mould his words were quite abrupt and awkward but the tone made them sound like an ardent appealing avowal what is the matter you are distressed tell me pray rosamond had never been spoken to in such tones before i am not sure that she knew what the words were but she looked at lydgate and the tears fell over her cheeks there could have been no more complete answer than that silence and lydgate forgetting everything else completely mastered by the outrush of tenderness at the sudden belief that this sweet young creature depended on him for her joy actually put his arms round her folding her gently and protectingly he was used to being gentle with the weak and suffering and kissed each of the two large tears this was a strange way of arriving at an understanding but it was a short way rosamond was not angry but she moved backward a little in timid happiness and lydgate could now sit near her and speak less incompletely rosamond had to make her little confession and he poured out words of gratitude and tenderness with impulsive lavishment in half an hour he left the house an engaged man whose soul was not his own but the woman s to whom he had bound himself he came again in the evening to speak with mr vincy who just returned from stone court was feeling sure that it would not be long before he heard of mr featherstone s demise the felicitous word demise which had seasonably occurred to him had raised his spirits even above their usual evening pitch the right word is always a power and communicates its definiteness to our action considered as a demise old featherstone s death assumed a merely legal aspect so that mr vincy could tap his snuff box over it and be jovial without even an intermittent affectation of solemnity and mr vincy hated both solemnity and affectation who was ever awe struck about a testator or sang a hymn on the title to real property mr vincy was inclined to take a jovial view of all things that evening he even observed to lydgate that fred had got the family constitution after all and would soon be as fine a fellow as ever again and when his approbation of rosamond s engagement was asked for he gave it with astonishing facility passing at once to general remarks on the desirableness of matrimony for young men and maidens and apparently deducing from the whole the appropriateness of a little more punch the triumphant confidence of the mayor founded on mr featherstone s insistent demand that fred and his mother should not leave him was a feeble emotion compared with all that was agitating the breasts of the old man s blood relations who naturally manifested more their sense of the family tie and were more visibly numerous now that he had become bedridden naturally for when poor peter had occupied his arm chair in the wainscoted parlor no assiduous beetles for whom the cook prepares boiling water could have been less welcome on a hearth which they had reasons for preferring than those persons whose featherstone blood was ill nourished not from penuriousness on their part but from poverty brother solomon and sister jane were rich and the family candor and total abstinence from false politeness with which they were always received seemed to them no argument that their brother in the solemn act of making his will would overlook the superior claims of wealth themselves at least he had never been unnatural enough to banish from his house and it seemed hardly eccentric that he should have kept away brother jonah sister martha and the rest who had no shadow of such claims they knew peter s maxim that money was a good egg and should be laid in a warm nest but brother jonah sister martha and all the needy exiles held a different point of view probabilities are as various as the faces to be seen at will in fretwork or paper hangings every form is there from jupiter to judy if you only look with creative inclination to the poorer and least favored it seemed likely that since peter had done nothing for them in his life he would remember them at the last jonah argued that men liked to make a surprise of their wills while martha said that nobody need be surprised if he left the best part of his money to those who least expected it also it was not to be thought but that an own brother lying there with dropsy in his legs must come to feel that blood was thicker than water and if he didn t alter his will he might have money by him at any rate some blood relations should be on the premises and on the watch against those who were hardly relations at all such things had been known as forged wills and disputed wills which seemed to have the golden hazy advantage of somehow enabling non legatees to live out of them again those who were no blood relations might be caught making away with things and poor peter lying there helpless somebody should be on the watch but in this conclusion they were at one with solomon and jane also some nephews nieces and cousins arguing with still greater subtilty as to what might be done by a man able to will away his property and give himself large treats of oddity felt in a handsome sort of way that there was a family interest to be attended to and thought of stone court as a place which it would be nothing but right for them to visit sister martha otherwise mrs cranch living with some wheeziness in the chalky flats could not undertake the journey but her son as being poor peter s own nephew could represent her advantageously and watch lest his uncle jonah should make an unfair use of the improbable things which seemed likely to happen in fact there was a general sense running in the featherstone blood that everybody must watch everybody else and that it would be well for everybody else to reflect that the almighty was watching him thus stone court continually saw one or other blood relation alighting or departing and mary garth had the unpleasant task of carrying their messages to mr featherstone who would see none of them and sent her down with the still more unpleasant task of telling them so as manager of the household she felt bound to ask them in good provincial fashion to stay and eat but she chose to consult mrs vincy on the point of extra down stairs consumption now that mr featherstone was laid up oh my dear you must do things handsomely where there s last illness and a property god knows i don t grudge them every ham in the house only save the best for the funeral have some stuffed veal always and a fine cheese in cut you must expect to keep open house in these last illnesses said liberal mrs vincy once more of cheerful note and bright plumage but some of the visitors alighted and did not depart after the handsome treating to veal and ham brother jonah for example there are such unpleasant people in most families perhaps even in the highest aristocracy there are brobdingnag specimens gigantically in debt and bloated at greater expense brother jonah i say having come down in the world was mainly supported by a calling which he was modest enough not to boast of though it was much better than swindling either on exchange or turf but which did not require his presence at brassing so long as he had a good corner to sit in and a supply of food he chose the kitchen corner partly because he liked it best and partly because he did not want to sit with solomon concerning whom he had a strong brotherly opinion seated in a famous arm chair and in his best suit constantly within sight of good cheer he had a comfortable consciousness of being on the premises mingled with fleeting suggestions of sunday and the bar at the green man and he informed mary garth that he should not go out of reach of his brother peter while that poor fellow was above ground the troublesome ones in a family are usually either the wits or the idiots jonah was the wit among the featherstones and joked with the maid servants when they came about the hearth but seemed to consider miss garth a suspicious character and followed her with cold eyes mary would have borne this one pair of eyes with comparative ease but unfortunately there was young cranch who having come all the way from the chalky flats to represent his mother and watch his uncle jonah also felt it his duty to stay and to sit chiefly in the kitchen to give his uncle company young cranch was not exactly the balancing point between the wit and the idiot verging slightly towards the latter type and squinting so as to leave everything in doubt about his sentiments except that they were not of a forcible character when mary garth entered the kitchen and mr jonah featherstone began to follow her with his cold detective eyes young cranch turning his head in the same direction seemed to insist on it that she should remark how he was squinting as if he did it with design like the gypsies when borrow read the new testament to them this was rather too much for poor mary sometimes it made her bilious sometimes it upset her gravity one day that she had an opportunity she could not resist describing the kitchen scene to fred who would not be hindered from immediately going to see it affecting simply to pass through but no sooner did he face the four eyes than he had to rush through the nearest door which happened to lead to the dairy and there under the high roof and among the pans he gave way to laughter which made a hollow resonance perfectly audible in the kitchen he fled by another doorway but mr jonah who had not before seen fred s white complexion long legs and pinched delicacy of face prepared many sarcasms in which these points of appearance were wittily combined with the lowest moral attributes why tom you don t wear such gentlemanly trousers you haven t got half such fine long legs said jonah to his nephew winking at the same time to imply that there was something more in these statements than their undeniableness tom looked at his legs but left it uncertain whether he preferred his moral advantages to a more vicious length of limb and reprehensible gentility of trouser in the large wainscoted parlor too there were constantly pairs of eyes on the watch and own relatives eager to be sitters up many came lunched and departed but brother solomon and the lady who had been jane featherstone for twenty five years before she was mrs waule found it good to be there every day for hours without other calculable occupation than that of observing the cunning mary garth who was so deep that she could be found out in nothing and giving occasional dry wrinkly indications of crying as if capable of torrents in a wetter season at the thought that they were not allowed to go into mr featherstone s room for the old man s dislike of his own family seemed to get stronger as he got less able to amuse himself by saying biting things to them too languid to sting he had the more venom refluent in his blood not fully believing the message sent through mary garth they had presented themselves together within the door of the bedroom both in black mrs waule having a white handkerchief partially unfolded in her hand and both with faces in a sort of half mourning purple while mrs vincy with her pink cheeks and pink ribbons flying was actually administering a cordial to their own brother and the light complexioned fred his short hair curling as might be expected in a gambler s was lolling at his ease in a large chair old featherstone no sooner caught sight of these funereal figures appearing in spite of his orders than rage came to strengthen him more successfully than the cordial he was propped up on a bed rest and always had his gold headed stick lying by him he seized it now and swept it backwards and forwards in as large an area as he could apparently to ban these ugly spectres crying in a hoarse sort of screech back back mrs waule back solomon oh brother peter mrs waule began but solomon put his hand before her repressingly he was a large cheeked man nearly seventy with small furtive eyes and was not only of much blander temper but thought himself much deeper than his brother peter indeed not likely to be deceived in any of his fellow men inasmuch as they could not well be more greedy and deceitful than he suspected them of being even the invisible powers he thought were likely to be soothed by a bland parenthesis here and there coming from a man of property who might have been as impious as others brother peter he said in a wheedling yet gravely official tone it s nothing but right i should speak to you about the three crofts and the manganese the almighty knows what i ve got on my mind then he knows more than i want to know said peter laying down his stick with a show of truce which had a threat in it too for he reversed the stick so as to make the gold handle a club in case of closer fighting and looked hard at solomon s bald head there s things you might repent of brother for want of speaking to me said solomon not advancing however i could sit up with you to night and jane with me willingly and you might take your own time to speak or let me speak yes i shall take my own time you needn t offer me yours said peter but you can t take your own time to die in brother began mrs waule with her usual woolly tone and when you lie speechless you may be tired of having strangers about you and you may think of me and my children but here her voice broke under the touching thought which she was attributing to her speechless brother the mention of ourselves being naturally affecting no i shan t said old featherstone contradictiously i shan t think of any of you i ve made my will i tell you i ve made my will here he turned his head towards mrs vincy and swallowed some more of his cordial some people would be ashamed to fill up a place belonging by rights to others said mrs waule turning her narrow eyes in the same direction oh sister said solomon with ironical softness you and me are not fine and handsome and clever enough we must be humble and let smart people push themselves before us fred s spirit could not bear this rising and looking at mr featherstone he said shall my mother and i leave the room sir that you may be alone with your friends sit down i tell you said old featherstone snappishly stop where you are good by solomon he added trying to wield his stick again but failing now that he had reversed the handle good by mrs waule don t you come again i shall be down stairs brother whether or no said solomon i shall do my duty and it remains to be seen what the almighty will allow yes in property going out of families said mrs waule in continuation and where there s steady young men to carry on but i pity them who are not such and i pity their mothers good by brother peter remember i m the eldest after you brother and prospered from the first just as you did and have got land already by the name of featherstone said solomon relying much on that reflection as one which might be suggested in the watches of the night but i bid you good by for the present their exit was hastened by their seeing old mr featherstone pull his wig on each side and shut his eyes with his mouth widening grimace as if he were determined to be deaf and blind none the less they came to stone court daily and sat below at the post of duty sometimes carrying on a slow dialogue in an undertone in which the observation and response were so far apart that any one hearing them might have imagined himself listening to speaking automata in some doubt whether the ingenious mechanism would really work or wind itself up for a long time in order to stick and be silent solomon and jane would have been sorry to be quick what that led to might be seen on the other side of the wall in the person of brother jonah but their watch in the wainscoted parlor was sometimes varied by the presence of other guests from far or near now that peter featherstone was up stairs his property could be discussed with all that local enlightenment to be found on the spot some rural and middlemarch neighbors expressed much agreement with the family and sympathy with their interest against the vincys and feminine visitors were even moved to tears in conversation with mrs waule when they recalled the fact that they themselves had been disappointed in times past by codicils and marriages for spite on the part of ungrateful elderly gentlemen who it might have been supposed had been spared for something better such conversation paused suddenly like an organ when the bellows are let drop if mary garth came into the room and all eyes were turned on her as a possible legatee or one who might get access to iron chests but the younger men who were relatives or connections of the family were disposed to admire her in this problematic light as a girl who showed much conduct and who among all the chances that were flying might turn out to be at least a moderate prize hence she had her share of compliments and polite attentions especially from mr borthrop trumbull a distinguished bachelor and auctioneer of those parts much concerned in the sale of land and cattle a public character indeed whose name was seen on widely distributed placards and who might reasonably be sorry for those who did not know of him he was second cousin to peter featherstone and had been treated by him with more amenity than any other relative being useful in matters of business and in that programme of his funeral which the old man had himself dictated he had been named as a bearer there was no odious cupidity in mr borthrop trumbull nothing more than a sincere sense of his own merit which he was aware in case of rivalry might tell against competitors so that if peter featherstone who so far as he trumbull was concerned had behaved like as good a soul as ever breathed should have done anything handsome by him all he could say was that he had never fished and fawned but had advised him to the best of his experience which now extended over twenty years from the time of his apprenticeship at fifteen and was likely to yield a knowledge of no surreptitious kind his admiration was far from being confined to himself but was accustomed professionally as well as privately to delight in estimating things at a high rate he was an amateur of superior phrases and never used poor language without immediately correcting himself which was fortunate as he was rather loud and given to predominate standing or walking about frequently pulling down his waistcoat with the air of a man who is very much of his own opinion trimming himself rapidly with his fore finger and marking each new series in these movements by a busy play with his large seals there was occasionally a little fierceness in his demeanor but it was directed chiefly against false opinion of which there is so much to correct in the world that a man of some reading and experience necessarily has his patience tried he felt that the featherstone family generally was of limited understanding but being a man of the world and a public character took everything as a matter of course and even went to converse with mr jonah and young cranch in the kitchen not doubting that he had impressed the latter greatly by his leading questions concerning the chalky flats if anybody had observed that mr borthrop trumbull being an auctioneer was bound to know the nature of everything he would have smiled and trimmed himself silently with the sense that he came pretty near that on the whole in an auctioneering way he was an honorable man not ashamed of his business and feeling that the celebrated peel now sir robert if introduced to him would not fail to recognize his importance i don t mind if i have a slice of that ham and a glass of that ale miss garth if you will allow me he said coming into the parlor at half past eleven after having had the exceptional privilege of seeing old featherstone and standing with his back to the fire between mrs waule and solomon it s not necessary for you to go out let me ring the bell thank you said mary i have an errand well mr trumbull you re highly favored said mrs waule what seeing the old man said the auctioneer playing with his seals dispassionately ah you see he has relied on me considerably here he pressed his lips together and frowned meditatively might anybody ask what their brother has been saying said solomon in a soft tone of humility in which he had a sense of luxurious cunning he being a rich man and not in need of it oh yes anybody may ask said mr trumbull with loud and good humored though cutting sarcasm anybody may interrogate any one may give their remarks an interrogative turn he continued his sonorousness rising with his style this is constantly done by good speakers even when they anticipate no answer it is what we call a figure of speech speech at a high figure as one may say the eloquent auctioneer smiled at his own ingenuity i shouldn t be sorry to hear he d remembered you mr trumbull said solomon i never was against the deserving it s the undeserving i m against ah there it is you see there it is said mr trumbull significantly it can t be denied that undeserving people have been legatees and even residuary legatees it is so with testamentary dispositions again he pursed up his lips and frowned a little do you mean to say for certain mr trumbull that my brother has left his land away from our family said mrs waule on whom as an unhopeful woman those long words had a depressing effect a man might as well turn his land into charity land at once as leave it to some people observed solomon his sister s question having drawn no answer what blue coat land said mrs waule again oh mr trumbull you never can mean to say that it would be flying in the face of the almighty that s prospered him while mrs waule was speaking mr borthrop trumbull walked away from the fireplace towards the window patrolling with his fore finger round the inside of his stock then along his whiskers and the curves of his hair he now walked to miss garth s work table opened a book which lay there and read the title aloud with pompous emphasis as if he were offering it for sale anne of geierstein pronounced jeersteen or the maiden of the mist by the author of waverley then turning the page he began sonorously the course of four centuries has well nigh elapsed since the series of events which are related in the following chapters took place on the continent he pronounced the last truly admirable word with the accent on the last syllable not as unaware of vulgar usage but feeling that this novel delivery enhanced the sonorous beauty which his reading had given to the whole and now the servant came in with the tray so that the moments for answering mrs waule s question had gone by safely while she and solomon watching mr trumbull s movements were thinking that high learning interfered sadly with serious affairs mr borthrop trumbull really knew nothing about old featherstone s will but he could hardly have been brought to declare any ignorance unless he had been arrested for misprision of treason i shall take a mere mouthful of ham and a glass of ale he said reassuringly as a man with public business i take a snack when i can i will back this ham he added after swallowing some morsels with alarming haste against any ham in the three kingdoms in my opinion it is better than the hams at freshitt hall and i think i am a tolerable judge some don t like so much sugar in their hams said mrs waule but my poor brother would always have sugar if any person demands better he is at liberty to do so but god
