and liked to give others their due feeling that he could afford it he had caught the words expectant method and rang chimes on this and other learned phrases to accompany the assurance that lydgate knew a thing or two more than the rest of the doctors was far better versed in the secrets of his profession than the majority of his compeers this had happened before the affair of fred vincy s illness had given to mr wrench s enmity towards lydgate more definite personal ground the new comer already threatened to be a nuisance in the shape of rivalry and was certainly a nuisance in the shape of practical criticism or reflections on his hard driven elders who had had something else to do than to busy themselves with untried notions his practice had spread in one or two quarters and from the first the report of his high family had led to his being pretty generally invited so that the other medical men had to meet him at dinner in the best houses and having to meet a man whom you dislike is not observed always to end in a mutual attachment there was hardly ever so much unanimity among them as in the opinion that lydgate was an arrogant young fellow and yet ready for the sake of ultimately predominating to show a crawling subservience to bulstrode that mr farebrother whose name was a chief flag of the anti bulstrode party always defended lydgate and made a friend of him was referred to farebrother s unaccountable way of fighting on both sides here was plenty of preparation for the outburst of professional disgust at the announcement of the laws mr bulstrode was laying down for the direction of the new hospital which were the more exasperating because there was no present possibility of interfering with his will and pleasure everybody except lord medlicote having refused help towards the building on the ground that they preferred giving to the old infirmary mr bulstrode met all the expenses and had ceased to be sorry that he was purchasing the right to carry out his notions of improvement without hindrance from prejudiced coadjutors but he had had to spend large sums and the building had lingered caleb garth had undertaken it had failed during its progress and before the interior fittings were begun had retired from the management of the business and when referring to the hospital he often said that however bulstrode might ring if you tried him he liked good solid carpentry and masonry and had a notion both of drains and chimneys in fact the hospital had become an object of intense interest to bulstrode and he would willingly have continued to spare a large yearly sum that he might rule it dictatorially without any board but he had another favorite object which also required money for its accomplishment he wished to buy some land in the neighborhood of middlemarch and therefore he wished to get considerable contributions towards maintaining the hospital meanwhile he framed his plan of management the hospital was to be reserved for fever in all its forms lydgate was to be chief medical superintendent that he might have free authority to pursue all comparative investigations which his studies particularly in paris had shown him the importance of the other medical visitors having a consultative influence but no power to contravene lydgate s ultimate decisions and the general management was to be lodged exclusively in the hands of five directors associated with mr bulstrode who were to have votes in the ratio of their contributions the board itself filling up any vacancy in its numbers and no mob of small contributors being admitted to a share of government there was an immediate refusal on the part of every medical man in the town to become a visitor at the fever hospital very well said lydgate to mr bulstrode we have a capital house surgeon and dispenser a clear headed neat handed fellow we ll get webbe from crabsley as good a country practitioner as any of them to come over twice a week and in case of any exceptional operation protheroe will come from brassing i must work the harder that s all and i have given up my post at the infirmary the plan will flourish in spite of them and then they ll be glad to come in things can t last as they are there must be all sorts of reform soon and then young fellows may be glad to come and study here lydgate was in high spirits i shall not flinch you may depend upon it mr lydgate said mr bulstrode while i see you carrying out high intentions with vigor you shall have my unfailing support and i have humble confidence that the blessing which has hitherto attended my efforts against the spirit of evil in this town will not be withdrawn suitable directors to assist me i have no doubt of securing mr brooke of tipton has already given me his concurrence and a pledge to contribute yearly he has not specified the sum probably not a great one but he will be a useful member of the board a useful member was perhaps to be defined as one who would originate nothing and always vote with mr bulstrode the medical aversion to lydgate was hardly disguised now neither dr sprague nor dr minchin said that he disliked lydgate s knowledge or his disposition to improve treatment what they disliked was his arrogance which nobody felt to be altogether deniable they implied that he was insolent pretentious and given to that reckless innovation for the sake of noise and show which was the essence of the charlatan the word charlatan once thrown on the air could not be let drop in those days the world was agitated about the wondrous doings of mr st john long noblemen and gentlemen attesting his extraction of a fluid like mercury from the temples of a patient mr toller remarked one day smilingly to mrs taft that bulstrode had found a man to suit him in lydgate a charlatan in religion is sure to like other sorts of charlatans yes indeed i can imagine said mrs taft keeping the number of thirty stitches carefully in her mind all the while there are so many of that sort i remember mr cheshire with his irons trying to make people straight when the almighty had made them crooked no no said mr toller cheshire was all right all fair and above board but there s st john long that s the kind of fellow we call a charlatan advertising cures in ways nobody knows anything about a fellow who wants to make a noise by pretending to go deeper than other people the other day he was pretending to tap a man s brain and get quicksilver out of it good gracious what dreadful trifling with people s constitutions said mrs taft after this it came to be held in various quarters that lydgate played even with respectable constitutions for his own purposes and how much more likely that in his flighty experimenting he should make sixes and sevens of hospital patients especially it was to be expected as the landlady of the tankard had said that he would recklessly cut up their dead bodies for lydgate having attended mrs goby who died apparently of a heart disease not very clearly expressed in the symptoms too daringly asked leave of her relatives to open the body and thus gave an offence quickly spreading beyond parley street where that lady had long resided on an income such as made this association of her body with the victims of burke and hare a flagrant insult to her memory affairs were in this stage when lydgate opened the subject of the hospital to dorothea we see that he was bearing enmity and silly misconception with much spirit aware that they were partly created by his good share of success they will not drive me away he said talking confidentially in mr farebrother s study i have got a good opportunity here for the ends i care most about and i am pretty sure to get income enough for our wants by and by i shall go on as quietly as possible i have no seductions now away from home and work and i am more and more convinced that it will be possible to demonstrate the homogeneous origin of all the tissues raspail and others are on the same track and i have been losing time i have no power of prophecy there said mr farebrother who had been puffing at his pipe thoughtfully while lydgate talked but as to the hostility in the town you ll weather it if you are prudent how am i to be prudent said lydgate i just do what comes before me to do i can t help people s ignorance and spite any more than vesalius could it isn t possible to square one s conduct to silly conclusions which nobody can foresee quite true i didn t mean that i meant only two things one is keep yourself as separable from bulstrode as you can of course you can go on doing good work of your own by his help but don t get tied perhaps it seems like personal feeling in me to say so and there s a good deal of that i own but personal feeling is not always in the wrong if you boil it down to the impressions which make it simply an opinion bulstrode is nothing to me said lydgate carelessly except on public grounds as to getting very closely united to him i am not fond enough of him for that but what was the other thing you meant said lydgate who was nursing his leg as comfortably as possible and feeling in no great need of advice why this take care experto crede take care not to get hampered about money matters i know by a word you let fall one day that you don t like my playing at cards so much for money you are right enough there but try and keep clear of wanting small sums that you haven t got i am perhaps talking rather superfluously but a man likes to assume superiority over himself by holding up his bad example and sermonizing on it lydgate took mr farebrother s hints very cordially though he would hardly have borne them from another man he could not help remembering that he had lately made some debts but these had seemed inevitable and he had no intention now to do more than keep house in a simple way the furniture for which he owed would not want renewing nor even the stock of wine for a long while many thoughts cheered him at that time and justly a man conscious of enthusiasm for worthy aims is sustained under petty hostilities by the memory of great workers who had to fight their way not without wounds and who hover in his mind as patron saints invisibly helping at home that same evening when he had been chatting with mr farebrother he had his long legs stretched on the sofa his head thrown back and his hands clasped behind it according to his favorite ruminating attitude while rosamond sat at the piano and played one tune after another of which her husband only knew like the emotional elephant he was that they fell in with his mood as if they had been melodious sea breezes there was something very fine in lydgate s look just then and any one might have been encouraged to bet on his achievement in his dark eyes and on his mouth and brow there was that placidity which comes from the fulness of contemplative thought the mind not searching but beholding and the glance seeming to be filled with what is behind it presently rosamond left the piano and seated herself on a chair close to the sofa and opposite her husband s face is that enough music for you my lord she said folding her hands before her and putting on a little air of meekness yes dear if you are tired said lydgate gently turning his eyes and resting them on her but not otherwise moving rosamond s presence at that moment was perhaps no more than a spoonful brought to the lake and her woman s instinct in this matter was not dull what is absorbing you she said leaning forward and bringing her face nearer to his he moved his hands and placed them gently behind her shoulders i am thinking of a great fellow who was about as old as i am three hundred years ago and had already begun a new era in anatomy i can t guess said rosamond shaking her head we used to play at guessing historical characters at mrs lemon s but not anatomists i ll tell you his name was vesalius and the only way he could get to know anatomy as he did was by going to snatch bodies at night from graveyards and places of execution oh said rosamond with a look of disgust on her pretty face i am very glad you are not vesalius i should have thought he might find some less horrible way than that no he couldn t said lydgate going on too earnestly to take much notice of her answer he could only get a complete skeleton by snatching the whitened bones of a criminal from the gallows and burying them and fetching them away by bits secretly in the dead of night i hope he is not one of your great heroes said rosamond half playfully half anxiously else i shall have you getting up in the night to go to st peter s churchyard you know how angry you told me the people were about mrs goby you have enemies enough already so had vesalius rosy no wonder the medical fogies in middlemarch are jealous when some of the greatest doctors living were fierce upon vesalius because they had believed in galen and he showed that galen was wrong they called him a liar and a poisonous monster but the facts of the human frame were on his side and so he got the better of them and what happened to him afterwards said rosamond with some interest oh he had a good deal of fighting to the last and they did exasperate him enough at one time to make him burn a good deal of his work then he got shipwrecked just as he was coming from jerusalem to take a great chair at padua he died rather miserably there was a moment s pause before rosamond said do you know tertius i often wish you had not been a medical man nay rosy don t say that said lydgate drawing her closer to him that is like saying you wish you had married another man not at all you are clever enough for anything you might easily have been something else and your cousins at quallingham all think that you have sunk below them in your choice of a profession the cousins at quallingham may go to the devil said lydgate with scorn it was like their impudence if they said anything of the sort to you still said rosamond i do not think it is a nice profession dear we know that she had much quiet perseverance in her opinion it is the grandest profession in the world rosamond said lydgate gravely and to say that you love me without loving the medical man in me is the same sort of thing as to say that you like eating a peach but don t like its flavor don t say that again dear it pains me very well doctor grave face said rosy dimpling i will declare in future that i dote on skeletons and body snatchers and bits of things in phials and quarrels with everybody that end in your dying miserably no no not so bad as that said lydgate giving up remonstrance and petting her resignedly while lydgate safely married and with the hospital under his command felt himself struggling for medical reform against middlemarch middlemarch was becoming more and more conscious of the national struggle for another kind of reform by the time that lord john russell s measure was being debated in the house of commons there was a new political animation in middlemarch and a new definition of parties which might show a decided change of balance if a new election came and there were some who already predicted this event declaring that a reform bill would never be carried by the actual parliament this was what will ladislaw dwelt on to mr brooke as a reason for congratulation that he had not yet tried his strength at the hustings things will grow and ripen as if it were a comet year said will the public temper will soon get to a cometary heat now the question of reform has set in there is likely to be another election before long and by that time middlemarch will have got more ideas into its head what we have to work at now is the pioneer and political meetings quite right ladislaw we shall make a new thing of opinion here said mr brooke only i want to keep myself independent about reform you know i don t want to go too far i want to take up wilberforce s and romilly s line you know and work at negro emancipation criminal law that kind of thing but of course i should support grey if you go in for the principle of reform you must be prepared to take what the situation offers said will if everybody pulled for his own bit against everybody else the whole question would go to tatters yes yes i agree with you i quite take that point of view i should put it in that light i should support grey you know but i don t want to change the balance of the constitution and i don t think grey would but that is what the country wants said will else there would be no meaning in political unions or any other movement that knows what it s about it wants to have a house of commons which is not weighted with nominees of the landed class but with representatives of the other interests and as to contending for a reform short of that it is like asking for a bit of an avalanche which has already begun to thunder that is fine ladislaw that is the way to put it write that down now we must begin to get documents about the feeling of the country as well as the machine breaking and general distress as to documents said will a two inch card will hold plenty a few rows of figures are enough to deduce misery from and a few more will show the rate at which the political determination of the people is growing good draw that out a little more at length ladislaw that is an idea now write it out in the pioneer put the figures and deduce the misery you know and put the other figures and deduce and so on you have a way of putting things burke now when i think of burke i can t help wishing somebody had a pocket borough to give you ladislaw you d never get elected you know and we shall always want talent in the house reform as we will we shall always want talent that avalanche and the thunder now was really a little like burke i want that sort of thing not ideas you know but a way of putting them pocket boroughs would be a fine thing said ladislaw if they were always in the right pocket and there were always a burke at hand will was not displeased with that complimentary comparison even from mr brooke for it is a little too trying to human flesh to be conscious of expressing one s self better than others and never to have it noticed and in the general dearth of admiration for the right thing even a chance bray of applause falling exactly in time is rather fortifying will felt that his literary refinements were usually beyond the limits of middlemarch perception nevertheless he was beginning thoroughly to like the work of which when he began he had said to himself rather languidly why not and he studied the political situation with as ardent an interest as he had ever given to poetic metres or mediaevalism it is undeniable that but for the desire to be where dorothea was and perhaps the want of knowing what else to do will would not at this time have been meditating on the needs of the english people or criticising english statesmanship he would probably have been rambling in italy sketching plans for several dramas trying prose and finding it too jejune trying verse and finding it too artificial beginning to copy bits from old pictures leaving off because they were no good and observing that after all self culture was the principal point while in politics he would have been sympathizing warmly with liberty and progress in general our sense of duty must often wait for some work which shall take the place of dilettanteism and make us feel that the quality of our action is not a matter of indifference ladislaw had now accepted his bit of work though it was not that indeterminate loftiest thing which he had once dreamed of as alone worthy of continuous effort his nature warmed easily in the presence of subjects which were visibly mixed with life and action and the easily stirred rebellion in him helped the glow of public spirit in spite of mr casaubon and the banishment from lowick he was rather happy getting a great deal of fresh knowledge in a vivid way and for practical purposes and making the pioneer celebrated as far as brassing never mind the smallness of the area the writing was not worse than much that reaches the four corners of the earth mr brooke was occasionally irritating but will s impatience was relieved by the division of his time between visits to the grange and retreats to his middlemarch lodgings which gave variety to his life shift the pegs a little he said to himself and mr brooke might be in the cabinet while i was under secretary that is the common order of things the little waves make the large ones and are of the same pattern i am better here than in the sort of life mr casaubon would have trained me for where the doing would be all laid down by a precedent too rigid for me to react upon i don t care for prestige or high pay as lydgate had said of him he was a sort of gypsy rather enjoying the sense of belonging to no class he had a feeling of romance in his position and a pleasant consciousness of creating a little surprise wherever he went that sort of enjoyment had been disturbed when he had felt some new distance between himself and dorothea in their accidental meeting at lydgate s and his irritation had gone out towards mr casaubon who had declared beforehand that will would lose caste i never had any caste he would have said if that prophecy had been uttered to him and the quick blood would have come and gone like breath in his transparent skin but it is one thing to like defiance and another thing to like its consequences meanwhile the town opinion about the new editor of the pioneer was tending to confirm mr casaubon s view will s relationship in that distinguished quarter did not like lydgate s high connections serve as an advantageous introduction if it was rumored that young ladislaw was mr casaubon s nephew or cousin it was also rumored that mr casaubon would have nothing to do with him brooke has taken him up said mr hawley because that is what no man in his senses could have expected casaubon has devilish good reasons you may be sure for turning the cold shoulder on a young fellow whose bringing up he paid for just like brooke one of those fellows who would praise a cat to sell a horse and some oddities of will s more or less poetical appeared to support mr keck the editor of the trumpet in asserting that ladislaw if the truth were known was not only a polish emissary but crack brained which accounted for the preternatural quickness and glibness of his speech when he got on to a platform as he did whenever he had an opportunity speaking with a facility which cast reflections on solid englishmen generally it was disgusting to keck to see a strip of a fellow with light curls round his head get up and speechify by the hour against institutions which had existed when he was in his cradle and in a leading article of the trumpet keck characterized ladislaw s speech at a reform meeting as the violence of an energumen a miserable effort to shroud in the brilliancy of fireworks the daring of irresponsible statements and the poverty of a knowledge which was of the cheapest and most recent description that was a rattling article yesterday keck said dr sprague with sarcastic intentions but what is an energumen oh a term that came up in the french revolution said keck this dangerous aspect of ladislaw was strangely contrasted with other habits which became matter of remark he had a fondness half artistic half affectionate for little children the smaller they were on tolerably active legs and the funnier their clothing the better will liked to surprise and please them we know that in rome he was given to ramble about among the poor people and the taste did not quit him in middlemarch he had somehow picked up a troop of droll children little hatless boys with their galligaskins much worn and scant shirting to hang out little girls who tossed their hair out of their eyes to look at him and guardian brothers at the mature age of seven this troop he had led out on gypsy excursions to halsell wood at nutting time and since the cold weather had set in he had taken them on a clear day to gather sticks for a bonfire in the hollow of a hillside where he drew out a small feast of gingerbread for them and improvised a punch and judy drama with some private home made puppets here was one oddity another was that in houses where he got friendly he was given to stretch himself at full length on the rug while he talked and was apt to be discovered in this attitude by occasional callers for whom such an irregularity was likely to confirm the notions of his dangerously mixed blood and general laxity but will s articles and speeches naturally recommended him in families which the new strictness of party division had marked off on the side of reform he was invited to mr bulstrode s but here he could not lie down on the rug and mrs bulstrode felt that his mode of talking about catholic countries as if there were any truce with antichrist illustrated the usual tendency to unsoundness in intellectual men at mr farebrother s however whom the irony of events had brought on the same side with bulstrode in the national movement will became a favorite with the ladies especially with little miss noble whom it was one of his oddities to escort when he met her in the street with her little basket giving her his arm in the eyes of the town and insisting on going with her to pay some call where she distributed her small filchings from her own share of sweet things but the house where he visited oftenest and lay most on the rug was lydgate s the two men were not at all alike but they agreed none the worse lydgate was abrupt but not irritable taking little notice of megrims in healthy people and ladislaw did not usually throw away his susceptibilities on those who took no notice of them with rosamond on the other hand he pouted and was wayward nay often uncomplimentary much to her inward surprise nevertheless he was gradually becoming necessary to her entertainment by his companionship in her music his varied talk and his freedom from the grave preoccupation which with all her husband s tenderness and indulgence often made his manners unsatisfactory to her and confirmed her dislike of the medical profession lydgate inclined to be sarcastic on the superstitious faith of the people in the efficacy of the bill while nobody cared about the low state of pathology sometimes assailed will with troublesome questions one evening in march rosamond in her cherry colored dress with swansdown trimming about the throat sat at the tea table lydgate lately come in tired from his outdoor work was seated sideways on an easy chair by the fire with one leg over the elbow his brow looking a little troubled as his eyes rambled over the columns of the pioneer while rosamond having noticed that he was perturbed avoided looking at him and inwardly thanked heaven that she herself had not a moody disposition will ladislaw was stretched on the rug contemplating the curtain pole abstractedly and humming very low the notes of when first i saw thy face while the house spaniel also stretched out with small choice of room looked from between his paws at the usurper of the rug with silent but strong objection rosamond bringing lydgate his cup of tea he threw down the paper and said to will who had started up and gone to the table it s no use your puffing brooke as a reforming landlord ladislaw they only pick the more holes in his coat in the trumpet no matter those who read the pioneer don t read the trumpet said will swallowing his tea and walking about do you suppose the public reads with a view to its own conversion we should have a witches brewing with a vengeance then mingle mingle mingle mingle you that mingle may and nobody would know which side he was going to take farebrother says he doesn t believe brooke would get elected if the opportunity came the very men who profess to be for him would bring another member out of the bag at the right moment there s no harm in trying it s good to have resident members why said lydgate who was much given to use that inconvenient word in a curt tone they represent the local stupidity better said will laughing and shaking his curls and they are kept on their best behavior in the neighborhood brooke is not a bad fellow but he has done some good things on his estate that he never would have done but for this parliamentary bite he s not fitted to be a public man said lydgate with contemptuous decision he would disappoint everybody who counted on him i can see that at the hospital only there bulstrode holds the reins and drives
