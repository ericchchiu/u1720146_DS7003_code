with those words uttered impetuously will rose put out his hand to rosamond still with the air of a somnambulist and went away when he was gone rosamond left her chair and walked to the other end of the room leaning when she got there against a chiffonniere and looking out of the window wearily she was oppressed by ennui and by that dissatisfaction which in women s minds is continually turning into a trivial jealousy referring to no real claims springing from no deeper passion than the vague exactingness of egoism and yet capable of impelling action as well as speech there really is nothing to care for much said poor rosamond inwardly thinking of the family at quallingham who did not write to her and that perhaps tertius when he came home would tease her about expenses she had already secretly disobeyed him by asking her father to help them and he had ended decisively by saying i am more likely to want help myself a few days afterwards it was already the end of august there was an occasion which caused some excitement in middlemarch the public if it chose was to have the advantage of buying under the distinguished auspices of mr borthrop trumbull the furniture books and pictures which anybody might see by the handbills to be the best in every kind belonging to edwin larcher esq this was not one of the sales indicating the depression of trade on the contrary it was due to mr larcher s great success in the carrying business which warranted his purchase of a mansion near riverston already furnished in high style by an illustrious spa physician furnished indeed with such large framefuls of expensive flesh painting in the dining room that mrs larcher was nervous until reassured by finding the subjects to be scriptural hence the fine opportunity to purchasers which was well pointed out in the handbills of mr borthrop trumbull whose acquaintance with the history of art enabled him to state that the hall furniture to be sold without reserve comprised a piece of carving by a contemporary of gibbons at middlemarch in those times a large sale was regarded as a kind of festival there was a table spread with the best cold eatables as at a superior funeral and facilities were offered for that generous drinking of cheerful glasses which might lead to generous and cheerful bidding for undesirable articles mr larcher s sale was the more attractive in the fine weather because the house stood just at the end of the town with a garden and stables attached in that pleasant issue from middlemarch called the london road which was also the road to the new hospital and to mr bulstrode s retired residence known as the shrubs in short the auction was as good as a fair and drew all classes with leisure at command to some who risked making bids in order simply to raise prices it was almost equal to betting at the races the second day when the best furniture was to be sold everybody was there even mr thesiger the rector of st peter s had looked in for a short time wishing to buy the carved table and had rubbed elbows with mr bambridge and mr horrock there was a wreath of middlemarch ladies accommodated with seats round the large table in the dining room where mr borthrop trumbull was mounted with desk and hammer but the rows chiefly of masculine faces behind were often varied by incomings and outgoings both from the door and the large bow window opening on to the lawn everybody that day did not include mr bulstrode whose health could not well endure crowds and draughts but mrs bulstrode had particularly wished to have a certain picture a supper at emmaus attributed in the catalogue to guido and at the last moment before the day of the sale mr bulstrode had called at the office of the pioneer of which he was now one of the proprietors to beg of mr ladislaw as a great favor that he would obligingly use his remarkable knowledge of pictures on behalf of mrs bulstrode and judge of the value of this particular painting if added the scrupulously polite banker attendance at the sale would not interfere with the arrangements for your departure which i know is imminent this proviso might have sounded rather satirically in will s ear if he had been in a mood to care about such satire it referred to an understanding entered into many weeks before with the proprietors of the paper that he should be at liberty any day he pleased to hand over the management to the subeditor whom he had been training since he wished finally to quit middlemarch but indefinite visions of ambition are weak against the ease of doing what is habitual or beguilingly agreeable and we all know the difficulty of carrying out a resolve when we secretly long that it may turn out to be unnecessary in such states of mind the most incredulous person has a private leaning towards miracle impossible to conceive how our wish could be fulfilled still very wonderful things have happened will did not confess this weakness to himself but he lingered what was the use of going to london at that time of the year the rugby men who would remember him were not there and so far as political writing was concerned he would rather for a few weeks go on with the pioneer at the present moment however when mr bulstrode was speaking to him he had both a strengthened resolve to go and an equally strong resolve not to go till he had once more seen dorothea hence he replied that he had reasons for deferring his departure a little and would be happy to go to the sale will was in a defiant mood his consciousness being deeply stung with the thought that the people who looked at him probably knew a fact tantamount to an accusation against him as a fellow with low designs which were to be frustrated by a disposal of property like most people who assert their freedom with regard to conventional distinction he was prepared to be sudden and quick at quarrel with any one who might hint that he had personal reasons for that assertion that there was anything in his blood his bearing or his character to which he gave the mask of an opinion when he was under an irritating impression of this kind he would go about for days with a defiant look the color changing in his transparent skin as if he were on the qui vive watching for something which he had to dart upon this expression was peculiarly noticeable in him at the sale and those who had only seen him in his moods of gentle oddity or of bright enjoyment would have been struck with a contrast he was not sorry to have this occasion for appearing in public before the middlemarch tribes of toller hackbutt and the rest who looked down on him as an adventurer and were in a state of brutal ignorance about dante who sneered at his polish blood and were themselves of a breed very much in need of crossing he stood in a conspicuous place not far from the auctioneer with a fore finger in each side pocket and his head thrown backward not caring to speak to anybody though he had been cordially welcomed as a connoiss ure by mr trumbull who was enjoying the utmost activity of his great faculties and surely among all men whose vocation requires them to exhibit their powers of speech the happiest is a prosperous provincial auctioneer keenly alive to his own jokes and sensible of his encyclopedic knowledge some saturnine sour blooded persons might object to be constantly insisting on the merits of all articles from boot jacks to berghems but mr borthrop trumbull had a kindly liquid in his veins he was an admirer by nature and would have liked to have the universe under his hammer feeling that it would go at a higher figure for his recommendation meanwhile mrs larcher s drawing room furniture was enough for him when will ladislaw had come in a second fender said to have been forgotten in its right place suddenly claimed the auctioneer s enthusiasm which he distributed on the equitable principle of praising those things most which were most in need of praise the fender was of polished steel with much lancet shaped open work and a sharp edge now ladies said he i shall appeal to you here is a fender which at any other sale would hardly be offered with out reserve being as i may say for quality of steel and quaintness of design a kind of thing here mr trumbull dropped his voice and became slightly nasal trimming his outlines with his left finger that might not fall in with ordinary tastes allow me to tell you that by and by this style of workmanship will be the only one in vogue half a crown you said thank you going at half a crown this characteristic fender and i have particular information that the antique style is very much sought after in high quarters three shillings three and sixpence hold it well up joseph look ladies at the chastity of the design i have no doubt myself that it was turned out in the last century four shillings mr mawmsey four shillings it s not a thing i would put in my drawing room said mrs mawmsey audibly for the warning of the rash husband i wonder at mrs larcher every blessed child s head that fell against it would be cut in two the edge is like a knife quite true rejoined mr trumbull quickly and most uncommonly useful to have a fender at hand that will cut if you have a leather shoe tie or a bit of string that wants cutting and no knife at hand many a man has been left hanging because there was no knife to cut him down gentlemen here s a fender that if you had the misfortune to hang yourselves would cut you down in no time with astonishing celerity four and sixpence five five and sixpence an appropriate thing for a spare bedroom where there was a four poster and a guest a little out of his mind six shillings thank you mr clintup going at six shillings going gone the auctioneer s glance which had been searching round him with a preternatural susceptibility to all signs of bidding here dropped on the paper before him and his voice too dropped into a tone of indifferent despatch as he said mr clintup be handy joseph it was worth six shillings to have a fender you could always tell that joke on said mr clintup laughing low and apologetically to his next neighbor he was a diffident though distinguished nurseryman and feared that the audience might regard his bid as a foolish one meanwhile joseph had brought a trayful of small articles now ladies said mr trumbull taking up one of the articles this tray contains a very recherchy lot a collection of trifles for the drawing room table and trifles make the sum of human things nothing more important than trifles yes mr ladislaw yes by and by but pass the tray round joseph these bijoux must be examined ladies this i have in my hand is an ingenious contrivance a sort of practical rebus i may call it here you see it looks like an elegant heart shaped box portable for the pocket there again it becomes like a splendid double flower an ornament for the table and now mr trumbull allowed the flower to fall alarmingly into strings of heart shaped leaves a book of riddles no less than five hundred printed in a beautiful red gentlemen if i had less of a conscience i should not wish you to bid high for this lot i have a longing for it myself what can promote innocent mirth and i may say virtue more than a good riddle it hinders profane language and attaches a man to the society of refined females this ingenious article itself without the elegant domino box card basket c ought alone to give a high price to the lot carried in the pocket it might make an individual welcome in any society four shillings sir four shillings for this remarkable collection of riddles with the et caeteras here is a sample how must you spell honey to make it catch lady birds answer money you hear lady birds honey money this is an amusement to sharpen the intellect it has a sting it has what we call satire and wit without indecency four and sixpence five shillings the bidding ran on with warming rivalry mr bowyer was a bidder and this was too exasperating bowyer couldn t afford it and only wanted to hinder every other man from making a figure the current carried even mr horrock with it but this committal of himself to an opinion fell from him with so little sacrifice of his neutral expression that the bid might not have been detected as his but for the friendly oaths of mr bambridge who wanted to know what horrock would do with blasted stuff only fit for haberdashers given over to that state of perdition which the horse dealer so cordially recognized in the majority of earthly existences the lot was finally knocked down at a guinea to mr spilkins a young slender of the neighborhood who was reckless with his pocket money and felt his want of memory for riddles come trumbull this is too bad you ve been putting some old maid s rubbish into the sale murmured mr toller getting close to the auctioneer i want to see how the prints go and i must be off soon im mediately mr toller it was only an act of benevolence which your noble heart would approve joseph quick with the prints lot 235 now gentlemen you who are connoiss ures you are going to have a treat here is an engraving of the duke of wellington surrounded by his staff on the field of waterloo and notwithstanding recent events which have as it were enveloped our great hero in a cloud i will be bold to say for a man in my line must not be blown about by political winds that a finer subject of the modern order belonging to our own time and epoch the understanding of man could hardly conceive angels might perhaps but not men sirs not men who painted it said mr powderell much impressed it is a proof before the letter mr powderell the painter is not known answered trumbull with a certain gaspingness in his last words after which he pursed up his lips and stared round him i ll bid a pound said mr powderell in a tone of resolved emotion as of a man ready to put himself in the breach whether from awe or pity nobody raised the price on him next came two dutch prints which mr toller had been eager for and after he had secured them he went away other prints and afterwards some paintings were sold to leading middlemarchers who had come with a special desire for them and there was a more active movement of the audience in and out some who had bought what they wanted going away others coming in either quite newly or from a temporary visit to the refreshments which were spread under the marquee on the lawn it was this marquee that mr bambridge was bent on buying and he appeared to like looking inside it frequently as a foretaste of its possession on the last occasion of his return from it he was observed to bring with him a new companion a stranger to mr trumbull and every one else whose appearance however led to the supposition that he might be a relative of the horse dealer s also given to indulgence his large whiskers imposing swagger and swing of the leg made him a striking figure but his suit of black rather shabby at the edges caused the prejudicial inference that he was not able to afford himself as much indulgence as he liked who is it you ve picked up bam said mr horrock aside ask him yourself returned mr bambridge he said he d just turned in from the road mr horrock eyed the stranger who was leaning back against his stick with one hand using his toothpick with the other and looking about him with a certain restlessness apparently under the silence imposed on him by circumstances at length the supper at emmaus was brought forward to will s immense relief for he was getting so tired of the proceedings that he had drawn back a little and leaned his shoulder against the wall just behind the auctioneer he now came forward again and his eye caught the conspicuous stranger who rather to his surprise was staring at him markedly but will was immediately appealed to by mr trumbull yes mr ladislaw yes this interests you as a connoiss ure i think it is some pleasure the auctioneer went on with a rising fervor to have a picture like this to show to a company of ladies and gentlemen a picture worth any sum to an individual whose means were on a level with his judgment it is a painting of the italian school by the celebrated guydo the greatest painter in the world the chief of the old masters as they are called i take it because they were up to a thing or two beyond most of us in possession of secrets now lost to the bulk of mankind let me tell you gentlemen i have seen a great many pictures by the old masters and they are not all up to this mark some of them are darker than you might like and not family subjects but here is a guydo the frame alone is worth pounds which any lady might be proud to hang up a suitable thing for what we call a refectory in a charitable institution if any gentleman of the corporation wished to show his munifi cence turn it a little sir yes joseph turn it a little towards mr ladislaw mr ladislaw having been abroad understands the merit of these things you observe all eyes were for a moment turned towards will who said coolly five pounds the auctioneer burst out in deep remonstrance ah mr ladislaw the frame alone is worth that ladies and gentlemen for the credit of the town suppose it should be discovered hereafter that a gem of art has been amongst us in this town and nobody in middlemarch awake to it five guineas five seven six five ten still ladies still it is a gem and full many a gem as the poet says has been allowed to go at a nominal price because the public knew no better because it was offered in circles where there was i was going to say a low feeling but no six pounds six guineas a guydo of the first order going at six guineas it is an insult to religion ladies it touches us all as christians gentlemen that a subject like this should go at such a low figure six pounds ten seven the bidding was brisk and will continued to share in it remembering that mrs bulstrode had a strong wish for the picture and thinking that he might stretch the price to twelve pounds but it was knocked down to him at ten guineas whereupon he pushed his way towards the bow window and went out he chose to go under the marquee to get a glass of water being hot and thirsty it was empty of other visitors and he asked the woman in attendance to fetch him some fresh water but before she was well gone he was annoyed to see entering the florid stranger who had stared at him it struck will at this moment that the man might be one of those political parasitic insects of the bloated kind who had once or twice claimed acquaintance with him as having heard him speak on the reform question and who might think of getting a shilling by news in this light his person already rather heating to behold on a summer s day appeared the more disagreeable and will half seated on the elbow of a garden chair turned his eyes carefully away from the comer but this signified little to our acquaintance mr raffles who never hesitated to thrust himself on unwilling observation if it suited his purpose to do so he moved a step or two till he was in front of will and said with full mouthed haste excuse me mr ladislaw was your mother s name sarah dunkirk will starting to his feet moved backward a step frowning and saying with some fierceness yes sir it was and what is that to you it was in will s nature that the first spark it threw out was a direct answer of the question and a challenge of the consequences to have said what is that to you in the first instance would have seemed like shuffling as if he minded who knew anything about his origin raffles on his side had not the same eagerness for a collision which was implied in ladislaw s threatening air the slim young fellow with his girl s complexion looked like a tiger cat ready to spring on him under such circumstances mr raffles s pleasure in annoying his company was kept in abeyance no offence my good sir no offence i only remember your mother knew her when she was a girl but it is your father that you feature sir i had the pleasure of seeing your father too parents alive mr ladislaw no thundered will in the same attitude as before should be glad to do you a service mr ladislaw by jove i should hope to meet again hereupon raffles who had lifted his hat with the last words turned himself round with a swing of his leg and walked away will looked after him a moment and could see that he did not re enter the auction room but appeared to be walking towards the road for an instant he thought that he had been foolish not to let the man go on talking but no on the whole he preferred doing without knowledge from that source later in the evening however raffles overtook him in the street and appearing either to have forgotten the roughness of his former reception or to intend avenging it by a forgiving familiarity greeted him jovially and walked by his side remarking at first on the pleasantness of the town and neighborhood will suspected that the man had been drinking and was considering how to shake him off when raffles said i ve been abroad myself mr ladislaw i ve seen the world used to parley vous a little it was at boulogne i saw your father a most uncommon likeness you are of him by jove mouth nose eyes hair turned off your brow just like his a little in the foreign style john bull doesn t do much of that but your father was very ill when i saw him lord lord hands you might see through you were a small youngster then did he get well no said will curtly ah well i ve often wondered what became of your mother she ran away from her friends when she was a young lass a proud spirited lass and pretty by jove i knew the reason why she ran away said raffles winking slowly as he looked sideways at will you know nothing dishonorable of her sir said will turning on him rather savagely but mr raffles just now was not sensitive to shades of manner not a bit said he tossing his head decisively she was a little too honorable to like her friends that was it here raffles again winked slowly lord bless you i knew all about em a little in what you may call the respectable thieving line the high style of receiving house none of your holes and corners first rate slap up shop high profits and no mistake but lord sarah would have known nothing about it a dashing young lady she was fine boarding school fit for a lord s wife only archie duncan threw it at her out of spite because she would have nothing to do with him and so she ran away from the whole concern i travelled for em sir in a gentlemanly way at a high salary they didn t mind her running away at first godly folks sir very godly and she was for the stage the son was alive then and the daughter was at a discount hallo here we are at the blue bull what do you say mr ladislaw shall we turn in and have a glass no i must say good evening said will dashing up a passage which led into lowick gate and almost running to get out of raffles s reach he walked a long while on the lowick road away from the town glad of the starlit darkness when it came he felt as if he had had dirt cast on him amidst shouts of scorn there was this to confirm the fellow s statement that his mother never would tell him the reason why she had run away from her family well what was he will ladislaw the worse supposing the truth about that family to be the ugliest his mother had braved hardship in order to separate herself from it but if dorothea s friends had known this story if the chettams had known it they would have had a fine color to give their suspicions a welcome ground for thinking him unfit to come near her however let them suspect what they pleased they would find themselves in the wrong they would find out that the blood in his veins was as free from the taint of meanness as theirs the same night when mr bulstrode returned from a journey to brassing on business his good wife met him in the entrance hall and drew him into his private sitting room nicholas she said fixing her honest eyes upon him anxiously there has been such a disagreeable man here asking for you it has made me quite uncomfortable what kind of man my dear said mr bulstrode dreadfully certain of the answer a red faced man with large whiskers and most impudent in his manner he declared he was an old friend of yours and said you would be sorry not to see him he wanted to wait for you here but i told him he could see you at the bank to morrow morning most impudent he was stared at me and said his friend nick had luck in wives i don t believe he would have gone away if blucher had not happened to break his chain and come running round on the gravel for i was in the garden so i said you d better go away the dog is very fierce and i can t hold him do you really know anything of such a man i believe i know who he is my dear said mr bulstrode in his usual subdued voice an unfortunate dissolute wretch whom i helped too much in days gone by however i presume you will not be troubled by him again he will probably come to the bank to beg doubtless no more was said on the subject until the next day when mr bulstrode had returned from the town and was dressing for dinner his wife not sure that he was come home looked into his dressing room and saw him with his coat and cravat off leaning one arm on a chest of drawers and staring absently at the ground he started nervously and looked up as she entered you look very ill nicholas is there anything the matter i have a good deal of pain in my head said mr bulstrode who was so frequently ailing that his wife was always ready to believe in this cause of depression sit down and let me sponge it with vinegar physically mr bulstrode did not want the vinegar but morally the affectionate attention soothed him though always polite it was his habit to receive such services with marital coolness as his wife s duty but to day while she was bending over him he said you are very good harriet in a tone which had something new in it to her ear she did not know exactly what the novelty was but her woman s solicitude shaped itself into a darting thought that he might be going to have an illness has anything worried you she said did that man come to you at the bank yes it was as i had supposed he is a man who at one time might have done better but he has sunk into a drunken debauched creature is he quite gone away said mrs bulstrode anxiously but for certain reasons she refrained from adding it was very disagreeable to hear him calling himself a friend of yours at that moment she would not have liked to say anything which implied her habitual consciousness that her husband s earlier connections were not quite on a level with her own not that she knew much about them that her husband had at first been employed in a bank that he had afterwards entered into what he called city business and gained a fortune before he was three and thirty that he had married a widow who was much older than himself a dissenter and in other ways probably of that disadvantageous quality usually perceptible in a first wife if inquired into with the dispassionate judgment of a second was almost as much as she had cared to learn beyond the glimpses which mr bulstrode s narrative occasionally gave of his early bent towards religion his inclination to be a preacher and his association with missionary and philanthropic efforts she believed in him as an excellent man whose piety carried a peculiar eminence in belonging to a layman whose influence had turned her own mind toward seriousness and whose share of perishable good had been the means of raising her own position but she also liked to think that it was well in every sense for mr bulstrode to have won the hand of harriet vincy whose family was undeniable in a middlemarch light a better light surely than any thrown in london thoroughfares or dissenting chapel yards the unreformed provincial mind distrusted london and while true religion was everywhere saving honest mrs bulstrode was convinced that to be saved in the church was more respectable she so much wished to ignore towards others that her husband had ever been a london dissenter that she liked to keep it out of sight even in talking to him he was quite aware of this indeed in some respects he was rather afraid of this ingenuous wife whose imitative piety and native worldliness were equally sincere who had nothing to be ashamed of and whom he had married out of a thorough inclination still subsisting but his fears were such as belong to a man who cares to maintain his recognized supremacy the loss of high consideration from his wife as from every one else who did not clearly hate him out of enmity to the truth would be as the beginning of death to him when she said is he quite gone away oh i trust so he answered with an effort to throw as much sober unconcern into his tone as possible but in truth mr bulstrode was very far from a state of quiet trust in the interview at the bank raffles had made it evident that his eagerness to torment was almost as strong in him as any other greed he had frankly said that he had turned out of the way to come to middlemarch just to look about him and see whether the neighborhood would suit him to live in he had certainly had a few debts to pay more than he expected but the two hundred pounds were not gone yet a cool five and twenty would suffice him to go away with for the present what he had wanted chiefly was to see his friend nick and family and know all about the prosperity of a man to whom he was so much attached by and by he might come back for a longer stay this time raffles declined to be seen off the premises as he expressed it declined to quit middlemarch under bulstrode s eyes he meant to go by coach the next day if he chose bulstrode felt himself helpless neither threats nor coaxing could avail he could not count on any persistent fear nor on any promise on the contrary he felt a cold certainty at his heart that raffles unless
