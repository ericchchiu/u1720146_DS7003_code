it came shortly before the memorable meeting at the town hall and was nothing less than a letter from will ladislaw to lydgate which turned indeed chiefly on his new interest in plans of colonization but mentioned incidentally that he might find it necessary to pay a visit to middlemarch within the next few weeks a very pleasant necessity he said almost as good as holidays to a schoolboy he hoped there was his old place on the rug and a great deal of music in store for him but he was quite uncertain as to the time while lydgate was reading the letter to rosamond her face looked like a reviving flower it grew prettier and more blooming there was nothing unendurable now the debts were paid mr ladislaw was coming and lydgate would be persuaded to leave middlemarch and settle in london which was so different from a provincial town that was a bright bit of morning but soon the sky became black over poor rosamond the presence of a new gloom in her husband about which he was entirely reserved towards her for he dreaded to expose his lacerated feeling to her neutrality and misconception soon received a painfully strange explanation alien to all her previous notions of what could affect her happiness in the new gayety of her spirits thinking that lydgate had merely a worse fit of moodiness than usual causing him to leave her remarks unanswered and evidently to keep out of her way as much as possible she chose a few days after the meeting and without speaking to him on the subject to send out notes of invitation for a small evening party feeling convinced that this was a judicious step since people seemed to have been keeping aloof from them and wanted restoring to the old habit of intercourse when the invitations had been accepted she would tell lydgate and give him a wise admonition as to how a medical man should behave to his neighbors for rosamond had the gravest little airs possible about other people s duties but all the invitations were declined and the last answer came into lydgate s hands this is chichely s scratch what is he writing to you about said lydgate wonderingly as he handed the note to her she was obliged to let him see it and looking at her severely he said why on earth have you been sending out invitations without telling me rosamond i beg i insist that you will not invite any one to this house i suppose you have been inviting others and they have refused too she said nothing do you hear me thundered lydgate yes certainly i hear you said rosamond turning her head aside with the movement of a graceful long necked bird lydgate tossed his head without any grace and walked out of the room feeling himself dangerous rosamond s thought was that he was getting more and more unbearable not that there was any new special reason for this peremptoriness his indisposition to tell her anything in which he was sure beforehand that she would not be interested was growing into an unreflecting habit and she was in ignorance of everything connected with the thousand pounds except that the loan had come from her uncle bulstrode lydgate s odious humors and their neighbors apparent avoidance of them had an unaccountable date for her in their relief from money difficulties if the invitations had been accepted she would have gone to invite her mamma and the rest whom she had seen nothing of for several days and she now put on her bonnet to go and inquire what had become of them all suddenly feeling as if there were a conspiracy to leave her in isolation with a husband disposed to offend everybody it was after the dinner hour and she found her father and mother seated together alone in the drawing room they greeted her with sad looks saying well my dear and no more she had never seen her father look so downcast and seating herself near him she said is there anything the matter papa he did not answer but mrs vincy said oh my dear have you heard nothing it won t be long before it reaches you is it anything about tertius said rosamond turning pale the idea of trouble immediately connected itself with what had been unaccountable to her in him oh my dear yes to think of your marrying into this trouble debt was bad enough but this will be worse stay stay lucy said mr vincy have you heard nothing about your uncle bulstrode rosamond no papa said the poor thing feeling as if trouble were not anything she had before experienced but some invisible power with an iron grasp that made her soul faint within her her father told her everything saying at the end it s better for you to know my dear i think lydgate must leave the town things have gone against him i dare say he couldn t help it i don t accuse him of any harm said mr vincy he had always before been disposed to find the utmost fault with lydgate the shock to rosamond was terrible it seemed to her that no lot could be so cruelly hard as hers to have married a man who had become the centre of infamous suspicions in many cases it is inevitable that the shame is felt to be the worst part of crime and it would have required a great deal of disentangling reflection such as had never entered into rosamond s life for her in these moments to feel that her trouble was less than if her husband had been certainly known to have done something criminal all the shame seemed to be there and she had innocently married this man with the belief that he and his family were a glory to her she showed her usual reticence to her parents and only said that if lydgate had done as she wished he would have left middlemarch long ago she bears it beyond anything said her mother when she was gone ah thank god said mr vincy who was much broken down but rosamond went home with a sense of justified repugnance towards her husband what had he really done how had he really acted she did not know why had he not told her everything he did not speak to her on the subject and of course she could not speak to him it came into her mind once that she would ask her father to let her go home again but dwelling on that prospect made it seem utter dreariness to her a married woman gone back to live with her parents life seemed to have no meaning for her in such a position she could not contemplate herself in it the next two days lydgate observed a change in her and believed that she had heard the bad news would she speak to him about it or would she go on forever in the silence which seemed to imply that she believed him guilty we must remember that he was in a morbid state of mind in which almost all contact was pain certainly rosamond in this case had equal reason to complain of reserve and want of confidence on his part but in the bitterness of his soul he excused himself was he not justified in shrinking from the task of telling her since now she knew the truth she had no impulse to speak to him but a deeper lying consciousness that he was in fault made him restless and the silence between them became intolerable to him it was as if they were both adrift on one piece of wreck and looked away from each other he thought i am a fool haven t i given up expecting anything i have married care not help and that evening he said rosamond have you heard anything that distresses you yes she answered laying down her work which she had been carrying on with a languid semi consciousness most unlike her usual self what have you heard everything i suppose papa told me that people think me disgraced yes said rosamond faintly beginning to sew again automatically there was silence lydgate thought if she has any trust in me any notion of what i am she ought to speak now and say that she does not believe i have deserved disgrace but rosamond on her side went on moving her fingers languidly whatever was to be said on the subject she expected to come from tertius what did she know and if he were innocent of any wrong why did he not do something to clear himself this silence of hers brought a new rush of gall to that bitter mood in which lydgate had been saying to himself that nobody believed in him even farebrother had not come forward he had begun to question her with the intent that their conversation should disperse the chill fog which had gathered between them but he felt his resolution checked by despairing resentment even this trouble like the rest she seemed to regard as if it were hers alone he was always to her a being apart doing what she objected to he started from his chair with an angry impulse and thrusting his hands in his pockets walked up and down the room there was an underlying consciousness all the while that he should have to master this anger and tell her everything and convince her of the facts for he had almost learned the lesson that he must bend himself to her nature and that because she came short in her sympathy he must give the more soon he recurred to his intention of opening himself the occasion must not be lost if he could bring her to feel with some solemnity that here was a slander which must be met and not run away from and that the whole trouble had come out of his desperate want of money it would be a moment for urging powerfully on her that they should be one in the resolve to do with as little money as possible so that they might weather the bad time and keep themselves independent he would mention the definite measures which he desired to take and win her to a willing spirit he was bound to try this and what else was there for him to do he did not know how long he had been walking uneasily backwards and forwards but rosamond felt that it was long and wished that he would sit down she too had begun to think this an opportunity for urging on tertius what he ought to do whatever might be the truth about all this misery there was one dread which asserted itself lydgate at last seated himself not in his usual chair but in one nearer to rosamond leaning aside in it towards her and looking at her gravely before he reopened the sad subject he had conquered himself so far and was about to speak with a sense of solemnity as on an occasion which was not to be repeated he had even opened his lips when rosamond letting her hands fall looked at him and said surely tertius well surely now at last you have given up the idea of staying in middlemarch i cannot go on living here let us go to london papa and every one else says you had better go whatever misery i have to put up with it will be easier away from here lydgate felt miserably jarred instead of that critical outpouring for which he had prepared himself with effort here was the old round to be gone through again he could not bear it with a quick change of countenance he rose and went out of the room perhaps if he had been strong enough to persist in his determination to be the more because she was less that evening might have had a better issue if his energy could have borne down that check he might still have wrought on rosamond s vision and will we cannot be sure that any natures however inflexible or peculiar will resist this effect from a more massive being than their own they may be taken by storm and for the moment converted becoming part of the soul which enwraps them in the ardor of its movement but poor lydgate had a throbbing pain within him and his energy had fallen short of its task the beginning of mutual understanding and resolve seemed as far off as ever nay it seemed blocked out by the sense of unsuccessful effort they lived on from day to day with their thoughts still apart lydgate going about what work he had in a mood of despair and rosamond feeling with some justification that he was behaving cruelly it was of no use to say anything to tertius but when will ladislaw came she was determined to tell him everything in spite of her general reticence she needed some one who would recognize her wrongs some days later lydgate was riding to lowick manor in consequence of a summons from dorothea the summons had not been unexpected since it had followed a letter from mr bulstrode in which he stated that he had resumed his arrangements for quitting middlemarch and must remind lydgate of his previous communications about the hospital to the purport of which he still adhered it had been his duty before taking further steps to reopen the subject with mrs casaubon who now wished as before to discuss the question with lydgate your views may possibly have undergone some change wrote mr bulstrode but in that case also it is desirable that you should lay them before her dorothea awaited his arrival with eager interest though in deference to her masculine advisers she had refrained from what sir james had called interfering in this bulstrode business the hardship of lydgate s position was continually in her mind and when bulstrode applied to her again about the hospital she felt that the opportunity was come to her which she had been hindered from hastening in her luxurious home wandering under the boughs of her own great trees her thought was going out over the lot of others and her emotions were imprisoned the idea of some active good within her reach haunted her like a passion and another s need having once come to her as a distinct image preoccupied her desire with the yearning to give relief and made her own ease tasteless she was full of confident hope about this interview with lydgate never heeding what was said of his personal reserve never heeding that she was a very young woman nothing could have seemed more irrelevant to dorothea than insistence on her youth and sex when she was moved to show her human fellowship as she sat waiting in the library she could do nothing but live through again all the past scenes which had brought lydgate into her memories they all owed their significance to her marriage and its troubles but no there were two occasions in which the image of lydgate had come painfully in connection with his wife and some one else the pain had been allayed for dorothea but it had left in her an awakened conjecture as to what lydgate s marriage might be to him a susceptibility to the slightest hint about mrs lydgate these thoughts were like a drama to her and made her eyes bright and gave an attitude of suspense to her whole frame though she was only looking out from the brown library on to the turf and the bright green buds which stood in relief against the dark evergreens when lydgate came in she was almost shocked at the change in his face which was strikingly perceptible to her who had not seen him for two months it was not the change of emaciation but that effect which even young faces will very soon show from the persistent presence of resentment and despondency her cordial look when she put out her hand to him softened his expression but only with melancholy i have wished very much to see you for a long while mr lydgate said dorothea when they were seated opposite each other but i put off asking you to come until mr bulstrode applied to me again about the hospital i know that the advantage of keeping the management of it separate from that of the infirmary depends on you or at least on the good which you are encouraged to hope for from having it under your control and i am sure you will not refuse to tell me exactly what you think you want to decide whether you should give a generous support to the hospital said lydgate i cannot conscientiously advise you to do it in dependence on any activity of mine i may be obliged to leave the town he spoke curtly feeling the ache of despair as to his being able to carry out any purpose that rosamond had set her mind against not because there is no one to believe in you said dorothea pouring out her words in clearness from a full heart i know the unhappy mistakes about you i knew them from the first moment to be mistakes you have never done anything vile you would not do anything dishonorable it was the first assurance of belief in him that had fallen on lydgate s ears he drew a deep breath and said thank you he could say no more it was something very new and strange in his life that these few words of trust from a woman should be so much to him i beseech you to tell me how everything was said dorothea fearlessly i am sure that the truth would clear you lydgate started up from his chair and went towards the window forgetting where he was he had so often gone over in his mind the possibility of explaining everything without aggravating appearances that would tell perhaps unfairly against bulstrode and had so often decided against it he had so often said to himself that his assertions would not change people s impressions that dorothea s words sounded like a temptation to do something which in his soberness he had pronounced to be unreasonable tell me pray said dorothea with simple earnestness then we can consult together it is wicked to let people think evil of any one falsely when it can be hindered lydgate turned remembering where he was and saw dorothea s face looking up at him with a sweet trustful gravity the presence of a noble nature generous in its wishes ardent in its charity changes the lights for us we begin to see things again in their larger quieter masses and to believe that we too can be seen and judged in the wholeness of our character that influence was beginning to act on lydgate who had for many days been seeing all life as one who is dragged and struggling amid the throng he sat down again and felt that he was recovering his old self in the consciousness that he was with one who believed in it i don t want he said to bear hard on bulstrode who has lent me money of which i was in need though i would rather have gone without it now he is hunted down and miserable and has only a poor thread of life in him but i should like to tell you everything it will be a comfort to me to speak where belief has gone beforehand and where i shall not seem to be offering assertions of my own honesty you will feel what is fair to another as you feel what is fair to me do trust me said dorothea i will not repeat anything without your leave but at the very least i could say that you have made all the circumstances clear to me and that i know you are not in any way guilty mr farebrother would believe me and my uncle and sir james chettam nay there are persons in middlemarch to whom i could go although they don t know much of me they would believe me they would know that i could have no other motive than truth and justice i would take any pains to clear you i have very little to do there is nothing better that i can do in the world dorothea s voice as she made this childlike picture of what she would do might have been almost taken as a proof that she could do it effectively the searching tenderness of her woman s tones seemed made for a defence against ready accusers lydgate did not stay to think that she was quixotic he gave himself up for the first time in his life to the exquisite sense of leaning entirely on a generous sympathy without any check of proud reserve and he told her everything from the time when under the pressure of his difficulties he unwillingly made his first application to bulstrode gradually in the relief of speaking getting into a more thorough utterance of what had gone on in his mind entering fully into the fact that his treatment of the patient was opposed to the dominant practice into his doubts at the last his ideal of medical duty and his uneasy consciousness that the acceptance of the money had made some difference in his private inclination and professional behavior though not in his fulfilment of any publicly recognized obligation it has come to my knowledge since he added that hawley sent some one to examine the housekeeper at stone court and she said that she gave the patient all the opium in the phial i left as well as a good deal of brandy but that would not have been opposed to ordinary prescriptions even of first rate men the suspicions against me had no hold there they are grounded on the knowledge that i took money that bulstrode had strong motives for wishing the man to die and that he gave me the money as a bribe to concur in some malpractices or other against the patient that in any case i accepted a bribe to hold my tongue they are just the suspicions that cling the most obstinately because they lie in people s inclination and can never be disproved how my orders came to be disobeyed is a question to which i don t know the answer it is still possible that bulstrode was innocent of any criminal intention even possible that he had nothing to do with the disobedience and merely abstained from mentioning it but all that has nothing to do with the public belief it is one of those cases on which a man is condemned on the ground of his character it is believed that he has committed a crime in some undefined way because he had the motive for doing it and bulstrode s character has enveloped me because i took his money i am simply blighted like a damaged ear of corn the business is done and can t be undone oh it is hard said dorothea i understand the difficulty there is in your vindicating yourself and that all this should have come to you who had meant to lead a higher life than the common and to find out better ways i cannot bear to rest in this as unchangeable i know you meant that i remember what you said to me when you first spoke to me about the hospital there is no sorrow i have thought more about than that to love what is great and try to reach it and yet to fail yes said lydgate feeling that here he had found room for the full meaning of his grief i had some ambition i meant everything to be different with me i thought i had more strength and mastery but the most terrible obstacles are such as nobody can see except oneself suppose said dorothea meditatively suppose we kept on the hospital according to the present plan and you stayed here though only with the friendship and support of a few the evil feeling towards you would gradually die out there would come opportunities in which people would be forced to acknowledge that they had been unjust to you because they would see that your purposes were pure you may still win a great fame like the louis and laennec i have heard you speak of and we shall all be proud of you she ended with a smile that might do if i had my old trust in myself said lydgate mournfully nothing galls me more than the notion of turning round and running away before this slander leaving it unchecked behind me still i can t ask any one to put a great deal of money into a plan which depends on me it would be quite worth my while said dorothea simply only think i am very uncomfortable with my money because they tell me i have too little for any great scheme of the sort i like best and yet i have too much i don t know what to do i have seven hundred a year of my own fortune and nineteen hundred a year that mr casaubon left me and between three and four thousand of ready money in the bank i wished to raise money and pay it off gradually out of my income which i don t want to buy land with and found a village which should be a school of industry but sir james and my uncle have convinced me that the risk would be too great so you see that what i should most rejoice at would be to have something good to do with my money i should like it to make other people s lives better to them it makes me very uneasy coming all to me who don t want it a smile broke through the gloom of lydgate s face the childlike grave eyed earnestness with which dorothea said all this was irresistible blent into an adorable whole with her ready understanding of high experience of lower experience such as plays a great part in the world poor mrs casaubon had a very blurred shortsighted knowledge little helped by her imagination but she took the smile as encouragement of her plan i think you see now that you spoke too scrupulously she said in a tone of persuasion the hospital would be one good and making your life quite whole and well again would be another lydgate s smile had died away you have the goodness as well as the money to do all that if it could be done he said but he hesitated a little while looking vaguely towards the window and she sat in silent expectation at last he turned towards her and said impetuously why should i not tell you you know what sort of bond marriage is you will understand everything dorothea felt her heart beginning to beat faster had he that sorrow too but she feared to say any word and he went on immediately it is impossible for me now to do anything to take any step without considering my wife s happiness the thing that i might like to do if i were alone is become impossible to me i can t see her miserable she married me without knowing what she was going into and it might have been better for her if she had not married me i know i know you could not give her pain if you were not obliged to do it said dorothea with keen memory of her own life and she has set her mind against staying she wishes to go the troubles she has had here have wearied her said lydgate breaking off again lest he should say too much but when she saw the good that might come of staying said dorothea remonstrantly looking at lydgate as if he had forgotten the reasons which had just been considered he did not speak immediately she would not see it he said at last curtly feeling at first that this statement must do without explanation and indeed i have lost all spirit about carrying on my life here he paused a moment and then following the impulse to let dorothea see deeper into the difficulty of his life he said the fact is this trouble has come upon her confusedly we have not been able to speak to each other about it i am not sure what is in her mind about it she may fear that i have really done something base it is my fault i ought to be more open but i have been suffering cruelly may i go and see her said dorothea eagerly would she accept my sympathy i would tell her that you have not been blamable before any one s judgment but your own i would tell her that you shall be cleared in every fair mind i would cheer her heart will you ask her if i may go to see her i did see her once i am sure you may said lydgate seizing the proposition with some hope she would feel honored cheered i think by the proof that you at least have some respect for me i will not speak to her about your coming that she may not connect it with my wishes at all i know very well that i ought not to have left anything to be told her by others but he broke off and there was a moment s silence dorothea refrained from saying what was in her mind how well she knew that there might be invisible barriers to speech between husband and wife this was a point on which even sympathy might make a wound she returned to the more outward aspect of lydgate s position saying cheerfully and if mrs lydgate knew that there were friends who would believe in you and support you she might then be glad that you should stay in your place and recover your hopes and do what you meant to do perhaps then you would see that it was right to agree with what i proposed about your continuing at the hospital surely you would if you still have faith in it as a means of making your knowledge useful lydgate did not answer and she saw that he was debating with himself you need not decide immediately she said gently a few days hence it will be early enough for me to send my answer to mr bulstrode lydgate still waited but at last turned to speak in his most decisive tones no i prefer that there should be no interval left for wavering i am no longer sure enough of myself i mean of what it would be possible for me to do under the changed circumstances of my life it would be dishonorable to let others engage themselves to anything serious in dependence on me i might be obliged to go away after all i see little chance of anything else the whole thing is too problematic i cannot consent to be the cause of your goodness being wasted no let the new hospital be joined with the old infirmary and everything go on as it might have done if i had never come i have kept a valuable register since i have been there i shall send it to a man who will make use of it he ended bitterly i can think of nothing for a long while but getting an income it hurts me very much to hear you speak so hopelessly said dorothea it would be a happiness to your friends who believe in your future in your power to do great things if you would let them save you from that think how much money i have it would be like taking a burthen from me if you took some of it every year till you got free from this fettering want of income why should not people do these things it is
