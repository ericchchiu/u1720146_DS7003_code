does it seem incongruous to you that a middlemarch surgeon should dream of himself as a discoverer most of us indeed know little of the great originators until they have been lifted up among the constellations and already rule our fates but that herschel for example who broke the barriers of the heavens did he not once play a provincial church organ and give music lessons to stumbling pianists each of those shining ones had to walk on the earth among neighbors who perhaps thought much more of his gait and his garments than of anything which was to give him a title to everlasting fame each of them had his little local personal history sprinkled with small temptations and sordid cares which made the retarding friction of his course towards final companionship with the immortals lydgate was not blind to the dangers of such friction but he had plenty of confidence in his resolution to avoid it as far as possible being seven and twenty he felt himself experienced and he was not going to have his vanities provoked by contact with the showy worldly successes of the capital but to live among people who could hold no rivalry with that pursuit of a great idea which was to be a twin object with the assiduous practice of his profession there was fascination in the hope that the two purposes would illuminate each other the careful observation and inference which was his daily work the use of the lens to further his judgment in special cases would further his thought as an instrument of larger inquiry was not this the typical pre eminence of his profession he would be a good middlemarch doctor and by that very means keep himself in the track of far reaching investigation on one point he may fairly claim approval at this particular stage of his career he did not mean to imitate those philanthropic models who make a profit out of poisonous pickles to support themselves while they are exposing adulteration or hold shares in a gambling hell that they may have leisure to represent the cause of public morality he intended to begin in his own case some particular reforms which were quite certainly within his reach and much less of a problem than the demonstrating of an anatomical conception one of these reforms was to act stoutly on the strength of a recent legal decision and simply prescribe without dispensing drugs or taking percentage from druggists this was an innovation for one who had chosen to adopt the style of general practitioner in a country town and would be felt as offensive criticism by his professional brethren but lydgate meant to innovate in his treatment also and he was wise enough to see that the best security for his practising honestly according to his belief was to get rid of systematic temptations to the contrary perhaps that was a more cheerful time for observers and theorizers than the present we are apt to think it the finest era of the world when america was beginning to be discovered when a bold sailor even if he were wrecked might alight on a new kingdom and about 1829 the dark territories of pathology were a fine america for a spirited young adventurer lydgate was ambitious above all to contribute towards enlarging the scientific rational basis of his profession the more he became interested in special questions of disease such as the nature of fever or fevers the more keenly he felt the need for that fundamental knowledge of structure which just at the beginning of the century had been illuminated by the brief and glorious career of bichat who died when he was only one and thirty but like another alexander left a realm large enough for many heirs that great frenchman first carried out the conception that living bodies fundamentally considered are not associations of organs which can be understood by studying them first apart and then as it were federally but must be regarded as consisting of certain primary webs or tissues out of which the various organs brain heart lungs and so on are compacted as the various accommodations of a house are built up in various proportions of wood iron stone brick zinc and the rest each material having its peculiar composition and proportions no man one sees can understand and estimate the entire structure or its parts what are its frailties and what its repairs without knowing the nature of the materials and the conception wrought out by bichat with his detailed study of the different tissues acted necessarily on medical questions as the turning of gas light would act on a dim oil lit street showing new connections and hitherto hidden facts of structure which must be taken into account in considering the symptoms of maladies and the action of medicaments but results which depend on human conscience and intelligence work slowly and now at the end of 1829 most medical practice was still strutting or shambling along the old paths and there was still scientific work to be done which might have seemed to be a direct sequence of bichat s this great seer did not go beyond the consideration of the tissues as ultimate facts in the living organism marking the limit of anatomical analysis but it was open to another mind to say have not these structures some common basis from which they have all started as your sarsnet gauze net satin and velvet from the raw cocoon here would be another light as of oxy hydrogen showing the very grain of things and revising all former explanations of this sequence to bichat s work already vibrating along many currents of the european mind lydgate was enamoured he longed to demonstrate the more intimate relations of living structure and help to define men s thought more accurately after the true order the work had not yet been done but only prepared for those who knew how to use the preparation what was the primitive tissue in that way lydgate put the question not quite in the way required by the awaiting answer but such missing of the right word befalls many seekers and he counted on quiet intervals to be watchfully seized for taking up the threads of investigation on many hints to be won from diligent application not only of the scalpel but of the microscope which research had begun to use again with new enthusiasm of reliance such was lydgate s plan of his future to do good small work for middlemarch and great work for the world he was certainly a happy fellow at this time to be seven and twenty without any fixed vices with a generous resolution that his action should be beneficent and with ideas in his brain that made life interesting quite apart from the cultus of horseflesh and other mystic rites of costly observance which the eight hundred pounds left him after buying his practice would certainly not have gone far in paying for he was at a starting point which makes many a man s career a fine subject for betting if there were any gentlemen given to that amusement who could appreciate the complicated probabilities of an arduous purpose with all the possible thwartings and furtherings of circumstance all the niceties of inward balance by which a man swims and makes his point or else is carried headlong the risk would remain even with close knowledge of lydgate s character for character too is a process and an unfolding the man was still in the making as much as the middlemarch doctor and immortal discoverer and there were both virtues and faults capable of shrinking or expanding the faults will not i hope be a reason for the withdrawal of your interest in him among our valued friends is there not some one or other who is a little too self confident and disdainful whose distinguished mind is a little spotted with commonness who is a little pinched here and protuberant there with native prejudices or whose better energies are liable to lapse down the wrong channel under the influence of transient solicitations all these things might be alleged against lydgate but then they are the periphrases of a polite preacher who talks of adam and would not like to mention anything painful to the pew renters the particular faults from which these delicate generalities are distilled have distinguishable physiognomies diction accent and grimaces filling up parts in very various dramas our vanities differ as our noses do all conceit is not the same conceit but varies in correspondence with the minutiae of mental make in which one of us differs from another lydgate s conceit was of the arrogant sort never simpering never impertinent but massive in its claims and benevolently contemptuous he would do a great deal for noodles being sorry for them and feeling quite sure that they could have no power over him he had thought of joining the saint simonians when he was in paris in order to turn them against some of their own doctrines all his faults were marked by kindred traits and were those of a man who had a fine baritone whose clothes hung well upon him and who even in his ordinary gestures had an air of inbred distinction where then lay the spots of commonness says a young lady enamoured of that careless grace how could there be any commonness in a man so well bred so ambitious of social distinction so generous and unusual in his views of social duty as easily as there may be stupidity in a man of genius if you take him unawares on the wrong subject or as many a man who has the best will to advance the social millennium might be ill inspired in imagining its lighter pleasures unable to go beyond offenbach s music or the brilliant punning in the last burlesque lydgate s spots of commonness lay in the complexion of his prejudices which in spite of noble intention and sympathy were half of them such as are found in ordinary men of the world that distinction of mind which belonged to his intellectual ardor did not penetrate his feeling and judgment about furniture or women or the desirability of its being known without his telling that he was better born than other country surgeons he did not mean to think of furniture at present but whenever he did so it was to be feared that neither biology nor schemes of reform would lift him above the vulgarity of feeling that there would be an incompatibility in his furniture not being of the best as to women he had once already been drawn headlong by impetuous folly which he meant to be final since marriage at some distant period would of course not be impetuous for those who want to be acquainted with lydgate it will be good to know what was that case of impetuous folly for it may stand as an example of the fitful swerving of passion to which he was prone together with the chivalrous kindness which helped to make him morally lovable the story can be told without many words it happened when he was studying in paris and just at the time when over and above his other work he was occupied with some galvanic experiments one evening tired with his experimenting and not being able to elicit the facts he needed he left his frogs and rabbits to some repose under their trying and mysterious dispensation of unexplained shocks and went to finish his evening at the theatre of the porte saint martin where there was a melodrama which he had already seen several times attracted not by the ingenious work of the collaborating authors but by an actress whose part it was to stab her lover mistaking him for the evil designing duke of the piece lydgate was in love with this actress as a man is in love with a woman whom he never expects to speak to she was a provencale with dark eyes a greek profile and rounded majestic form having that sort of beauty which carries a sweet matronliness even in youth and her voice was a soft cooing she had but lately come to paris and bore a virtuous reputation her husband acting with her as the unfortunate lover it was her acting which was no better than it should be but the public was satisfied lydgate s only relaxation now was to go and look at this woman just as he might have thrown himself under the breath of the sweet south on a bank of violets for a while without prejudice to his galvanism to which he would presently return but this evening the old drama had a new catastrophe at the moment when the heroine was to act the stabbing of her lover and he was to fall gracefully the wife veritably stabbed her husband who fell as death willed a wild shriek pierced the house and the provencale fell swooning a shriek and a swoon were demanded by the play but the swooning too was real this time lydgate leaped and climbed he hardly knew how on to the stage and was active in help making the acquaintance of his heroine by finding a contusion on her head and lifting her gently in his arms paris rang with the story of this death was it a murder some of the actress s warmest admirers were inclined to believe in her guilt and liked her the better for it such was the taste of those times but lydgate was not one of these he vehemently contended for her innocence and the remote impersonal passion for her beauty which he had felt before had passed now into personal devotion and tender thought of her lot the notion of murder was absurd no motive was discoverable the young couple being understood to dote on each other and it was not unprecedented that an accidental slip of the foot should have brought these grave consequences the legal investigation ended in madame laure s release lydgate by this time had had many interviews with her and found her more and more adorable she talked little but that was an additional charm she was melancholy and seemed grateful her presence was enough like that of the evening light lydgate was madly anxious about her affection and jealous lest any other man than himself should win it and ask her to marry him but instead of reopening her engagement at the porte saint martin where she would have been all the more popular for the fatal episode she left paris without warning forsaking her little court of admirers perhaps no one carried inquiry far except lydgate who felt that all science had come to a stand still while he imagined the unhappy laure stricken by ever wandering sorrow herself wandering and finding no faithful comforter hidden actresses however are not so difficult to find as some other hidden facts and it was not long before lydgate gathered indications that laure had taken the route to lyons he found her at last acting with great success at avignon under the same name looking more majestic than ever as a forsaken wife carrying her child in her arms he spoke to her after the play was received with the usual quietude which seemed to him beautiful as clear depths of water and obtained leave to visit her the next day when he was bent on telling her that he adored her and on asking her to marry him he knew that this was like the sudden impulse of a madman incongruous even with his habitual foibles no matter it was the one thing which he was resolved to do he had two selves within him apparently and they must learn to accommodate each other and bear reciprocal impediments strange that some of us with quick alternate vision see beyond our infatuations and even while we rave on the heights behold the wide plain where our persistent self pauses and awaits us to have approached laure with any suit that was not reverentially tender would have been simply a contradiction of his whole feeling towards her you have come all the way from paris to find me she said to him the next day sitting before him with folded arms and looking at him with eyes that seemed to wonder as an untamed ruminating animal wonders are all englishmen like that i came because i could not live without trying to see you you are lonely i love you i want you to consent to be my wife i will wait but i want you to promise that you will marry me no one else laure looked at him in silence with a melancholy radiance from under her grand eyelids until he was full of rapturous certainty and knelt close to her knees i will tell you something she said in her cooing way keeping her arms folded my foot really slipped i know i know said lydgate deprecatingly it was a fatal accident a dreadful stroke of calamity that bound me to you the more again laure paused a little and then said slowly i meant to do it lydgate strong man as he was turned pale and trembled moments seemed to pass before he rose and stood at a distance from her there was a secret then he said at last even vehemently he was brutal to you you hated him no he wearied me he was too fond he would live in paris and not in my country that was not agreeable to me great god said lydgate in a groan of horror and you planned to murder him i did not plan it came to me in the play i meant to do it lydgate stood mute and unconsciously pressed his hat on while he looked at her he saw this woman the first to whom he had given his young adoration amid the throng of stupid criminals you are a good young man she said but i do not like husbands i will never have another three days afterwards lydgate was at his galvanism again in his paris chambers believing that illusions were at an end for him he was saved from hardening effects by the abundant kindness of his heart and his belief that human life might be made better but he had more reason than ever for trusting his judgment now that it was so experienced and henceforth he would take a strictly scientific view of woman entertaining no expectations but such as were justified beforehand no one in middlemarch was likely to have such a notion of lydgate s past as has here been faintly shadowed and indeed the respectable townsfolk there were not more given than mortals generally to any eager attempt at exactness in the representation to themselves of what did not come under their own senses not only young virgins of that town but gray bearded men also were often in haste to conjecture how a new acquaintance might be wrought into their purposes contented with very vague knowledge as to the way in which life had been shaping him for that instrumentality middlemarch in fact counted on swallowing lydgate and assimilating him very comfortably the question whether mr tyke should be appointed as salaried chaplain to the hospital was an exciting topic to the middlemarchers and lydgate heard it discussed in a way that threw much light on the power exercised in the town by mr bulstrode the banker was evidently a ruler but there was an opposition party and even among his supporters there were some who allowed it to be seen that their support was a compromise and who frankly stated their impression that the general scheme of things and especially the casualties of trade required you to hold a candle to the devil mr bulstrode s power was not due simply to his being a country banker who knew the financial secrets of most traders in the town and could touch the springs of their credit it was fortified by a beneficence that was at once ready and severe ready to confer obligations and severe in watching the result he had gathered as an industrious man always at his post a chief share in administering the town charities and his private charities were both minute and abundant he would take a great deal of pains about apprenticing tegg the shoemaker s son and he would watch over tegg s church going he would defend mrs strype the washerwoman against stubbs s unjust exaction on the score of her drying ground and he would himself scrutinize a calumny against mrs strype his private minor loans were numerous but he would inquire strictly into the circumstances both before and after in this way a man gathers a domain in his neighbors hope and fear as well as gratitude and power when once it has got into that subtle region propagates itself spreading out of all proportion to its external means it was a principle with mr bulstrode to gain as much power as possible that he might use it for the glory of god he went through a great deal of spiritual conflict and inward argument in order to adjust his motives and make clear to himself what god s glory required but as we have seen his motives were not always rightly appreciated there were many crass minds in middlemarch whose reflective scales could only weigh things in the lump and they had a strong suspicion that since mr bulstrode could not enjoy life in their fashion eating and drinking so little as he did and worreting himself about everything he must have a sort of vampire s feast in the sense of mastery the subject of the chaplaincy came up at mr vincy s table when lydgate was dining there and the family connection with mr bulstrode did not he observed prevent some freedom of remark even on the part of the host himself though his reasons against the proposed arrangement turned entirely on his objection to mr tyke s sermons which were all doctrine and his preference for mr farebrother whose sermons were free from that taint mr vincy liked well enough the notion of the chaplain s having a salary supposing it were given to farebrother who was as good a little fellow as ever breathed and the best preacher anywhere and companionable too what line shall you take then said mr chichely the coroner a great coursing comrade of mr vincy s oh i m precious glad i m not one of the directors now i shall vote for referring the matter to the directors and the medical board together i shall roll some of my responsibility on your shoulders doctor said mr vincy glancing first at dr sprague the senior physician of the town and then at lydgate who sat opposite you medical gentlemen must consult which sort of black draught you will prescribe eh mr lydgate i know little of either said lydgate but in general appointments are apt to be made too much a question of personal liking the fittest man for a particular post is not always the best fellow or the most agreeable sometimes if you wanted to get a reform your only way would be to pension off the good fellows whom everybody is fond of and put them out of the question dr sprague who was considered the physician of most weight though dr minchin was usually said to have more penetration divested his large heavy face of all expression and looked at his wine glass while lydgate was speaking whatever was not problematical and suspected about this young man for example a certain showiness as to foreign ideas and a disposition to unsettle what had been settled and forgotten by his elders was positively unwelcome to a physician whose standing had been fixed thirty years before by a treatise on meningitis of which at least one copy marked own was bound in calf for my part i have some fellow feeling with dr sprague one s self satisfaction is an untaxed kind of property which it is very unpleasant to find deprecated lydgate s remark however did not meet the sense of the company mr vincy said that if he could have his way he would not put disagreeable fellows anywhere hang your reforms said mr chichely there s no greater humbug in the world you never hear of a reform but it means some trick to put in new men i hope you are not one of the lancet s men mr lydgate wanting to take the coronership out of the hands of the legal profession your words appear to point that way i disapprove of wakley interposed dr sprague no man more he is an ill intentioned fellow who would sacrifice the respectability of the profession which everybody knows depends on the london colleges for the sake of getting some notoriety for himself there are men who don t mind about being kicked blue if they can only get talked about but wakley is right sometimes the doctor added judicially i could mention one or two points in which wakley is in the right oh well said mr chichely i blame no man for standing up in favor of his own cloth but coming to argument i should like to know how a coroner is to judge of evidence if he has not had a legal training in my opinion said lydgate legal training only makes a man more incompetent in questions that require knowledge of another kind people talk about evidence as if it could really be weighed in scales by a blind justice no man can judge what is good evidence on any particular subject unless he knows that subject well a lawyer is no better than an old woman at a post mortem examination how is he to know the action of a poison you might as well say that scanning verse will teach you to scan the potato crops you are aware i suppose that it is not the coroner s business to conduct the post mortem but only to take the evidence of the medical witness said mr chichely with some scorn who is often almost as ignorant as the coroner himself said lydgate questions of medical jurisprudence ought not to be left to the chance of decent knowledge in a medical witness and the coroner ought not to be a man who will believe that strychnine will destroy the coats of the stomach if an ignorant practitioner happens to tell him so lydgate had really lost sight of the fact that mr chichely was his majesty s coroner and ended innocently with the question don t you agree with me dr sprague to a certain extent with regard to populous districts and in the metropolis said the doctor but i hope it will be long before this part of the country loses the services of my friend chichely even though it might get the best man in our profession to succeed him i am sure vincy will agree with me yes yes give me a coroner who is a good coursing man said mr vincy jovially and in my opinion you re safest with a lawyer nobody can know everything most things are visitation of god and as to poisoning why what you want to know is the law come shall we join the ladies lydgate s private opinion was that mr chichely might be the very coroner without bias as to the coats of the stomach but he had not meant to be personal this was one of the difficulties of moving in good middlemarch society it was dangerous to insist on knowledge as a qualification for any salaried office fred vincy had called lydgate a prig and now mr chichely was inclined to call him prick eared especially when in the drawing room he seemed to be making himself eminently agreeable to rosamond whom he had easily monopolized in a tête à tête since mrs vincy herself sat at the tea table she resigned no domestic function to her daughter and the matron s blooming good natured face with the two volatile pink strings floating from her fine throat and her cheery manners to husband and children was certainly among the great attractions of the vincy house attractions which made it all the easier to fall in love with the daughter the tinge of unpretentious inoffensive vulgarity in mrs vincy gave more effect to rosamond s refinement which was beyond what lydgate had expected certainly small feet and perfectly turned shoulders aid the impression of refined manners and the right thing said seems quite astonishingly right when it is accompanied with exquisite curves of lip and eyelid and rosamond could say the right thing for she was clever with that sort of cleverness which catches every tone except the humorous happily she never attempted to joke and this perhaps was the most decisive mark of her cleverness she and lydgate readily got into conversation he regretted that he had not heard her sing the other day at stone court the only pleasure he allowed himself during the latter part of his stay in paris was to go and hear music you have studied music probably said rosamond no i know the notes of many birds and i know many melodies by ear but the music that i don t know at all and have no notion about delights me affects me how stupid the world is that it does not make more use of such a pleasure within its reach yes and you will find middlemarch very tuneless there are hardly any good musicians i only know two gentlemen who sing at all well i suppose it is the fashion to sing comic songs in a rhythmic way leaving you to fancy the tune very much as if it were tapped on a drum ah you have heard mr bowyer said rosamond with one of her rare smiles but we are speaking very ill of our neighbors lydgate was almost forgetting that he must carry on the conversation in thinking how lovely this creature was her garment seeming to be made out of the faintest blue sky herself so immaculately blond as if the petals of some gigantic flower had just opened and disclosed her and yet with this infantine blondness showing so much ready self possessed grace since he had had the memory of laure lydgate had lost all taste for large eyed silence the divine cow no longer attracted him and rosamond was her very opposite but he recalled himself you will let me hear some music to night i hope i will let you hear my attempts if you like said rosamond papa is sure to insist on my singing but i shall tremble before you who have heard the best singers in paris i have heard very little i have only once been to london but our organist at st peter s is a good musician and i go on studying with him tell me what you saw in london very little a more naive girl would have said oh everything but rosamond knew better a few of the ordinary sights such as raw country girls are always taken to do you call yourself a raw country girl said lydgate looking at her with an involuntary emphasis of admiration which made rosamond blush with pleasure but she remained simply serious turned her long neck a little and put up her hand to touch her wondrous hair plaits an habitual gesture with her as pretty as any movements of a kitten s paw not that rosamond was in the least like a kitten she was a sylph caught young and educated at mrs lemon s i assure you my mind is raw she said immediately i pass at middlemarch i am not afraid of talking to our old neighbors but i am really afraid of you an accomplished woman almost always knows more than we men though her knowledge is of a different sort i am sure you could teach me a thousand things as an exquisite bird could teach a bear if there were any common language between them happily there is a common language between women and men and so the bears can get taught ah there is fred beginning to strum i must go and hinder him from jarring all your nerves said rosamond moving to the other side of the room where fred having opened the piano at his father s desire that rosamond might give them some music was parenthetically performing cherry ripe with one hand able men who have passed their examinations will do these things sometimes not less than the plucked fred fred pray defer your practising till to morrow you will make mr lydgate ill said rosamond he has an ear fred laughed and went on with his tune to the end rosamond turned to lydgate smiling gently and said you perceive the bears will not always be taught now then rosy said fred springing from the stool and twisting it
