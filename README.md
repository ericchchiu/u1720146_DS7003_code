WARNING!!! because there is a non-ascii character Ã¢ in the code, after importing the code to RStudio, one should select File -> Reopen with encoding... then select UTF-8 (Windows)

One of the two data files to be used in this project,  Gungor_2018_VictorianAuthorAttribution_data-train.csv, is too large (259,361KB) to be uploaded to github. Please download it from:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Victorian+Era+Authorship+Attribution

(Or if the abovementioned data file has not been placed in the working directory mentioned below before running the R code, the R code will use a few minutes to download and unzip the data file)

The data file was produced by Abdulmecit Gungor for writing the thesis:
Gungor A. (2018) Benchmarking authorship attribution techniques using over a thousand books by fifty Victorian Era novelists, Unpublished MSc Thesis, Purdue University, Available at: https://scholarworks.iupui.edu/handle/1805/15938 (Accessed: 16 May 2020).

The another data file, GutenbergATaleOf2C3Middlemarch5TessOfTheDUrb3Each4000Words.csv, is in this repository. This data file was produced with the three text files contained in this reporsitory. The three text files were obtained from https://www.gutenberg.org/

Just place all files and the downloaded file mentioned above into a working directory, import the R code files to an RStudio and then run them.

The R code JaneAustenAndJohnMuirTokenizers3Hrs.r needs 3 hours+ to run. If you really want to run it, it is suggested that you should run JaneAustenAndJohnMuirTmDtm first to make sure that your RStudio can run the R code included in this reporsitory.

For further details, please see the coursework 'A study about using machine learning classifiers KNN and SVM to perform authorship attribution analysis' which is contained in u1720146_DS7003_final.docx
