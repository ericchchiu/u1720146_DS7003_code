she was seeing it then to decline to marry him after all in obedience to her emotion of last night and leave the dairy meant to go to some strange place not a dairy for milkmaids were not in request now calving time was coming on to go to some arable farm where no divine being like angel clare was she hated the thought and she hated more the thought of going home so that seriously dearest tess he continued since you will probably have to leave at christmas it is in every way desirable and convenient that i should carry you off then as my property besides if you were not the most uncalculating girl in the world you would know that we could not go on like this for ever i wish we could that it would always be summer and autumn and you always courting me and always thinking as much of me as you have done through the past summer time i always shall o i know you will she cried with a sudden fervour of faith in him angel i will fix the day when i will become yours for always thus at last it was arranged between them during that dark walk home amid the myriads of liquid voices on the right and left when they reached the dairy mr and mrs crick were promptly told with injunctions of secrecy for each of the lovers was desirous that the marriage should be kept as private as possible the dairyman though he had thought of dismissing her soon now made a great concern about losing her what should he do about his skimming who would make the ornamental butter pats for the anglebury and sandbourne ladies mrs crick congratulated tess on the shilly shallying having at last come to an end and said that directly she set eyes on tess she divined that she was to be the chosen one of somebody who was no common outdoor man tess had looked so superior as she walked across the barton on that afternoon of her arrival that she was of a good family she could have sworn in point of fact mrs crick did remember thinking that tess was graceful and good looking as she approached but the superiority might have been a growth of the imagination aided by subsequent knowledge tess was now carried along upon the wings of the hours without the sense of a will the word had been given the number of the day written down her naturally bright intelligence had begun to admit the fatalistic convictions common to field folk and those who associate more extensively with natural phenomena than with their fellow creatures and she accordingly drifted into that passive responsiveness to all things her lover suggested characteristic of the frame of mind but she wrote anew to her mother ostensibly to notify the wedding day really to again implore her advice it was a gentleman who had chosen her which perhaps her mother had not sufficiently considered a post nuptial explanation which might be accepted with a light heart by a rougher man might not be received with the same feeling by him but this communication brought no reply from mrs durbeyfield despite angel clare s plausible representation to himself and to tess of the practical need for their immediate marriage there was in truth an element of precipitancy in the step as became apparent at a later date he loved her dearly though perhaps rather ideally and fancifully than with the impassioned thoroughness of her feeling for him he had entertained no notion when doomed as he had thought to an unintellectual bucolic life that such charms as he beheld in this idyllic creature would be found behind the scenes unsophistication was a thing to talk of but he had not known how it really struck one until he came here yet he was very far from seeing his future track clearly and it might be a year or two before he would be able to consider himself fairly started in life the secret lay in the tinge of recklessness imparted to his career and character by the sense that he had been made to miss his true destiny through the prejudices of his family don t you think twould have been better for us to wait till you were quite settled in your midland farm she once asked timidly a midland farm was the idea just then to tell the truth my tess i don t like you to be left anywhere away from my protection and sympathy the reason was a good one so far as it went his influence over her had been so marked that she had caught his manner and habits his speech and phrases his likings and his aversions and to leave her in farmland would be to let her slip back again out of accord with him he wished to have her under his charge for another reason his parents had naturally desired to see her once at least before he carried her off to a distant settlement english or colonial and as no opinion of theirs was to be allowed to change his intention he judged that a couple of months life with him in lodgings whilst seeking for an advantageous opening would be of some social assistance to her at what she might feel to be a trying ordeal her presentation to his mother at the vicarage next he wished to see a little of the working of a flour mill having an idea that he might combine the use of one with corn growing the proprietor of a large old water mill at wellbridge once the mill of an abbey had offered him the inspection of his time honoured mode of procedure and a hand in the operations for a few days whenever he should choose to come clare paid a visit to the place some few miles distant one day at this time to inquire particulars and returned to talbothays in the evening she found him determined to spend a short time at the wellbridge flour mills and what had determined him less the opportunity of an insight into grinding and bolting than the casual fact that lodgings were to be obtained in that very farmhouse which before its mutilation had been the mansion of a branch of the durberville family this was always how clare settled practical questions by a sentiment which had nothing to do with them they decided to go immediately after the wedding and remain for a fortnight instead of journeying to towns and inns then we will start off to examine some farms on the other side of london that i have heard of he said and by march or april we will pay a visit to my father and mother questions of procedure such as these arose and passed and the day the incredible day on which she was to become his loomed large in the near future the thirty first of december new year s eve was the date his wife she said to herself could it ever be their two selves together nothing to divide them every incident shared by them why not and yet why one sunday morning izz huett returned from church and spoke privately to tess you was not called home this morning what it should ha been the first time of asking to day she answered looking quietly at tess you meant to be married new year s eve deary the other returned a quick affirmative and there must be three times of asking and now there be only two sundays left between tess felt her cheek paling izz was right of course there must be three perhaps he had forgotten if so there must be a week s postponement and that was unlucky how could she remind her lover she who had been so backward was suddenly fired with impatience and alarm lest she should lose her dear prize a natural incident relieved her anxiety izz mentioned the omission of the banns to mrs crick and mrs crick assumed a matron s privilege of speaking to angel on the point have ye forgot em mr clare the banns i mean no i have not forgot em says clare as soon as he caught tess alone he assured her don t let them tease you about the banns a licence will be quieter for us and i have decided on a licence without consulting you so if you go to church on sunday morning you will not hear your own name if you wished to i didn t wish to hear it dearest she said proudly but to know that things were in train was an immense relief to tess notwithstanding who had well nigh feared that somebody would stand up and forbid the banns on the ground of her history how events were favouring her i don t quite feel easy she said to herself all this good fortune may be scourged out of me afterwards by a lot of ill that s how heaven mostly does i wish i could have had common banns but everything went smoothly she wondered whether he would like her to be married in her present best white frock or if she ought to buy a new one the question was set at rest by his forethought disclosed by the arrival of some large packages addressed to her inside them she found a whole stock of clothing from bonnet to shoes including a perfect morning costume such as would well suit the simple wedding they planned he entered the house shortly after the arrival of the packages and heard her upstairs undoing them a minute later she came down with a flush on her face and tears in her eyes how thoughtful you ve been she murmured her cheek upon his shoulder even to the gloves and handkerchief my own love how good how kind no no tess just an order to a tradeswoman in london nothing more and to divert her from thinking too highly of him he told her to go upstairs and take her time and see if it all fitted and if not to get the village sempstress to make a few alterations she did return upstairs and put on the gown alone she stood for a moment before the glass looking at the effect of her silk attire and then there came into her head her mother s ballad of the mystic robe that never would become that wife that had once done amiss which mrs durbeyfield had used to sing to her as a child so blithely and so archly her foot on the cradle which she rocked to the tune suppose this robe should betray her by changing colour as her robe had betrayed queen guinevere since she had been at the dairy she had not once thought of the lines till now angel felt that he would like to spend a day with her before the wedding somewhere away from the dairy as a last jaunt in her company while there were yet mere lover and mistress a romantic day in circumstances that would never be repeated with that other and greater day beaming close ahead of them during the preceding week therefore he suggested making a few purchases in the nearest town and they started together clare s life at the dairy had been that of a recluse in respect the world of his own class for months he had never gone near a town and requiring no vehicle had never kept one hiring the dairyman s cob or gig if he rode or drove they went in the gig that day and then for the first time in their lives they shopped as partners in one concern it was christmas eve with its loads a holly and mistletoe and the town was very full of strangers who had come in from all parts of the country on account of the day tess paid the penalty of walking about with happiness superadded to beauty on her countenance by being much stared at as she moved amid them on his arm in the evening they returned to the inn at which they had put up and tess waited in the entry while angel went to see the horse and gig brought to the door the general sitting room was full of guests who were continually going in and out as the door opened and shut each time for the passage of these the light within the parlour fell full upon tess s face two men came out and passed by her among the rest one of them had stared her up and down in surprise and she fancied he was a trantridge man though that village lay so many miles off that trantridge folk were rarities here a comely maid that said the other true comely enough but unless i make a great mistake and he negatived the remainder of the definition forthwith clare had just returned from the stable yard and confronting the man on the threshold heard the words and saw the shrinking of tess the insult to her stung him to the quick and before he had considered anything at all he struck the man on the chin with the full force of his fist sending him staggering backwards into the passage the man recovered himself and seemed inclined to come on and clare stepping outside the door put himself in a posture of defence but his opponent began to think better of the matter he looked anew at tess as he passed her and said to clare i beg pardon sir twas a complete mistake i thought she was another woman forty miles from here clare feeling then that he had been too hasty and that he was moreover to blame for leaving her standing in an inn passage did what he usually did in such cases gave the man five shillings to plaster the blow and thus they parted bidding each other a pacific good night as soon as clare had taken the reins from the ostler and the young couple had driven off the two men went in the other direction and was it a mistake said the second one not a bit of it but i didn t want to hurt the gentleman s feelings not i in the meantime the lovers were driving onward could we put off our wedding till a little later tess asked in a dry dull voice i mean if we wished no my love calm yourself do you mean that the fellow may have time to summon me for assault he asked good humouredly no i only meant if it should have to be put off what she meant was not very clear and he directed her to dismiss such fancies from her mind which she obediently did as well as she could but she was grave very grave all the way home till she thought we shall go away a very long distance hundreds of miles from these parts and such as this can never happen again and no ghost of the past reach there they parted tenderly that night on the landing and clare ascended to his attic tess sat up getting on with some little requisites lest the few remaining days should not afford sufficient time while she sat she heard a noise in angel s room overhead a sound of thumping and struggling everybody else in the house was asleep and in her anxiety lest clare should be ill she ran up and knocked at his door and asked him what was the matter oh nothing dear he said from within i am so sorry i disturbed you but the reason is rather an amusing one i fell asleep and dreamt that i was fighting that fellow again who insulted you and the noise you heard was my pummelling away with my fists at my portmanteau which i pulled out to day for packing i am occasionally liable to these freaks in my sleep go to bed and think of it no more this was the last drachm required to turn the scale of her indecision declare the past to him by word of mouth she could not but there was another way she sat down and wrote on the four pages of a note sheet a succinct narrative of those events of three or four years ago put it into an envelope and directed it to clare then lest the flesh should again be weak she crept upstairs without any shoes and slipped the note under his door her night was a broken one as it well might be and she listened for the first faint noise overhead it came as usual he descended as usual she descended he met her at the bottom of the stairs and kissed her surely it was as warmly as ever he looked a little disturbed and worn she thought but he said not a word to her about her revelation even when they were alone could he have had it unless he began the subject she felt that she could say nothing so the day passed and it was evident that whatever he thought he meant to keep to himself yet he was frank and affectionate as before could it be that her doubts were childish that he forgave her that he loved her for what she was just as she was and smiled at her disquiet as at a foolish nightmare had he really received her note she glanced into his room and could see nothing of it it might be that he forgave her but even if he had not received it she had a sudden enthusiastic trust that he surely would forgive her every morning and night he was the same and thus new year s eve broke the wedding day the lovers did not rise at milking time having through the whole of this last week of their sojourn at the dairy been accorded something of the position of guests tess being honoured with a room of her own when they arrived downstairs at breakfast time they were surprised to see what effects had been produced in the large kitchen for their glory since they had last beheld it at some unnatural hour of the morning the dairyman had caused the yawning chimney corner to be whitened and the brick hearth reddened and a blazing yellow damask blower to be hung across the arch in place of the old grimy blue cotton one with a black sprig pattern which had formerly done duty there this renovated aspect of what was the focus indeed of the room on a full winter morning threw a smiling demeanour over the whole apartment i was determined to do summat in honour o t said the dairyman and as you wouldn t hear of my gieing a rattling good randy wi fiddles and bass viols complete as we should ha done in old times this was all i could think o as a noiseless thing tess s friends lived so far off that none could conveniently have been present at the ceremony even had any been asked but as a fact nobody was invited from marlott as for angel s family he had written and duly informed them of the time and assured them that he would be glad to see one at least of them there for the day if he would like to come his brothers had not replied at all seeming to be indignant with him while his father and mother had written a rather sad letter deploring his precipitancy in rushing into marriage but making the best of the matter by saying that though a dairywoman was the last daughter in law they could have expected their son had arrived at an age which he might be supposed to be the best judge this coolness in his relations distressed clare less than it would have done had he been without the grand card with which he meant to surprise them ere long to produce tess fresh from the dairy as a durberville and a lady he had felt to be temerarious and risky hence he had concealed her lineage till such time as familiarized with worldly ways by a few months travel and reading with him he could take her on a visit to his parents and impart the knowledge while triumphantly producing her as worthy of such an ancient line it was a pretty lover s dream if no more perhaps tess s lineage had more value for himself than for anybody in the world beside her perception that angel s bearing towards her still remained in no whit altered by her own communication rendered tess guiltily doubtful if he could have received it she rose from breakfast before he had finished and hastened upstairs it had occurred to her to look once more into the queer gaunt room which had been clare s den or rather eyrie for so long and climbing the ladder she stood at the open door of the apartment regarding and pondering she stooped to the threshold of the doorway where she had pushed in the note two or three days earlier in such excitement the carpet reached close to the sill and under the edge of the carpet she discerned the faint white margin of the envelope containing her letter to him which he obviously had never seen owing to her having in her haste thrust it beneath the carpet as well as beneath the door with a feeling of faintness she withdrew the letter there it was sealed up just as it had left her hands the mountain had not yet been removed she could not let him read it now the house being in full bustle of preparation and descending to her own room she destroyed the letter there she was so pale when he saw her again that he felt quite anxious the incident of the misplaced letter she had jumped at as if it prevented a confession but she knew in her conscience that it need not there was still time yet everything was in a stir there was coming and going all had to dress the dairyman and mrs crick having been asked to accompany them as witnesses and reflection or deliberate talk was well nigh impossible the only minute tess could get to be alone with clare was when they met upon the landing i am so anxious to talk to you i want to confess all my faults and blunders she said with attempted lightness no no we can t have faults talked of you must be deemed perfect to day at least my sweet he cried we shall have plenty of time hereafter i hope to talk over our failings i will confess mine at the same time but it would be better for me to do it now i think so that you could not say well my quixotic one you shall tell me anything say as soon as we are settled in our lodging not now i too will tell you my faults then but do not let us spoil the day with them they will be excellent matter for a dull time then you don t wish me to dearest i do not tessy really the hurry of dressing and starting left no time for more than this those words of his seemed to reassure her on further reflection she was whirled onward through the next couple of critical hours by the mastering tide of her devotion to him which closed up further meditation her one desire so long resisted to make herself his to call him her lord her own then if necessary to die had at last lifted her up from her plodding reflective pathway in dressing she moved about in a mental cloud of many coloured idealities which eclipsed all sinister contingencies by its brightness the church was a long way off and they were obliged to drive particularly as it was winter a closed carriage was ordered from a roadside inn a vehicle which had been kept there ever since the old days of post chaise travelling it had stout wheel spokes and heavy felloes a great curved bed immense straps and springs and a pole like a battering ram the postilion was a venerable boy of sixty a martyr to rheumatic gout the result of excessive exposure in youth counter acted by strong liquors who had stood at inn doors doing nothing for the whole five and twenty years that had elapsed since he had no longer been required to ride professionally as if expecting the old times to come back again he had a permanent running wound on the outside of his right leg originated by the constant bruisings of aristocratic carriage poles during the many years that he had been in regular employ at the king s arms casterbridge inside this cumbrous and creaking structure and behind this decayed conductor the partie carrée took their seats the bride and bridegroom and mr and mrs crick angel would have liked one at least of his brothers to be present as groomsman but their silence after his gentle hint to that effect by letter had signified that they did not care to come they disapproved of the marriage and could not be expected to countenance it perhaps it was as well that they could not be present they were not worldly young fellows but fraternizing with dairy folk would have struck unpleasantly upon their biased niceness apart from their views of the match upheld by the momentum of the time tess knew nothing of this did not see anything did not know the road they were taking to the church she knew that angel was close to her all the rest was a luminous mist she was a sort of celestial person who owed her being to poetry one of those classical divinities clare was accustomed to talk to her about when they took their walks together the marriage being by licence there were only a dozen or so of people in the church had there been a thousand they would have produced no more effect upon her they were at stellar distances from her present world in the ecstatic solemnity with which she swore her faith to him the ordinary sensibilities of sex seemed a flippancy at a pause in the service while they were kneeling together she unconsciously inclined herself towards him so that her shoulder touched his arm she had been frightened by a passing thought and the movement had been automatic to assure herself that he was really there and to fortify her belief that his fidelity would be proof against all things clare knew that she loved him every curve of her form showed that but he did not know at that time the full depth of her devotion its single mindedness its meekness what long suffering it guaranteed what honesty what endurance what good faith as they came out of church the ringers swung the bells off their rests and a modest peal of three notes broke forth that limited amount of expression having been deemed sufficient by the church builders for the joys of such a small parish passing by the tower with her husband on the path to the gate she could feel the vibrant air humming round them from the louvred belfry in the circle of sound and it matched the highly charged mental atmosphere in which she was living this condition of mind wherein she felt glorified by an irradiation not her own like the angel whom st john saw in the sun lasted till the sound of the church bells had died away and the emotions of the wedding service had calmed down her eyes could dwell upon details more clearly now and mr and mrs crick having directed their own gig to be sent for them to leave the carriage to the young couple she observed the build and character of that conveyance for the first time sitting in silence she regarded it long i fancy you seem oppressed tessy said clare yes she answered putting her hand to her brow i tremble at many things it is all so serious angel among other things i seem to have seen this carriage before to be very well acquainted with it it is very odd i must have seen it in a dream oh you have heard the legend of the durberville coach that well known superstition of this county about your family when they were very popular here and this lumbering old thing reminds you of it i have never heard of it to my knowledge said she what is the legend may i know it well i would rather not tell it in detail just now a certain durberville of the sixteenth or seventeenth century committed a dreadful crime in his family coach and since that time members of the family see or hear the old coach whenever but i ll tell you another day it is rather gloomy evidently some dim knowledge of it has been brought back to your mind by the sight of this venerable caravan i don t remember hearing it before she murmured is it when we are going to die angel that members of my family see it or is it when we have committed a crime now tess he silenced her by a kiss by the time they reached home she was contrite and spiritless she was mrs angel clare indeed but had she any moral right to the name was she not more truly mrs alexander durberville could intensity of love justify what might be considered in upright souls as culpable reticence she knew not what was expected of women in such cases and she had no counsellor however when she found herself alone in her room for a few minutes the last day this on which she was ever to enter it she knelt down and prayed she tried to pray to god but it was her husband who really had her supplication her idolatry of this man was such that she herself almost feared it to be ill omened she was conscious of the notion expressed by friar laurence these violent delights have violent ends it might be too desperate for human conditions too rank to wild too deadly o my love why do i love you so she whispered there alone for she you love is not my real self but one in my image the one i might have been afternoon came and with it the hour for departure they had decided to fulfil the plan of going for a few days to the lodgings in the old farmhouse near wellbridge mill at which he meant to reside during his investigation of flour processes at two o clock there was nothing left to do but to start all the servantry of the dairy were standing in the red brick entry to see them go out the dairyman and his wife following to the door tess saw her three chamber mates in a row against the
